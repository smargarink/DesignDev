Game. The best GTA now enhanced by the Xbox One is a delight to play. Given that the Original GTAV was close to a 10/10 imo, this version just finalises any doubts in my mind.\r I am very surprised that upon playing 6+ Hours of the game already the framerate was indeed very smooth. Great job by Rockstar, their game developers obviously know how to code video games before release unlike cough cough UBIFAIL.\r Coming from playing ACU last week to this was a real pleasure and I\u2019m glad some game developers still know how to optimize video games.\r Thanks for a great game Rockstar.","The updated version of this great game is a delight. The new graphics, slight new additions of vehicles and weapons, and the introduction of first-person mode all combine to make this game as great as it was on the 360. However, this is also the flaw of the game. As enjoyable as first-person mode is, the addition of a new camera-mode should not warrant the game to be sold at \u00a350. In essence, what you are getting is the same game. So if you enjoyed GTAV on the 360 you will be sure to enjoy this updated version on the One, even if it is overpriced.","Take Two and Rockstar threatened to sue a modder without good reason. This sort of toxic behavior should not be tolerated. Don't support them by giving them your money.","My best game so far, Rockstar did what they have promised to us before to give a better excitement on their newly released awesome game. For me, because of the open-world feeling it gave me a better view on what I am playing, especially the Enhanced Graphics and Smooth Frame rate. Who wouldn't play this game? ;)","One of the games that could live up to the hype! This deserves most of the praises it gets and should be played by everyone who's a fan of open world games!\r I never played the previous-gen version, so for me the 60\u20ac price tag was completely justified. I have read on the net about the improvements this version has compared to prev-gen. Aside from the awesome graphics updates the most interesting thing is the first person mode. It is fantastic and it even lets you adjust FOV! On a console! I sincerely hope other game developers implement FOV adjustment to first person games. But I still consider it too steep a price for the people who had it on a 360/PS3 just to get those improvements.\r The story is enjoyable. The thing you would expect GTA to deliver. Missions are interesting and the side quests, strangers and freaks, are a load of fun. I am still to complete the game 100% (I am at about 97%), but I've had so much fun along the way! I'm sure most players will not be \"satisfied\" with merely completing the main story line and be done with it, but they will want to see more. See the alive world of San Andreas and what does it have to offer. The random encounters make it feel even more immersive whether you're saving a girl from being raped or preventing a robbery. The rural areas are the best to roam freely and you could find something... alien there.\r Trevor is the most intriguing character. He's crazy, he's mad and he doesn't give a damn. While playing as him nothing can be boring. I love his Rampage side missions as well as the main story missions. Michael is interesting in his own way too. He has a lot of family issues and tries to get his life back on track failing at it miserably. Franklin is, in my humble opinion, boring. He's just a young guy from the suburbs who meets a couple of crazy old men. While Franklin and Lamar, his supposedly best friend, are talking, the N word just needs to be in every sentence. Twice.\r Cars behave better than they did on GTA IV and definitely better than in a certain Ubisoft game which was to compete with GTA V. It's a pleasure driving around San Andreas. You can really tell that Rockstar have made an effort to make the vehicles unique as the interiors are crafted beautifully in first person mode and you can really tell the difference whether you're driving a family sedan or an SUV.\r I heard GTA Online had some problems in launch. I bought the game two days after launch but I completed the single player first and when I did try Online it worked like a charm. I'm not really that into it though, since it seems that killing each other mindlessly is more interesting than completing jobs. To each their own I suppose.\r For me this is GOTY of 2014 but since it is a remake, it doesn't really qualify for that prize. I loved the game and continue loving it!","The game feels like a living world, you can lose yourself in it for hours. The graphics are unbelievable!\rThe new first person mode changes the way the game plays and feels. It's great!\r Rockstar does it again! Every GTA beats the previous. This is what I love about Rockstar, they're rockstars! They know how to make a game and they KEEP their gamers happy.\r Thanks again Rockstar!\rPs. I can't wait for RDR2","I completed this game on Xbox 360 first, now on Xbox One is only better. Better graphic, more cars on streets, more people around, which make some missions more difficult. The story is the strongest part. All characters are unique, charismatic and it's so easy to identify with them. The first person mode is great looking, however unnecessary. I would prefer more missions instead. Cannot say nothing bad about this game. It is nearly perfect.","Amazing graphic, great storyline, best game ever! Smooth Frame rate. Rockstar rock.I recommend to everyone, fun for hours. Meets all my expectations and included way more than I expected.","When this game first came out I thought the only thing good about it was the campaign. They didn't release the heists on time and to make up for it they only gave you 1 million dollars. However, over the years the multiplayer has gotten only better. The heists compared to what you can do now are not worth the time to put in for the money you get. However if you're just looking for good quality fun and not too worried about the money, I suggest doing all 5 heists. If you want to look into getting some good money I would start off with the CEO missions. This will run you quite a bit of money to start up the whole process. To get mine all set up for what I wanted it was a total of 8 million dollars. Do not worry. There are cheaper buildings to buy but it will run you at least 1 million to start it up. After you get your CEO cargo missions available I would do the car missions. They give big payouts when you deliver them to a new owner. You run a risk with the missions though. If you have a bunch of people in your server they will more than likely try to take your car out. I would stick to low populated servers for these missions. If it's the time of day where everyone and their brother is on I suggest the racing. The multiplayer racing is fantastic and a great way to have some good laughs, especially if you play it with friends. The best part is if you just want to mess around and blow stuff up you can still do that too. It's always fun to see how long you can hold yourself against the police.\r I give this game a high review based on the fact that when they finally got everything going with their online multiplayer it has a lot to offer with endless possibilities. This game will not be dead until they bring out a new GTA.","Last Generation's best game just got better. With new radio stations, cars, even better graphics, and the newly designed FPS mode makes you favorite game, even better. Being a huge GTA fan this was a no brainer to buy on day one. If you have never played GTA V, just get out there and buy it, you'll love yourself for it. If you have played it, the go down to the shop, buy it again and go and see what Rockstar has improved on and for laughs and giggles, go talk to Jesus on boardwalk.","In a nutshell, it's GTA V, which itself was already an amazing game, but perfected. The FPS mode, the added cars, music and weapons are also a wonderful touch to make the game better. If you've already played it on the older consoles, I don't recommend buying it since you're not missing that much as far as new content goes. But even still, this game manages to be an excellent title and a must buy for anyone who dares call themselves a gamer.","Rockstar is a company that cares about their games and cares about the consumer. A very rare thing to come by in this day and age.\r For many, paying for a copy of a game they already own might seem strange and just an act of throwing money away. However, I can tell you, this is the 2nd time I've bought GTA:V and also the 1st game I have bought on the Xbox One which makes me feel like it was money well spent.\r The game itself is beautiful, not like it wasn't before, but the step into next generation is clear cut. The world goes on forever in fantastic detail, Los Santos is a living breathing city filled with whatever your heart desires.\rFirst person is an absolutely fantastic addition, not just a novelty, a whole new way to play the Grand Theft Auto franchise (it's came a long way from 'birds eye view')\r For those of you who would have experienced GTA: Online, you would be pleased to know that the character transfer of your old character ($ and RP included) is but a simple and easy transfer. No hassle.\r This game achieves a 10/10 from me only because I simply cannot hold it in a higher regard, it ticks all the boxes and creates new ones while it's at it.\rOn the Xbox 360, this was my perfect game.\rOn the Xbox One, it's my perfect game, and then some.","Grand Theft Auto V is by far the best game that Rockstar has released into the series. The vast open-world environment paired with the simply insane gameplay often lead to a very enjoyable experience that not very many other games can offer.\rDynamic and unique gameplay seems to have been very important in the design of this game, and it certainly shows. Every single time I launch GTA, the experience is new and varied. This is especially helped by the inclusion of three main story characters, which can be switched to at will. Each of these characters is vastly different form one another in personality and abilities, but yet they fit into a much wider and gripping storyline. This is especially shown off in a few of the many story missions, where the three characters can be used seamlessly and as a team to complete a task. Rockstar knows its strengths, which is why literally the first mission in the game fully utilises this mechanic.\rThankfully, the fun and crazy action of the games missions also transfers into the free-play in between (which you can easily spend hours playing). The large map of Los Santos and Blaine County are perfectly designed to allow the player to do almost anything. Want to fly around in a jet, steal one from the military base (but try not to get shot down); feel like starting a gang war, just rock up and start one. Almost anything that the player can come up with can be achieved so brilliantly in GTA V (which can also be enhanced by the use of cheats that can be inputted). Both the free play and missions of this game have been wonderfully designed, with incredible scenes of action continuously maintained throughout. The new first-person feature has also been included in this version, adding an entirely fresh perspective on the word of GTA.\rIn addition to the story mode, Grand Theft Auto has a multiplayer alongside it. This can be switched to at any time, where many, many more options become available. GTA's multiplayer is free roam ramped up to 11, especially with the new larger lobbies that the Xbox One and PC versions of the game offer. After customising your character, you can do missions to earn in game currency, then continue to build your own little empire of illegal warehouses, upgraded vehicles and hangars full of planes. The opportunities are even greater than that of the story mode, but yet it is exactly where the only problem with GTA lies...\rHaving owned this game since it first launched, I have personally experience the incredible growth of the Online, as Rockstar add many new (and free) DLC's. These for the most part have been incredible, each becoming more ambitious than the last and expanding the game massively. However, as more and more items are added, they begin to cost more and more of the in-game's currency. This has reached the point now where it quickly becomes a boring grind to even be able to afford the cheapest of the new additions. Of course, Rockstar offer \"Shark cards\" that can be purchased with real world money and translate into game currency, but this is just adding to the issue, with Rockstar adding more and more expensive items so that they can gain more profits from the game.\rOverall Grand Theft Auto V is a massive success, which has really set a standard for open world games, but soon becomes a grind if you're interested in purchasing the newest items without having to use your real world funds.","I chose not to buy the 360 version, expecting the release of a \"next gen\" version. So, for me this is a brand new game. I cannot compare it with the last gen version. And this is one of the most fun, if not THE most fun game I've ever played. This is the first time I look at a game and I feel that we are in a new generation of gaming. Reflections at night are just incredible. I was afraid that I'd hate the driving, because as everyone says it's very arcade. While it's arcade, it is a very good arcade version of driving. It feels great even to me, and I love rally games. I prefer driving in GTA5 over GTA4. The first person view is awesome and I'm using it all the time. I'm really having a hard time finding something that could clearly be improved in this game. Also, it doesn't suffer from noticeable/annoying bugs. One of the best games ever created. Props to Rockstar Games!","GTA 5 on Xbox 1 has amazing details!! When it rains it pours, the water on the streets looks so lifelike...The lightning is killer...I've seen a few streaks that look like they should be outside....This has to be my all time favorite game....It wasn't bad on my ps3 but compared to my XB1 it's better the 2nd time around and  the changes are completely noticeable!! Have not yet played online but hope to get to do so soon!","It's Gta 5, just with improved graphics, and some added feature(like first person mode), since the first one was nearly a 10/10 this version is the same but with enough added stuff, that it gets a 10/10","Fantastic. The upgrade from the Xbox 360 version is phenomenal. I am very glad I got this game and can not wait to play through it again, especially in first person mode.","Basically the same thing as the Xbox 360 version but with greatly improved graphics, some additional vehicles, and a first person mode. How can you go wrong? Grand Theft Auto V for the Xbox One is a satisfying improvement over the Xbox 360 version. 10/10 (Legendary)","This is the first GTA I have ever played and after 100%ing it here are my thoughts.\r Pros\rBest online I have ever played. I do not often play online as it is normally young boys simply shooting each other....not my cup of tea; and while GTA V doesn't lack for those idiots, Rockstar has both made it easy to avoid the them as well make most play either solo or co-op....really fun sandbox even if it eats up an amazing amount of internet usage (if you have a cap) and is an incredible grind if you want the level 100 Achievement....you are forced to grind races mainly.\r I assume the reason that GTA is so popular is that the game was very accessible, meaning the single player lacks any real challenge as the game is expert i handholding and making difficult seeming encounters very easy. This can be both a plus (for casuals) and a minus (most serious gamers).\r The detailed open world is a pleasure to play in; as with all open worlds it is not perfect by a long shot, but it is hands down the best out there....Far Cry 3 would be the closest.\r Cons\rYou are forced to play as 3 degenerate murderers....I find this an odd concept. You can spin it however you want, but all 3 are idiots.....how is one supposed to feel immersed playing these tools?\r The single player is far, far too easy.\r Traffic is supposed to mimic reality and yet the sole purpose of traffic in GTA V is to create obstacles for you as a driver.....it's idiotic.\r Default vehicles...each character has them, but no mater how much money you make you can never change your default vehicle.....very simple but massive fail.","Meets all my expectations and included way more than I expected. Probably the best game I have played since Saints Row 2. The characters have deep and vibrant backgrounds and the gameplay is to die for.","Best game of 2013 has gotten even more better than ever. Thanks to First Person and many graphical improvements, this game is simply the most immersive Grand Theft Auto I've ever played. It might have the same name, but it's a completely different experience.","From The Addition Of Animals To Actually Being Able To Play As One. The Game Has A Lot To Offer. I Am Certain That There Is New Content Yet To Be Discovered In The Game. For Xbox One Owners, This Is The Definitive Version.","Amazing.\rGraphically I'd say it's at it's best with it's higher resolution, and faster frame rate. The traffic is little denser, however it could be better, they went on, and about saying it would be like midnight club, but it's not. The wildlife is crazy. There are so much more new wild life in it. The map is more detailed, it has actual grass, flowers, lights on the sites look more real, the drawn distance is more greater, and sharper. The loading times are better, and GTA online isn't really that all buggy anymore.  Rockstar did a really good job, and I'm proud of them, however don't listen to the fanboys telling you to get on different consoles, it all depends on your taste.","I have owned both the previous versions on Xbox 360 and PS3, and I have to say that they managed to make one of the best games of all time even better.\rPros:\r- Significantly improved and stable frame-rate\r- First person mode (changes the entire way you play the game)\r- Higher resolution\r- Driving acceleration torque control is similar to that of Forza Horizon\r- Lots of added bonus features and free $1,000,000 for in game use.\r What is there more to say? Can't wait for the PC version.","An even better version of an amazing game. The graphics are way better, the textures of the clothes especially in GTA Online are by far better, good character editor, better overall feeling. Its just a game you should have played.","GTA V is the cream of the crop of the series. It provides us with a excellent story, colorful visuals, great graphics and a real sense of realism that was not found in the other games. It is truly on one of the best games ever made. It truly takes the top of the tower. Rockstar's elegantly created Los Santos is something, you shouldn't miss out on. Truly a spectacular sight.","This game didn't need much improving for mE, I aleeady thought it was brilliant but the effort they have put into the first person mode shows the effort rockstar put in, this game is a improvement on a already fantastic game","So the day has come, Grand Theft Auto 5 has released on PS4 and Xbox One and it's even better then it's last gen counterpart. All the typical upgrades are there Graphics,Bigger lobbies and all kinds of little details that will keep surprising you. One of and maybe the biggest upgrade is the addition of a First Person Mode, this adds a whole new layer to the game and makes you feel like the actions of your character are done by you and not a character in a video game.\rThe addition of new Vehicles,Guns and Songs also keeps you interested if you already played hours of GTA5 on PS3/360.\rGrand Theft Auto Online on the other hand has been difficult and frustrating, lots of time spent in loading screens and disconnecting from friends/Jobs. Many people have been unable to even play GTA:Online and the methods of fixing the problem is well over the head of an average gamer and need to be address by Rockstar.\rAltogether GTA 5 is just as good when it was on last gen, put aside the technical issues that hopefully are fixed soon and you have an extremely fun and enjoyable game.","The game is great for following the old school tradition of the GTA game line but online multiplayer is in the ditch. I have bought a half dozen or so disks to play with family spread throughout the country over the last six months. What a waste of money! We can't play a single session without one of us being kicked off the server. That is if we are lucky enough to even get on a session!. Half of the missions that we start will end abruptly or the cops will interrupt due to the glitches in their system. Game saves are a joke. Most of the time rock-star servers are temporarily out of service. The system admin will say in their trouble shooting guide that it is your internet speeds or something to totally pass the buck, but running the tests confirming you have double their speed requirements and opening modem settings do nothing to resolve the fact that its their platform that is a piece of crap. My advice? Save your money if you want to play online with family! They charge way more than is necessary for in game cash and then you can't consistently even play the game without session hopping.","grand theft auto five is a okay game it is not my personal favorite. i don't feel it is worth fifty pounds the online was a disappointment  i feel after spending five years on a game it could of been much better than it was. the story line was good i enjoyed playing it i feel having three playable characters was a good ideas therefore i feel it was overall a goodish game.","First off back when this game released last year on ps3/360 I thought it was the best game I have ever played, now one year later it is still the best game I have ever played. What Rockstar does that other game developers don't is make sure every little detail is polished to deliver a great gaming experience, and with this re launch they decided just having better graphics was not enough. New this time around is first person mode, weather, traffic, vehicles, songs, etc and with the game totalling at 45 GB there's definitely a lot to do. Xbox one version runs well with the odd stutter here and there but very playable, I am sure the PC version will blow the doors off any game currently on the market graphics wise.","This is very mediocre game and I can see now why it's rated very high - garbage for the mindless masses. As the movie would work great and because of the story (cut scenes)  I kept playing. As the gameplay, it fails to deliver. Gameplay is mostly boring, repetitive and very easy. It may appeal to very casual play or if you want to play it \"impaired\" - it simply does not require to use higher brain functions.\r I apologize for being brutally honest - I really wanted to like this game, to see what others are raving about, however I would fall asleep if it wasn't for the story. I praise movement and driving mechanics. Overall: not recommended.","Load times and slow gameplay ruin this game. Not to mention zero single player dlc for what was not the best single player gta experience. Online mode is a pure money grab via micro transactions, Everything they release in the so called DLC's is overpriced in an obvious attempt to sell a few shark cards. This game could of been so much better. Anyone that rates this game 10/10 is either on the take or brainwashed. Gaming really has went downhill in recent years.","What is this? really dissapointing... where is CJ? what happened to the Groves? Multiverses? bullsh*t !\rBad physics, boring history... man, why they did that to Johnny K? UFOs? Monkeys? man...\rwhy rockstar did this? worst game of Rockstar, really, i rather gta III","Removing mods is the worst. Literally unplayable. So much hate coming their way now. They took a beloved game and absolutely ruined it by banning mods.","The Grand Theft Auto series has made leap and bounds in creating immersive gaming experiences. The series has recreated and refined open world games along the way. This addiction to the series is no exception as it has a huge open world and crazy antics throughout.\rThis game is one of the most beautiful games to come out of 2014, especially with the updated graphics from the previous Xbox 360 and PS3 variation. It is aided by a huge but finely detailed map. From an airport to a dessert, this map has all the space and things you need to have a great time and keep the game interesting but also leave enough space and options for future amazing dlc.\rThere are two clear modes in this game, the story mode which has 3 main characters and the online mode. This unique game is heavily aided by the story mode, which has 3 main characters which gives the gamer 3 different views and experiences throughout. Each character have their flaws and benefits which helps to make gameplay like nothing else. There are a whole host of action packed and unpredictable missions that will have you entertained for hours. There are also a number of heists that need setting up and executing throughout the game. Overall, the story mode is great but has not received any new dlc for a few years now.\rThe second mode is the chaotic competitive multiplayer mode. This allows gamers to play together ultimately destroy one another with expansive range of explosives and guns available in the game. On the other hand there is also a passive mode which allows the player to not get killed. There is also a wide variety of vehicles including jets, boats, submarine, planes and cars, which have been added in recent DLC and many more are to come from this game. Fun and creative missions are also available to earn money, as well as heists to fund your free roam antics.\rThe DLC is a bit controversial, the items being added are what everyone wants, but the price of these items in game and also in real life are extremely expensive. For example, if you want to by a hangar with all the upgrades and the most expensive plane in the game with all the upgrades also it will cost you over \u00a3100 in real money for two items, that\u2019s crazy. This is also a great business model, but it\u2019s getting ridiculous as it is turning into a pay to win game, which becomes boring as you\u2019ve got to play missions over and over again to earn money, but still not get enough money to buy a single DLC item. Originally when the game came out the items were all reasonably priced so shark card were a good option that get plenty for your money. They have expanded this game greatly adding new experiences and whole new meaning to crazy but if only it was affordable\rCompared to other games this has a huge open map that many games do not offer. What stands out with this game is that nothing is impossible in this game, literally anything can happen, which why it is still one of the most played games 4 years after its original release in 2013 followed by this version later on.\rOverall, in my opinion this game is ground breaking and is going to age well and has aged well in fact but there is one significant problem with it; the new items are overpriced and take a lot to grind them out which is very repetitive and ultimately people like lose interest as they put in a lot of effort with very minimal rewards if any. This game is going to be an all-time classic and I don\u2019t see it going anywhere anytime soon, as it is one of the greatest games I have ever played.","Beautiful graphics and a wonderful engine and open world.\rBut what about the story, game play and characters.\rIts so outdated and boring.\rIt's so stereotype I'm falling asleep.\rWhat happened to the ladies in the first GTA for example?\r Please use your great game and engine and make something exciting and new!\rPlease!\rIt's like nintendo all over. Just the same game over and over.\rSo dissapointed.","Like most of you, i've played this game before on Xbox 360, and loved the story, and everything you can do in this (for its time) huge map. The videos Rockstar released before the game came out, showed more people on the roads and sidewalks, Denser foliage, and generally cleaner graphics than the Xbox 360 could handle, but none the less, for a last generation game, especially if you compare this game to GTA IV, was still a impressive game none the less.\r now, a little over a year on, we get the full HD treatment, with full streets and roads, just like the video's, and those commercial signs alongside the road are readable far far away. Most impressive is when you take the chopper, and fly above the city. You'll notice the cars are still on the road when you are high, the detail on the ground is nothing short of amazing, and so far, i have only been talking about the graphical changes made to the game. But there's more: New camera modes, like the FPS look, are added, the game play feels more \"rounded\", especially when you drive the lots of different (and also a few NEW) cars, this game looks and feels more polished, making this a instant buy for me.\r The biggest surprise was how much cleaner the audio sounds, especially the music on the radio! I play trough a 5.1 THX set, and the improvement in sound is just as big as the graphical one. Cars sound have more body and power, the surround effect works great, especially when you walk around mount chiliad (i don't know if this is spelled correct), and you hear a crying wolf just behind you. Priceless!\r So for me, after playing a few remakes of other games, this may be the best HD makeover i've played. Sure, you've played this before, but if you are like me (re playing the story 3 times or more on previous generation game) and you enjoy movies and games more than just once or twice, it's worth even only if the single player mode was improved, but there's more: Multiplayer has more players at the same time on the map, and most importantly (at least for me), you can transfer all your belongings you earned on the older generation versions to this game! It does not even matter if you go from Xbox 360 to Playstation 4, or from Playstation 3 to Xbox One! All you need to have is first create/connect your old generation game to Rockstar Social Club, and then boot up the new generation version, and go for character transfer. So in short, you can trade in your old version (AFTER connecting it with Rockstar's Social Club), so you won't pay full price! I had a nice 20\u20ac discount, so that's nice.\r Have no doubt, if you liked the previous generation game, you will going to LOVE this one. A 10 is out of order because of just two small reasons: I played this before, and if you are a early adaptor, transfer your online character takes a long time because of busy servers, but this has been solved already, so no fear, this wil go smoothly now.","Well, they've done it again. Rockstar have yet again, came up and in my opinion have won GOTY...only thing is, they've managed to do it with the same game.\r The additional objectives, the seamless ability to get online and the 1st person are all examples of a game company who put their customers 1st. There isnt one aspect of the game I would fault. It is a complete all rounder. Ive been playing games since day dot and I can honestly put my hand on my heart and say this is by far the best game in history.","Amazing graphic, great storyline, I love this game! This game could also use some expansion, like a new island, more apartment can be able to be purchased at GTA Online, etc..","The amount of things to do and see in this game is insane. Endless possibilities. The shooting mechanics and overallcontrolls aren't my favorite, but that can't take away from the great gameplay and mission design.","With the addition of first person mode, new easter eggs and new missions and weapons, the next gen version of GTA 5 steps it up another notch making an already made masterpiece that much more better! (if that is at all possible!)","This game is beautiful.\rAbsolutely worth the price of admission.\rThe first person mode is a great addition.\rThe amount of detail put into this HD remake is intense.","GTA V is a solid game with great gameplay, great graphics and a good story-you play as three characters Michael, Trevor and Franklin. You have to sort out gangs, holdup stores and hijack military jets. What more do you want from a game?","It is by far the best Grand Theft Auto game in the profitable series. That is saying something considering I thought San Andreas was amazing. The game play, graphics, open-world options, customization options, and overall interaction opportunities make it an easy 10/10. However, do not listen to me, see for yourself!","Alert, alert! The Overrated Army has found an overrated game. The fraudulent culprit of today is Grand Theft Auto V. As such, we will give it the lowest score possible as punishment.\rThanks for your understanding. -TheOverratedArmyTeam","i tried with this game i really did,but by Christ it bores me,i honestly cannot play it without falling asleep.\rhaving avoided it on last gen consoles,i was intending to get it on pc,but opted for xbox one for ease of experience.\r the main problem is its tedious,overly complicated controls for what should be simple and enjoyable.\r one early mission where your to shoot somebody from a moving car requests you to be very highly dexterous to silly levels.\ri understand all the silly mini-games are there to make it more involving and such-but its a distraction from the proper game and feels like nothing but filler.not real seeing any improvements in graphics but then maybe my tv is just too small.\r far too much aimless wandering about.\ri really really dont understand how this gets so many rave reviews,i much prefer watch dogs .","I have never been a GTA fan but must admit that I really enjoyed playing this one. World is beautiful and alive and has practically everything in it. I could easily say from objective view that this is the best game ever made. From my own subjective view I would like to have more action and shooting. What kept me from giving it 10/10 is the Online experience. Long load times there are painful.","this game has everything. big world. integrated  missions secondaries , races, weapons, mountains, fighters, tanks, smarter pedestrians, clothes, accessories. stations, all functional they do see more real and exciting. what makes this game more than any level is the on line mode, although with several graphical flaws and requirement an excellent Internet connection, is right assign the highest score.","The xbox One version of this game is essentially the Xbox 360 version scaled-up with some touch ups and improvements, For someone to buy this game for the first time I definitely reccomend purchasing it, but if you have bought it before on a previous gen you're not missing out on too much.\rThe online seems to have some issues with connectivity, and overall game play, it is pretty much a sad micro transaction grab online.\r If you're buying it for the first time, a definite 10, but if you're considering buying again on xbox one, I would give it a 8/10 recommendation, as there was not enough added to make it really worth 60$.\r I feel as if Rockstar could have done a lot more in terms of gameplay.","I really don't understand what the fuss is about this game. The mechanics player movement and driving are terrible. The Mechanics don't even come close to being as good as other 3rd person games like Tomb Raider, Splinter Cell, Shadow of Mordor, Dead Space.\rIs it a hit because you get to be as bad as your evil heart desires?\rI get to go to a strip club and get thrown out or smoke something that gives me a bad trip or be a thug. Is this what gamers love? Pathetic really\rYet critics praise this trash","i have not played it on the xbox one yet but this game is perfect on the xbox360. when iplayed it on the 360 i was like wow.  it is going to be more than perfect on the xbox one","What the heck is wrong with GTA V? It has the longest load times ever. EVER. EVER. EVER. The campaign takes 4-6 minutes to load. Maybe longer. I stopped checking my watch. But I guess Rockstar felt that wasn\u2019t long enough. The online component is worse. The load times are nearly long enough for me to have a pizza delivered to my home. But wait, it\u2019s worse than that. The game constantly disconnects from the servers. So now I gotta either wait another lunar month for the GTA V online to load, or throw it out the window. I chose the latter.\r The load times between individual online missions are so long, that the first time I played, I thought my Xbox froze. It\u2019s frustrating. It\u2019s garbage. It\u2019s an absolute joke. And I don\u2019t understand this because Max Payne 3 is pretty darn good.\r I\u2019ll be the first to say that GTA V\u2019s load times make it one of the worst gaming experiences of recent memory. I don\u2019t plan on providing a full review, because I don\u2019t want to spend 20 minutes of every hour waiting for crap to load. But my first impression of the game is this: It\u2019s overrated and boring. I enjoyed GTA back in the PS2 days.\r Foremost, the controls are confusing. Sometimes players have to press \u201cX\u201d to open a door. Other times they have to press left on the D-pad. Huh? This explains the need for constant on screen prompts. For the longest time I couldn\u2019t remember how to sit on a couch. Sounds funny but this shouldn\u2019t happen to gamers. GTA V needs better controls. It needs predictable, consistent controls. As they are now the controls suck.\r Navigating the map is cumbersome. To access the map, I have to open the menus, then select the map so I can view it. Putting extra steps between players and the map is a bad idea.\rAiming is terrible. Even during its early missions, GTA\u2019s flawed gun mechanics were already pissing me off. Shooting while driving is a disaster. Players must use 5 buttons simultaneously to control their cars and shoot. It\u2019s a complete spectacle that I don\u2019t have the patience to endure.\r GTA V\u2019s driving experience is merely average. All engines sound anemic. Cars handle OK. For a series entitled Grand Theft Auto, I expected the \u201cAuto\u201d part to rock. But it doesn\u2019t. I can name plenty of other games that rival and even surpass GTA V in that department.\r All its problems point to fundamental quality oversights. A series this old shouldn\u2019t suffer from freshman flaws. At its core, GTA V is an average game. Sure, GTA\u2019s world has gotten bigger. But the controls suck. Driving is mediocre. Gunplay is just plain awful. And the multiplayer is broken. Rockstar\u2019s developers have been handed too much credit. But gamers eagerly lap it up so they can live out their law breaking, sex-crazed, gun totting, raunchy fantasies. It\u2019s that simple. Who cares if nothing else works so long as horny gamers can experience horribly animated prostitutes laughably simulating fellatio.\r Having not played a GTA game in nearly a decade, I can unreservedly say that I\u2019m not impressed. Despite all the crap kicked at Watch Dogs, it\u2019s a superior game. Watch dogs has better mechanics. Better visuals. Better story. Heck, even the driving is better. There is constantly stuff to do and NPC\u2019s are definitely more lifelike. I\u2019ll pass on GTA V. I\u2019d rather play Watch Dogs, Saints Row, Just Cause 2, or the exquisite Forza 4.\r GTA V is the culmination of franchise fatigue, wrong priorities, and horrible optimization. The high marks are not merited. It just shows that critics and gamers alike will always have their favorite games and challengers will be criticized for the very flaws that are ignored in those favorites.","Didn't bother with this on the 360 and waited for the Xbox one version to arrive. My god, all the hype around this game, the near perfect scores...I just don't see it. Maybe for the last gen, but really, this game does not look that visually great. It's an example of where 1080 does not mean a better looking game. Obviously, there is masses to do in this game and the map is huge, but seriously, I had forgot what a crappy experience driving was in GTA games, and wow it's just as crappy here. the rendering of animals is awful, and frame rate stutter is obvious. So for content its a 9/10 for playability (clunky) and visuals its a 5/10 so overall 7/10 for me. Definitely not a next gen game, with its feet clearly cemented in the last gen.","Not a single fault in this game.  Beautiful world, well written characters and dialogue, fantastic story, gameplay, graphics, pacing, etc.  This game is a masterpiece and the best Rockstar Game I've ever played.","A 10/10 game for sure. Just read the other 10/10 user reviews. I don't have to repeat what they have said about the game. I will add one thing ...\r ... and that is the shooting FP mechanic. This can be improved. This must be improved by Rockstar. I know it is their first outing with FP view, but it simply plays less smooth than CoD, BF or FarCry. Especially the aiming. In CoD, BF, FC I have never problem to put the dot on the head, but in GTAV it is a major pain. I don't know why. I'd say, hire some guy from those other games, copy/paste some controller coding and hey presto, you've got your shooting mechanics like CoD/BF/FC\r So ... there is something to improve on this already 10/10 game.\r Don't be bothered by my 'negative' above. Just play and enjoy this game like I do. Both last year on 360 and now, gloriously upgraded on Xbox One:)","With significant improvements graphically and musically,as well as dozens of subtle changes and upgrades,GTA V remains a true masterpiece of gaming.Simply walking,running,flying,swimming and driving around absorbing the fantastic atmosphere is one of the great joys of this video game.","This game really needs to get out of it's own way.  Both the story mode and online mode require you to fit into Rockstar's predetermined box that it really interferes with the game's enjoyability.  Behind that though, the targeting is much improved, the characters are very strong, decent dialog, and the racing missions might be some of the most fun in the game - the race mechanics really are that good.  In the end the obsession with unlocking things makes what would be really fun into something extremely tedious, I already beat the story mission do I really have to unlock all the guns in online mode . . . again?  Why do I have to unlock the ability to upgrade my car?  What if I want to have an AI match because no other person online wants to play the matches I want to play?  This game doesn't have the droves of followers that Call of Duty and their ilk have, probably never will, and most importantly the players are different.  Why make this game into Battle field or CoD, if I wanted to play those games I'd just load them up.  GTA 5 can't compete in the same field because it's not the same type of game, give up, let GTA be awesome by itself and stop trying to press it into the mold of the one hit wonders!","Of course this game is absolutely impressive in terms of production value and setting. The city is incredibly well done and rich in detail. The game feels massive.\rI did not like the way the story was made, it feels like it is unspoilable, wih nothig significant happening, no twists, dramatic turn of events of any surprises or suspension. Its more like 3 friends doing random jobs and adventures in a city, with no visible direction. Not my kind of thing. I will probaby not remember the game for long. In its soul the game is a 8, but its impressive production gives it a 9.","This game is awesome, anyone who's a gta fan needs to pick it up\rStory may not be as good as San Andreas or 4 imo, but this game is near perfect in its own right. It also has the best open world of this whole generation","Nuisances, over nuisances, over NUISANCES. It's like they designed the game to make you upset. You drive too close to the other lane? A car coming from the opposite direction \"panics\" and invades your lane, crashing against you. You were going slow, but you flew out of the car anyway, because it looks like being thrown out of a car is matter of chance unrelated to your speed, so the incident looks completely forced and unnatural. This is just an example when I talk about nuisances. There are cars that suddenly change lane making impossible turns, there are police cars spawning in your way, there are sidewalks that make you trip if you are on a motorcycle, there are cars invading your lane hidden behind a corner and many other things that force you to drive slowly. They made it so you can't drive at full speed IN A **** GTA. There is ALWAYS something that gets conveniently in your way to stop you. Is this suppose to be realistic? Because it's not, all those nuisances look forced as **** Of course, most of the time you don't die and you lose some armor (armor is just extra health like in the previous titles, and I didn't like that back then and I don't like it now). You want to restore the armor? You have to found one in the world, because if you go to Ammunation without suffering enough damage, the game doesn't allow you to buy a new armor.\r Singleplayer is balanced like multiplayer: if your characters have \"too much money\", all the random events disappear, and you find yourself playing in a dead sand box.\r The story is shallow and not too long, it's under the 20hrs. Endings look all kinda empty and inconclusive. You can replay them to get medals, but that's too is annoying as **** You have to complete missions under a time limit, or you have to race against NPCs that are unstoppable like trains without damaging your car, you have to avoid taking damage, and on. They make the already annoying gameplay in a more annoying experience.\r The game is quite short for a sandbox. What did Rockstar did to expand the longevity? They put collectibles. HUNDREDS  of them. They abused the cheapiest way to make a game last longer.\r The multiplayer is the worst I have ever seen. You are thrown in a public session. If there are more than ten players in your session, within ten minutes you are dropped. It's not your connection, it's their **** servers. You are dropped even if the session is private, of course. You want to race? Good luck finding more than 4 players to race with: the lobby system doesn't wait for you to find more people.\r tl;dr: This game was really a step back from GTAIV. Full of nuisances and collectibles, unremarkable story, less little details (search on youtube \"GTA IV is better that GTA V to have an idea of what I'm talking about), the **** multiplayer and other things that may look small, but add up. It took me a lot of time for me to finish it (without collectibles, **** those things), because every half a hour I found myself thinking \"WTF is this **** I'm out\" and dropped the game for days.\r ---&gt;5/10, THE GAME WASN'T MADE TO BE FUN.","Grand Theft Auto V is not a game, it's an experience, this game feels so real with its characters, atmosphere, and gameplay, despite the story being a little bland.","In my opinion, quite simply one of the best games ever made. Easily 2013's best game. The world is alive, the story and the telling from 3 perspectives is great. Cars handle well, weapons handle well, missions have variation and humor. If you loved a GTA in the past, get ready to fall in love again.","fun game for the most part except for the typical online cheaters as always in every game... cops are annoying in this game and the people are plain out just retarded lmao. I wish all the cars had speedmonitors in them (how ever its spelt and called to see how fast you are going)  other then that I enjoy playing the missions over and over again because Trevor just flat out makes me laugh. cheers","This game is perfect, there's nothing bad apart from they don't update GTA Online enough. The story was brilliant and I did not expect them to put much effort into it but they did! the graphics compared to Old Gen are like a whole different game.","The core of the game for me is 10/10. The story, graphics, controls, sound is all remarkable. It was one of the my memorable gaming experiences. Everything felt so polished and refined. The introduction of 3 characters to live through was a fantastic idea and really allows you to dive in deeper with customization.\r Then came GTA online... and significantly impacted my final score. Words cannot describe my frustration trying to play it. It's an absolute piece of turd. Imagine a Ferrari, and everything on it is perfect, except the rear bumper is made out of play-doh. The loading times are astonishingly long, and if you're lucky to be connected you have anywhere between 10 minutes to 30 minutes before the server hands your ass to you out the door. I went through EVERY imaginable method described by Rockstar support to get this to work, and they kept saying it was on my end. Meanwhile I'm reading everywhere else people having the same issue. They asked for screenshots of all my settings and they finally admitted the problem wasn't on my end, and upgraded my support ticket which I never heard from again.\r You would think that Rockstar, with this mountain of cash they made, would invest in a good networking system. Right? What's interesting is, they promptly delete complaints off their forums about these problems. I have friends who are trying to play with the exact same issues.\r VERY disappointing.","Great Game. The best GTA now enhanced by the Xbox One is a delight to play. Given that the Original GTAV was close to a 10/10 imo, this version just finalises any doubts in my mind.\r I am very surprised that upon playing 6+ Hours of the game already the framerate was indeed very smooth. Great job by Rockstar, their game developers obviously know how to code video games before release\u2026","The remastered version was not as good as I would have hoped, but it's still an awesome game and worth the money if you haven't played it before, or if you never purchased DLC (you get all DLC for free if you transfer from 360 to One).\r If you haven't played GTA before, then you are in for a treat. This is probably one of the best storylines to ever be implemented in a video game. It's well worth its higher-than-average rating.","I saw all the positive reviews of this game and i kinda agree with the reviews, this is my review  of GTA Online and here is my reception. This game has some of the longest loadtimes on next gen and yes this is on xbox one, it takes like 50 secs or 1 min to join a online session and...After long wait you joining an empty session or get timed out, my internet is fine NAT is open, everything is fine. Oh btw u getting lagged out of the session too easy, when u get out of ur garage it complet lagging when u driving even if ur internet is good, but yea Online is still fun.","PROS\r-Excellent Graphics\r-catchy story\r-fun online\r-smooth gameplay\r CONS\r-Extremely long load times    .","The game is really awesome, but I gave it only 7 because of the short time you can stay in the live session without kicking you out is just too short!","I'd give it a 7.5, but since I can't, I'll be nice to give it an 8! Its great to play again and what not, but it feels like it was a cheap remaster, like GTA SA for XBOX 360. I don't like rockstar's recent attitude, and its getting annoying! The game is great, but it feels like an \"average remaster\". That's not what I except from Rockstar, and heists which where promised a YEAR AGO aren't out yet! Its a great game, but rockstar is acting arrogant, I remember they told us it'd be the best thing ever blah blah blah! Its a good game, but not a great one! No one can say this is unfair, since people know its true! Rockstar's quality on games is down! Now I'll repeat it again, it's a good game! But if you already have the last gen one, don't buy it unless your interested in the soundtrack and fps mode, otherwise last gen looked just fine! Oh and one more thing to add, this score isn't for the online mode, these days so many games have this problem, I don't deduct points for online gaming problem.","everything is GROSSLY priced in their in game economy in favor of the m0rons that buy shark cards and induce this kind of lame gaming.  If there weren't shark cards I'm sure everything in game (cars,planes,weapons,etc) would be priced reasonably and obtainable without either having to grind until your fingers fall off or you fork over $100 usd for 5 digital vehicles.  As it stands they remove cool concepts from development (casino) and repeatedly nerf the best ways gamers use to obtain in game currency.  This game is trash, rockstar is trash, F red dead redemption 2 (and I wanted to check that out and may still USED off EBAY so they do not get anymore money directly from me).  Rockstar makes me want the gaming industry to crash and burn...die you greedy ********!","A little over hyped to say the least, but still an amazing overall game. Huge, wide and diverse map as you make your way through the GTA world surrounding you. Great detail in nature and cars, but Rocksteady fails to deliver its long promised heists mode that many people purchased the game for in the first place. Story is solid, but gameplay lacks certain things to make this game near to perfection. With that still said, it is a major upgrade from the last game in the GTA series.","Honestly, I can't believe this game is still on top of the overall reviews, score wise at least. It's fun at first, compared to the repetitive world of GTA but that wears off relatively quickly. It turns into a one track game much like every other GTA, about three missions in. I will say it looks nice, but that's about the kindest thing I can say of it. The story is blah, the characters outside of Trevor (Trevor is freakin hilarious) are meh, the online play doesn't offer anything worth mentioning. Just a very under whelming game that is better to rent than to actually buy.","i mean like every **** game have to be like this this is the best game i have ever played and i will four ever play this master peace and i wish rockstar will have a another one of this game and i wish it will keep going until the end","This an awesome game and the best till today.I am fascinated by this for it's features,graphics and gaming expierience on XBOX One.The interactive World is too big to get bored of.\r SD","GTA V is still an amazing game, but framerate during intense moments bring it down. Also, certain parts in the story make me think \"what were the devs thinking?!?\"","Still a great game but released too late on xbone. Heists delayed way too long. I'm sure rokstar had to delay but too late. Slight improvements aren't enough to upgrade from 360.","GTA has always been about the casual market making the mechanics very easy. The story is good and the open world is beautifull but the thing is that the gameplay feels repetitive as hell. the online makes u farm xp in order to max all of the stats. there is a big gap between the low level players and the high ones. what is this an MMORPG? no. over all the game (as a technical aspect) is very well made, but the gameplay is the thing i look into a videogame. it gets a 6 because of the boring gameplay","Have always loved the GTA series and for me it just keeps getting better and better. I would love the story line to be longer and maybe online to have an option to choose who you are online with e.g. players who want to do certain types of missions or players who just want to be online to fight other players etc","Playability: Simple and fairly smooth. Driving has improved a lot since GTAIV. Aiming can feel awkward at\rtimes.\rStory: Excellent! This is easily my favorite part of this game. There's lots of creativity here with tons of\rtwists and great humor. I never got bored.\rGraphics: Runs very smooth on XB1 with lots of detail. The city really lights up after dark.\rSound: Everything in game sounds fine. If you can't find a radio station you like, music probably isn't for\ryou.\rMultiplayer: Not bad when it works. Loading and connecting with friends can be slow and frustrating.","Me lo he pasado entero y se me ha hecho pesado,demasiadas misiones de relleno y un co\u00f1azo el tener que cambiar de personaje cada dos por tres(no me parece que este muy bien hecho).La historia tirando a mala y muy automatico todo en la jugabilidad...el modo online he jugado pero vamos....te tiene que gustar mucho el juego para pillarle el gusto y el nivel necesario para jugar ahi.","I don't have to write a long review for this one, because it is simply one of the greatest video games ever made... the amount of time and effort that went into this game is astounding","GTA \u00e9 GTA, n\u00e3o tem outra forma de definir o game. GTA V no Xbox One volta com v\u00e1rias atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es e novos momentos marcantes que nos repassam a mesma emo\u00e7\u00e3o de ser in\u00e9dito. Com um gr\u00e1fico \u00f3timo e muitos momentos marcantes GTA V voltou com tudo e merece ser rejogado.","This game was a 10 until they released flying bikes and made me stop playing. Solo story is great as you would expect from any rockstar game but online mode is even more enjoyable with many more missions all soloable but the most enjoyable part are the heists, only problem here is you will need friends or join a bunch a randoms and hope for the best.","Goty 2013, goty for the best remastering 2014 and best-selling game on ps3, ps4, 360 and one. and everything is little for the game of the generation. Steam is always one of the most played games and the first ones are free games. It has sold more than 140 million games and has been shown to be of higher quality than 2020 games that are coming to revolutionize the industry.\r It is the most infra-flying game, I simply want to believe because of its popularity and to be the game that has surpassed the exclusives of such a console and some cannot bear it and for that they hate it\r The remastering of the game brought many new features such as some aviation missions, or secondary missions, races, many more new cars, a variety of cars and pedestrians on the streets, greater drawing distance, better textures, fov, new weapons,, more animals, peyotes, and first-person highlights and better made than first person only games of 2020.\r It has three stories in one, masterfully mixed, each character is for each type of player in the saga.\r The story is much more complicated, convoluted and better explained than what people usually see. People are only left with the action and the swearing but it is much more than that. The characters are well crafted and are deeper and have more personality than other games of the time. Michael is divided in his life and what he wants from it, Franklin is a worse person than he seems and Trevor is more friendly and aware of who he is than the other two. Everything you ask yourself playing the game is told in the story, how they met, why they are like this ... The heist missions are new and they have two options with their preparatory missions and apart is the saga game with the most missions varied, fun and long. It's a shame that people don't take the story seriously because it\u00b4s the top 3 of its generation.\r The secondary characters are very good, not at the level of gta iv but the closest ones have personality to have had their own dlc.\r The city is incredible, with city and countryside as many asked after gta iv, it feels alive and is full of curiosities, you can see even the curve of the earth when flying and the bottom of the sea is explorable. Again full of details like all R * games.\r There are also those who complain that there is nothing to do behind the story, something totally false. You can hunt, buy businesses and their missions, secondary missions, random characters, aviation test, base jump, shooting range, cinema, shopping for clothes, cars, tune cars, tune weapons, triathlons, etc.\r The graphics are the top of its generation considering that it is open world and the amount of things it has such as the ocean, the big map, physics, i.a. objects on screen ... and even being open world it is graphically above linear games\r The b.s.o. It is huge and with songs of all styles, the largest and most varied in the saga and far ahead of other open world games with similar themes. The songs created for the game and its missions are also very good and typical of action movies, playing in game situations adding tension and epicity.\r The gameplay is an evolution in the saga, now shoot, take cover, shoot without looking out, drive ... everything is different from gta iv. Some may think that it is better or worse but at least it is not a copy and paste and for 2013 it defends itself very well today\r After eight years and everything that has been achieved who denies that it is the game of the generation is lying to himself. Gta v is on another level, it took ps3 and 360 to the limit and it only remains to say thank you Rockstar","This game features unlikeable character, unworkable shooting, clunky driving mechanics, and confusing quest mechanics. I believe the reason I disliked this game so much is that I played Watch Dogs which, while not perfect, is better in every conceivable way. 1 out of 10 for the box art.","So much fun to be had here. What a treat! Just ridiculous. Solid story to kick off this crazy ride.","Qu\u00e9 decir de una entrega de tan famosa saga que a d\u00eda de hoy se sigue actualizando con m\u00e1s contenido online. Sumado a una campa\u00f1a llena de emoci\u00f3n e inter\u00e9s y muchas novedades acompa\u00f1ando a un tr\u00edo de protagonistas tan carism\u00e1ticos, quiz\u00e1 podr\u00edamos estar ante el mejor GTA de todos. Y eso es mucho decir.","GTA often has a fun little world to play in, but the controls have always sucked, the loading is abysmal, &amp; getting from the boring main game over to the Online mode is a chore.It's a sandbox for morons, &amp; there are more idiots in the world than any others, hence the popularity.If you have an I.Q. over 75, this game will frustrate, &amp; bore you","GTA 5 has very beautiful graphics specially in the grasslands of mount chilled. The characters are very unique from each other and have different skill sets which leads to different performances. However, the story is not quite good and uninteresting. The missions you do as a group is fun for the first time but it gets repetitive as they use the same context again and again. Overall its a great with lots of fun but an uninteresting story.","I brought Grand Theft Auto 5 for \u00a355 pound on xbox one its a sick game im a big gta fam the best thing about this games is the graphic,cars,and the mission the bad things about this is that rockstar need to bring the heist out because they being saying this for 1 year now and they haven't done nothing about it another this is that the game gliches like the cars go under the map but i like the game i would recommed people to buy it","Fantastic world, awe inspiring world. Terrific story. The single player is fairly flawless. The world is massive and you can do just about anything you could imagine. Fun online but definitely still very unfinished.","I\u2019ve finally decided to stop being a stupid and stubborn **** about it and now that I\u2019ve played I\u2019m going to be more fair now, grand theft auto is a very fun expierience with awesome gameplay top notch graphics and surprisingly in depth open world, I\u2019m happy I finally got it and I\u2019m happy to say that any negative things I\u2019ve said before were dead wrong, while I still don\u2019t think the characters or the story were the greatest, I can\u2019t call them bad they are there for a reason and the story wouldn\u2019t be what it was without them. If you want to get it, I say do it but I\u2019m sure you guys have probably already done that.","Very good game from me i love this type of game S2\reu sou um brasileiro e para todos os Br que estao vendo aqui eu falo que aprovo esse game por ser um dos melhores de todos ate agora na minha opniao a unica desvantagem e que o jogo e meio caro","GTA 5 has improved a lot compared to the previous games. Improved gameplay, a good story mode, and an amazing open world. The new first-person perspective for only the next-gen consoles is really awesome. You get to experience the whole game in a new way. The online may need some work but the game overall is amazing","Great game by Rock Star as always a true jolt of fun and very interactive story peppered with characters with depth and motivations. Also with it GTA Online that is like a whole different game that you can sink hundreds of hours into.

Even if it means a double dip, you should buy the game.","an utter masterpiece.  I have about 25 days just on the ONLINE game.  Playing with friends could not be more fun yet at the same time I can have fun alone.  Avoiding gangs and the police is always fun, i find myself playing for countless hours just driving around in the massive world.  It was hard to even complete the story mode because I would always get distracted with the fun random events or the side missions.  Overall, one of the best games I have ever put my time in.  10/10 if i could put 11/10 i would.","Nobody can hate this game because there is enough to do for everyone. You like side missions they have that.... You like multiplayer they have that....... You like free playing around and doing what you want they have that....... There is no way you can be negative about this game even if you try. The game has no problems at all!!!","The new and improved graphics is just the icing on the cake for what is GTA V, Rockstar's best game yet. The intertwining storyline of the three protagonists is brilliantly thought out, well-written, and brilliantly conceived. There is simply so much to do when you are just roaming around the streets of Los Santos or the arid hillsides of the desert. So much, in fact, that it really takes a lot to get bored of this game. I have played this game continually since I got it in Christmas of 2013, and I haven't put it down. This game is an absolute masterpiece.","What a amazing masterpiece of a video game. This game is purely amazing, everything about it is great, I currently own it on the Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC and I love each and every version of this amazing video game. The game is currently going for $30-$40 on the Xbox 360 so if you have the money I recommend you run to the store to pick up this game.","gta v on xbox 360 was a really hard game to review part of me really liked it and part of me hated it. however the xbox one version is way better so im going to review the game as if it was never on the 360 and ps3 first topic would be story. gta V tells a compelling and gripping and messed up tale that is really good and i would not like to spoil it because its just so good you have to see it yourself however either way i will say this it revolves around what happens when a meth head an L.A street hustler and a retired bank robber who is shockingly like tony soprano! but trust me there is way more to it then that the game has 69 missions witch is super short i can beat the game in about 2 weeks if i try hard enough especially becuase they added a mission check point system witch makes it extremely easy to play and just blast through the whole story but i wont really complain much becuase there is so much stuff to do in the game its insane and replaying the game in first person mode is really cool as stunts and combat is way more intense this time around because it feels like your really there! gta v also has a huge map to explore and lots of areas to see. also the game plays at a new 1080p resolution with improved textures and graphics the game looks so good and alot of people thhought the last gen version looked good but i thought it looked like **** but not anymore this game looks good no matter how you play in conclusion gta v is a great experience if you can manage  its shocking mature and political subject matter!","9 years ago, In 2008,  Grand Theft Auto IV blew everyone away with it's incredible gameplay, it's massive multiplayer matches, top of the line graphics for it's time, and a reason for it to be the best game in the franchise. 5 years later, GTA V took everyone by surprise, Rockstar went all out with GTA V and brought us back to the city of Los Santos that we haven't seen since San Andreas. The game is so beautifully detailed from faces of the three main characters and the pedestrians all throughout the streets, to the wide variety of nicely designed vehicles both brand new and some returning cars as well. I first bought this game when it first released on the last gen consoles, and I thought it was amazing then, but after being re-released on the current gen consoles, it looks even better than before. The story is the highlight in this game, despite the insanely fun multiplayer, where you play as not one, not two, but three main characters to play as. Each character has their own timeline and their own missions that don't involve all the others, it's a great way to see the character development individually. The three main characters are all criminals in their own ways, there's Michael, the recently un-retired professional criminal who is riddled with family issues, anger problems, and alcohol, Franklin, a member of the grove street gang, he is the best driver out of the three and is guy who want to do more than to be a regular criminal, and then there is Trevor, the psychotic, rage driven, hilariously unpredictable character who wants to make big bucks through his cocaine industry, and all these qualities make them who they are. The activities haven't changed very much since the first release, they stayed pretty much the same. The multiplayer is fun, the servers may not work half of the time, but when they work you can have the time of your life. Grand Theft Auto V is incredible feat, for a game that was released 4 years ago, it still can bring you hours of non-stop gameplay, GTA IV is slightly better but not by much, but nonetheless it is an amazing game to play whether you are here for it's visually striking graphics, it's fun multiplayer, or it's captivating story mode, Grand Theft Auto V is the result of a successful franchise that has been around for 20 years, and this is not the last we've heard of GTA V, far from it.","I have this game on both the XB360 and the XB1, why? BECAUSE IT IS FABULOUS.\r Ok, lets start with the story mode. You can play as Franklin, Michael and Trevor. You get to learn a bit about their background, family etc. It took me about a week or two to complete JUST the story. The story line never got boring, every mission was different to the one before that and just kept you gripped and intrigued. There are endless amounts of side missions, and the best of all is the free roam. You come across many weird and wonderful things whilst driving around Los Santos and Blain County. I could talk all day about how amazing it is.\r Next we'll talk about playing online. This is my favourite. Playing GTAV Online is the best thing about the whole game. You get to create your very own characters (you're aloud two characters male or female). There are hundreds of missions, races, deathmatches, last team standings, parachuting, capture missions, versus missions, the list is endless. You can even create your own races and team deathmatches, which is fun, then publish them or just mess around with them with your friends. When your level up your character you unclock so many things, for example clothing, haircuts, mods for your cars, weapons, weapon attachments etc.\r Rockstar Games do a good job of keeping people playing the game, for example every couple of months they bring out a new DLC, they're always free too.\r Overall this is and always will be for a long time, an amazing game. Almost 2 years on since it was brought out, and millions of people are still playing it every day.\r 10 OUT OF 10 FOR ME","this is probably one of the best games I've played in a long time. The huge open world, mixed with amazing graphics and senseless violence makes an amazing game. The story line is moving and it can be very dramatic. The online mode is just as fun and with heists out now, there is very little you can't do. I would definitely buy this game if you don't already have it.","Its GTA come on...AWESOME game! I just wish there was some sort of DLC for more missions so the fun never ends.\r 8/10 Personally because I havent really got in to GTA until this release but I look forward to GTA 6??? POSSIBLY, YES, NO??? :D","THE BEST GAME EVER MADE FOR HUMAN!! A great FPS with a awesome multiplier game .so if you wanna buy a game for your freetime you should buy gta v . I don't have anything to say about this beautiful game !","My favourite game franchise is Grand Theft Auto. I liked GTA V when it came out the last generation. Now, with updated graphics, more music on the radio and the ability to play the game in First Person, makes this the best game I've played.\r The story is great. You play as three characters;\r Michael De Santa - A former bank robber, now retired with his wife and two kids. After a mistake, he is forced to go back to what he's doing best. Michael is an expert with firearms.\rFranklin Clinton - A small time gangster, who want to live The American Dream. He joins Michael to fulfill that Dream. Franklin is an expert with cars.\rTrevor Phillips - A psychopath and drug dealer, living in his trailer. He and Michael used to work together. When Trevor discover that Michael is back in business, Trevor decides to pay him a visit. Trevor is an expert with helicopters.\r All missions is different and funny to play, especially when you can switch characters, both on missions and free roam. In some missions both Michael, Franklin and Trevor must work together. An example of this is in one mission where you must rescue a man from a building. To do this, Trevor must first fly to the building with a helicopter. Then, Michael needs to rappel down the building. While rescuing the man, Franklin must, across the building, assist Michael with shooting down enemies with a sniper rifle. After you rescued him, you can either play as Michael and take down choppers OR play as Trevor and avoid enemy fire. This scenario makes this game so brilliant. One of GTA V\u00b4s strongest Points is the bank heist missions. Here you must plan a heist of different kinds. You have two ways to execute the heist. Do you want to go in the loud and messy way or do you want to go the more silent and professional way? The choice is yours. Depending on which option you chose, you get different missions to prep the heist. One thing I don't like is that is only a few of this missions (I know that is more in GTA Online, but more of that later). You can also, besides missions, participate in side activities. You can play golf, do Yoga, hunt animals, skydive and more. I finished the game after 30+ hours (with side activities included). The only thing I DISLIKE about this game is GTA Online. All weapons, accessory and clothes are expensive, which ruins the fun. Luckily this doesn't affect the score for me. This is a must buy for fans of GTA!","Great Game, this is simply the best GTA ever released. i played it on my x360 and now i give try to xone version and it was fantastic! the only problem is GTA Online which is great but with to many cheaters its not fun anymore.","I would give this a 10 but no game is perfect but this comes really close. First you have the story which can be a solid 50 hours of gameplay even more if you have fun and do all the side quests, which could bring it up to 80hours. Then you can replay it and get even more hours out of the game. at first i was disappointed with multiplayer servers because they were super unreliable, but they fixed that pretty quickly. Multiplayer is awesome especially with the addition of Heists. Multiplayer will provide unlimited hours of gameplay and always provide something to do. The best part is they release updates for FREE with new cars, clothes, houses, side missions in game, and much more extra content to enhance the multiplayer for FREE!!!!! overall this game is easily the best game you can get for 60 dollars and a worthwhile buy.","B-E-S-T sandbox game ever. If you never were a fan of GTA for some weird reason, this is the best time to do so. The world is rich and alive, gorgeous. Who knew blowing stuff was fun","I don't think I need to say too much that isn't written elsewhere, it looks great, it plays great, the online is a blast and they keep adding more! The story is great to play, with many many hours just in the single-player, but get a group of friends, jump in the online and you'll never stop playing!","Graphical just beautiful, great story, charismatic characters and detailed super city, beautiful expressions, dubbing simply very well produced, many cars, motorcycles, etc., beautiful animations, one of the best games already played.\rFinal note: 9.9","Why don't developers make more games like this !!??!  Insanely good. Almost as good as San Andreas  .  .   .   .   .   .   .    .    .    .    .    .","It's a decent, overrated, game that leaves you plenty options to do even if you beat the campaign. The campaign was fun but many of the missions wouldn't show up on your map or mission info thing so you basically needed to use youtube for a majority of the time. It doesn't clearly describe to you what to do if this happens. Anyways, to the story, the story was very, umm, sort of unique. It's basically a city in America where you can do whatever the heck you want, and getting away from the police is simple, just keep driving away from them until they lose you. You can play three characters, each character with different views, opinions, missions, etc. The story itself is fun, but then it gets sort of weird and silly (in a good way, sort of). The characters are very laughable, especially Trever, my favorite character, but some just annoying like Mike. God was he annoying, and Franklin just looks like he just doesn't care that he's here for most of the time. To wrap this up, story is sometimes sloppy and way off but the game itself has a ton of fun things to do. For example, racing, gun fights, stuff like that and yeah. Solid 8/10.","OVERRATED! GTA San Andreas it's way far better, even GTA Vice City it's better.","Even though it came out at the end of last gen, GTAV is still one of the very best games of this generation.\r Single player:  The offline mode is as strong as ever, intertwining 3 playable character stories into one.  Graphically the most polished Rockstar game by far.  A longer story than many games, you can easily put 30-50 hours into the single player before it gets stale at all.\r Online:  I love GTAO and all the features that Rockstar has continued to add well after release.  The Heists took a while to come and to get right, but if you have a 4 person team to play the heists, they are some of the most fun in online gaming that I've experienced to date.\r 9/10","Well, game with interesting story, great main characters cooperation large great created world looking as real LA. I think, this is the best GTA ever and perhaps the best city action. There is fun, there are guns, cars and all of this in a good mix. I like on the story, it is not again cliche \"gangster story\". It is about bank robbers and it is really much more interesting than \"hey, go there, find my drugs and kill everyone\". This game has feeling of freedom, you can go anytime anywhere. There is difference between day and night activities. But I think, the map and whole world is empty. Look, when you dont fight with cops or make some mission, there is almost nothing to do. Nothing to explore, just few side activities, like some sports or car racing, but that is all. Online part of the game sucks, if you have no friend to cooperate. I dont think, that this is the best game ever. Really not. But it is still great game.","Excellent game, worth the used price everyday of the week.  Plenty of content, great story.\rExcellent game, worth the used price everyday of the week.  Plenty of content, great story.","This hands down the greatest game ever made. Worth $60...heck I would pay $100 for it. The depth, the detail, the gameplay, the graphics, the storyline, it all comes together into Rockstars legendary series. When developers take their time good things happen and Rockstar does this far better than any other developer. I liked it so much I bought it for the 360, the xbox one, and PC. No other game was more consequential and talked about and had that \"can't wait till I get home from school to play\" feel to it other than maybe Modern Warfare 2 and a few other games. No other game was more talked about in school and within the gaming community than GTA 5. I will say this no other RPG game has as a dynamic and smooth driving system as GTA. Definitely wins Game of the Decade, probably even best game of all time. And the Multiplayer is a thing of beauty, compared to the pathetic GTA 4 multiplayer, rockstar outdid themselves and continue to improve multiplayer.","I\u2019ll be the first to say that GTA V\u2019s load times make it one of the worst gaming experiences of recent memory. I don\u2019t plan on providing a full review, because I don\u2019t want to spend 20 minutes of every hour waiting for crap to load. After all sayed, the game is good but if You play 4 hours , you will spend 20 minutes in loading","Gr\u00e1ficos mejorados con respecto a la anterior generaci\u00f3n, de verdad se nota una gran diferencia. M\u00fasica variada en las estaciones de radio, se pueden quejar de que la historia es muy superficial, pero al ser una parodia de Estados Unidos, encaja perfectamente. Constante contenido agregado al GTA Online.","Grand Theft Auto V in my opinion is perfect. The story is always entertaining and funny and is so fun. The multiplayer is endless fun especially with friends. The missions are usually pretty simple and great. The heist are great getting to have a team and working together is the best when you finally complete one. The graphics are some of the best of the Xbox even in 2016. There is not much I can say about this game that has not already been said. If for some reason you don't have the game, get it! There's a reason it one of the best selling games of all time.","A good game with good missions BUT NO STORY AND MANY BAD-WORDS. But i still love this game. It has good graphic and many stunt points. S**** C*** and Sport cars...","The game that never stops giving! I've been playing it for 2 years and I'm still not tired of it. What more could I ask for? The campaign is so much fun and the stories are told in a way that actually has you sympathizing with the characters (even that psycho Trevor). GTA Online is fun but the load times are painful!","Great game played it on xbox 360 and xbox 1 it was that good. Story mode stunning faultless faultless graphics faultless voice acting very few minor glitches. online with its lack of heists is the only fault i could find with this game. 9/10","Grand Theft Auto V has a gigantic world of a ton of things to do. You can steal a jet, rob a grocery store or just listen to Non-Stop Pop FM everyday. Maybe be Snoopdog and SMOKE WEED EVERYDAY. I prefer GTA Online more than the story mode. Maybe story is better, but I don't care. It's Great.","Considero a GTA V un juego de mundo abierto muy cercano a la perfecci\u00f3n en su planteamiento. La inmersi\u00f3n de Los Santos, el deleite que es el moverse por ella, sus historias, la vida en la ciudad, lo org\u00e1nica que resulta, en fin, he jugado a pocos mundos abiertos tan bien construidos. Pienso a su vez que gran parte de la diversi\u00f3n en el mapa est\u00e1 relacionada con lo satisfactoria que es la conducci\u00f3n de todos los veh\u00edculos. T\u00e9cnicamente se ve bien y la m\u00fasica al m\u00ed me agrada, habr\u00e1 al menos una estaci\u00f3n musical que te guste, de eso no hay duda.\r Para m\u00ed s\u00f3lo hay dos fallos en el juego: la historia y algunas misiones. El primer punto no tiene que ver con la narraci\u00f3n, ni con los personajes, ni con el gui\u00f3n. Todo lo anterior est\u00e1 bien, el problema es que la historia no tiene un hilo, si no que mas bien es una suma de peque\u00f1as situaciones, algunas de las cuales sirven para agregar profundidad a algunos personajes siempre con el tono jocoso de que caracteriza a Rockstar, pero no que van mas all\u00e1 de eso. La historia para mi se resume en ser una suma de an\u00e9cdotas graciosas. Ac\u00e1 me permito ser cr\u00edtico porque hablamos del mismo estudio que dio vida a la historia de Tommy Vercetty, Carl Johnson y Niko Bellic. Bajaron el nivel en esta entrega.\r La segunda falla tiene mas que ver con el genero del juego que con otra cosa. Muchas misiones alternativas, y algunas principales caen en el viejo error de transformarnos en mensajes, o asesinos solo para abultar la duraci\u00f3n del juego. Esto las torna algo repetitivos, por suerte no son tantas, pero dado el alto nivel de algunas misiones, como por ejemplo los atracos se notan demasiado. Por lo que son una suerte de relleno que al menos a mi no me gust\u00f3 hacer.","I like playing this game a lot. The story is enjoyable, and it is cool to see the lives of 3 different people, and what they are doing in the world of crime. The graphics and sounds are phenomenal. It is very realistic in that way. The online is pretty good, but loading times are way to long. My favorite thing is to just explore the city in free roam. I like driving around and exploring the whole city. I recommend this game.","Spectacular game. No doubt. I know I am late to this but I just bought it after playing RDR2, and put 16 in 2 days into this game.","Grand Theft Auto V reached new heights in the franchise, incorporating similar elements from previous games as well as including new features that further enhance the experience. The game is graphically impressive, sound is excellent (I really enjoy the many songs in the radio stations), playability is very high (especially with the inclusion of GTA Online), gameplay mechanics are solid, and the story is engrossing, extensive, offering more variety over repetition. However, the game is not perfect as loading times can be VERY long, and despite how fun GTA Online is, the online mode has its faults. A few include occasional technical issues, repetitive missions to level up, presenting some room for improvement. Overall, I would highly recommend this game; it is one of the best open world games of this generation.","GTA V is arguably the best entry in the series. This upgraded port features several enhancements including higher resolution graphics, an increased framerate, more wildlife and a first-person mode. The city of Los Santos is an uncanny recreation of Los Angeles (if not entirely accurate) and the gameplay is sinful fun. The script is filled with profanity, violence and vulgarity. Of course, the game is also a satire of contemporary American life. However, unlike its predecessors, this installment has thrived on its multiplayer component. Rockstar Games has constantly updated it with various events and missions. Overall, if you're a fan of the series, then you'll love GTA V. It's a masterpiece. I would rate the Xbox One version with a 10 out of 10.","This is such a fun game. I have had so much fun in this game, probably more than any other. It is the best free roam game I've ever played. I highly recommend this game to anyone old enough to play it.","Entertaining, but leaves little impact. I enjoyed my play-through of Grand Theft Auto V and some missions definitely stood out, (namely the \"Big Lebowski\" inspired flying over the city, and the alien missions), but there are definitely some missions that are rather basic run and gun. The characters are just okay, but I do love how their missions will sometimes overlap. The soundtrack is definitely stellar and there are many improvements mechanically over Grand Theft Auto IV. GTA V is a decent play-through, and while it does have tons of replay-ability, its not a game that I find myself running back to.","Fun Game for a low price. I bought this game in 2017 and there is still a lot I have to do. It is also fun to screw around in Los Santos, trying to survive police chases, etc.","Hikaye = 7\rOynan\u0131\u015f = 8\rGrafikler = 9\rSesler = 8\rKeyif = 9\rAtmosfer = 8\rS\u00fcre = 8","Um bom game,por\u00e9m falhou no modo hist\u00f3ria.Mesmo com personagens interessantes e com personalidades memor\u00e1veis,o game falha em apresentar uma hist\u00f3ria que prenda o jogador como as franquias Halo ou Shadow Of The Colossus.

The gameplay is outstanding. There are still updates and additions rolling out after six years. The graphics, while imperfect, definitely hold up. A few minor issues: the toxic online community, too much power put into microtransactions, and those without Live will definitely get bored of it after the story ends. Otherwise, this game is close to perfect.","Sin lugar a duda; uno de los mejores sandbox de la historia.

Graphics were supreme. It's really a new city coming to life in this game.","I know this opinion will make some people come for my neck.\r So, I've been trying to find meaning in GTA V, in terms of fulfilment in the overall objective. and so since 2013 (6 years later :) ), two weeks ago was the first time i got to complete the game after about a month of playing, but man, even with about 2 Billion in each of the character's bank account, the game just felt dead in the end, i felt like i haven't achieved much.\r Getting all the cars and planes is cool and fun but so what ? it means nothing for the single player, I don't have a heart for online gaming (yet) but even that is just will be the same rollercoaster of getting rich and leaving you empty in the end.\r As much as we love gaming, the end result should have a fulfilment, a need that's accomplished. For example when i completed Ghost Recon Wildlands, i felt like i did a good job liberating the people of \"Bolivia\" from Tyrant Drug King Ruler. But in GTA V ... the getting rich wasn't much of a fulfilment.\r One thing though I learnt is that Rockstar put a lot of work in that game, the story is amazing, the details put in Los Santos to represent everyday life is no small thing and most times i was enjoying the game but the end goal left me yearning for more.","Over time as I have went back to play it recently I can not help but say this game is timeless it is nearly 6 years old now and it's better than some of not most the games to come out recently. The game just has a way to keep you on the edge of your seat even 6 years later and to get you attached to characters as you go through their crazy lives with all 3 different polarizing personalities and lifestyles. The graphics for when this game came out too were top notch and the world design absolutely where rockstar nailed this game it just feels like everything you see that moves or live it can interact with you from the animals in the Forests to the thousands of people in the city this game is just spot on. Gameplay is good for it's time but it shows its age a bit especially with the release of RDR2. Although that's a given with the technology getting better as this game ages. Although the games biggest issues besides it's online is how short it feels this game needed to be longer I wish this game had a DLC something I barely say I ever want but this game was one of this games I wish it had either way this is just another rockstar piece that they just nailed.","Without a doubt probably the best video game ever created for any console. However, they've made it near impossible to play without paying money which is really annoying. The worst part though is the online play. Almost NEVER works. Constantly loses connection for no reason. Incredibly frustrating. I play other online games like NBA live with no problem. They need to fix this and then I'd give it a perfect rating.","Eu realmente pensava que nenhum GTA iria superar o que o GTA SAN ANDREAS havia sido para mim, a\u00ed a Rockstar resolve lan\u00e7ar o GTA V...

Unique graphics. Great story. Ability to switch between the three characters and their different lives. Cars are like reality. Sub-missions and 100% game play are important points of GTA V.","One of the best games I have ever played. there is so much to do, even after beating the story mode. its a must buy, i spent over a year of time and still there is something to do","Dont go to politics, 2 hours offline-2 hours of hating you bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb","Amazing game Grand Theft Auto is a true masterpiece. It\u2019s not my favorite Rockstar game Red Dead Redemption 2 holds that honor.","I feel like this game is missing a lot of small but immersive features that made other GTA games great. A lack of interiors to explore. Pedestrians die instantly when they go down instead of being injured. The cops start shooting you for no reason and are annoying instead of fun. The melee fighting, the driving and the car physics are mediocre compared to GTA 4. Most of the missions were fun, but the story was mediocre and disappointing. The game gets boring very quickly after you beat the story missions.","No review text.","Bad game....................................................................","This game is unfathomably bad. Starting with major bugs and glitches that apply to story and online mode. AI's with automatic weapons randomly burst fire and kill you instantly regardless if your armor and health is full. They also have perfect accuracy and can kill you with a pistol even if your over 1000 feet away in game. They even shoot you while behind solid non destructible cover! You can get shot by NPC's that are not shown on your screen which essentially means they are completely invisible and no i'm not talking about the ones that are suppose to go invisible. AI drivers are out to crash into you on certain jobs that require vehicle delivery that can't be damaged without penalty. Vehicle physics in general are very buggy. Loading times are very unreasonably long for even simple tasks. Also infinite loading screens too. There are lots of other game play bugs that I have not listed here. Now with Rock star itself. They are very greedy with micro transactions. They don't ban hackers that grief other normal players. Their employees manually kick players from session when they are doing some then important such as heists, jobs, and etc. They are obsessed with this boring player versus player crap that's more lame than chores. Now ending with other miscellaneous nonsense. Story mode is terrible and game play elements were implemented in the worst way possible. You can't own vehicles like you can in online which is dumb and any vehicles you store can disappear. There are lots of other things that I didn't list in this review. There are some good things in this game that are decent but most ruined by dumb gimmicks that shouldn't be in the game. 1/10 score to be honest.","De las mejores piezas, este juego seguir\u00e1 dando de que hablar con El Paso de los a\u00f1os debido a que cuenta con gr\u00e1ficos que parecen actuales, un modo online que es muy diverso y muchos modos de interacci\u00f3n","The story is very good, with a lot of action and you end up understanding the characters. But, online is getting worse. Either you play long hours and buy business, or you pay real money. People are very heavy and will always want to bother you while you are on a mission. The beats no longer make that much money and only business matters.","While I do like the Single Player campaign, the Online mode is no good. Griefers all over the online one.

In conclusion GTA V is a great game and a must play, but it doesn't deserve such a high ranking","uma grande evolu\u00e7\u00e3o na franquia gta,e no mundo dos games,porem falha em alguns poucos aspectos como: o que fazer apos zerar? o jogo n\u00e3o te passa essa vontade de o que fazer apos zerar a historia principal,e sim,tem muitas miss\u00f5es segundarias,porem elas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o t\u00e3o divertidas assim,outro aspecto mediano do jogo \u00e9 um tanto quanto enjoativo,as missoes n\u00e3o s\u00e3o repetitivas,mas um tanto quanto sem tempero,porem vale um 5 pelo modo historia,e 1 pelos ester egg\u00b4s e 1 pelo mapa e 0,5 pelos minigames do online  0,5 pela falta de loot box paga e microtransa\u00e7\u00f5es excessivas e 0,5 da divers\u00e3o garantida com amigos","O melhor jogo de todos os tempos!

A fun story to play, great online character creation and options of things to buy (Cars, clothes, property, etc) Always has been one of the best games around.","GTA is GTA there is no need to elaborate on this game.\rIt works properly, maybe sometimes monotonous, but still lacks the atmosphere of Vice City.","Grand theft auto V may be by far one of the worst games of all time in terms of user experience. A complete disregard for player to player balancing and bugs makes this one of the most frustrating, unrewarding, and disappointing games of all time. Spent an hour getting a boat for a heist? Good luck, once you get it to the objective point, nothing happens, it just tells you to get to the objective point. Until the time runs out. Fun. Just spawned? Good luck, don\u2019t bother getting in a car, someone already has their homing missiles on you. And they\u2019re ten times faster than you. So what do you do? Pull your homing missiles out. Wow! Back and forth wasting time spawning different militarized weapons for hours! Fun!While this game is huge, and packed with content, a complete lack of care for the content makes it one of the worst, most saturated games of all time.","I really enjoyed this game, there are many elements of the game that refer to the LGBTQA community this is shown in a random event that players can encounter near the RON Alternates Wind Farm where two men are having sex inside an RV I think this is important because it shows part of the history of LGBTQA community also that people have the freedom to choose male or female Character in online mode or director mode.","GTA V was one of my favorite games from RockStar, but I can tell you that this game is really cool, but to be honest there are some cons too. About cons I can say that: That this game shows us that the main protagonist is Michael, but for some reason Franklin is the most playable character in the game because he has more quests than Michael or Trevor. Second con is the choice of endings, I won't say what are the endings, but I can say that first 2 endings are bad not because it has not a really good ending, but because it's not really logical, so I recommend u to choose only good ending because it's not only a logic, but also the ending is really epic. Now about pros. First pro is that the heist missions are really cool because you can choose the plan of the heist, my favorite is the Juggernaut suit heist! Another pro is the list of characters, my favorite were Lamar who even became a meme with his 'Yee-Yee Ass haircut', Trevor who is just my favorite character because this guy is crazy but he's actually not that bad person because he a bit cares about some people, just like his mom and Patricia who was a wife of a mafia boss. So, I was really worried for Trevor and I think he's better than Vaas from Far Cry 3!\r So my grade for GTA V is 8/10!","The game was released in 2014 (XBOX ONE version) I was playing it in 2020. Yeah I know, I know 6 years later... The pandemic came as you might know and decided to buy a console to play some games which I wanted but did not have a chance. However, I was really shocked by all the details which Rockstar put into this game. The surrounding... they were surreal. I was enjoying time by time just to drive around the San Andreas state and appreciate all the details and surroundings. As well I had really fun playing with all the protagonists. I give respect to Rockstar that they try to innovate and introduce 3 characters instead of 1 how it used to be. By knowing that the game was released in 2013 I believe it was a brave step by them by knowing how huge is the fan base of the series. The most negative part of this game is the storyline. Personally, for me, it was worst compared with Vice City, San Andreas, or GTA IV. I did not have this feeling how I used to have with previous parts of this series. Or maybe it is just because I am getting older....","Great story, incredibly fun to play and to mess around in, and good graphics. The Online portion is also very very fun (if you are in a NAT type lobby), as if you can be in thesse lobbies without anyone, then it becomes easy but fun. Online generally though is very very toxic.\r Would 100% recommend the game, very very fun and great to play.","great game the sad thing about the game is you cant olay it like the first time again","GTA 5 is the first part of the GTA series that I ever played, only 2 weeks ago. For me, I like a lot of game options, a range of cars and weapons and the size of the map. But the thing that annoys me is, at least in my opinion, very stupid control. If you're an Xbox gamer and you've played more game titles, you're sure to notice. In my opinion, control in the Mafia, for example, is much easier.","Definitely the best experience a video game has to offer as of 2021. Grand Theft Auto five it's an incredible and immersive experience that will take you to the fictional city of Los Santos creating the best atmosphere a game has ever done.","Rj5iw5j jsrrhr fbarhatydk tnttsfstmtsjst rw4jwrw fanwtet rbretjts fnrwwtrh jdjf hfj fjfj chfjdj fjfidhf dyeifi dhfyfy dge dhud dicdidu dufuwhcyhddu hcydy ycucu uufuchcyvh uucychf7 hc6vhf7cjc7cfhycfjuvjf8 ncic dcnf c fjv fcn fnc fjcf jc fnf fcn fcn","A great well rounded game. Its what you would expect from a GTA game. It can be played for its compelling story, for its uniqueley fun and toxic online, or as a fun sandbox. The story is great and diverse. You can do nearly anything you could in the real world, from getting a car wash, to kidnapping hookers. Unlike the other Grand Theft Autos, you can acsess a thing called Director Mode, and play the game for its unlimited Sandbox like feautures. The open world is diverse, and hyper realistic like Red Dead Redemptions. It has alot of in game mysteries that the playerbase is still trying to solve 7 years later, such as the Chilliad mystery. There are strangers and freaks (A complete knockoff of Red Dead Redemptions stranger missions, but there both Rockstar so it doesnt matter.) which help complete the world. You can also Beat, Rob, and Kill in GTA Online. A toxic community, but in a good way. GTA Online makes you Heistatron from Rick and Morty, (Not actually) and your main goal is to rob, from gas stations, to a the giant drug cartels of Cayo Parico. Overall a great game with graphics that still hold up, 8 years later. The only reason that it isnt i a 10 is because of one thing: Once you get bored, you cant not be bored. its like Sea of Theives in that matter, of once your bored, theres no coming back.","6/13/21-6/25/21 100% Story 90% Side Missions 6/10 Stars\r I finally pushed myself to finish this game after several years of false starts. Between the controls and the overly long story it was a tough road for sure.\r The story follows Franklin (Ice Cube from Friday, complete with funny side-kick), Michael (NOT Tommy Vercetti, which I was expecting and would have been a cool twist) and Trevor (Favorite character of all thirteen year olds who still think swearing is edgy). Franklin runs into the retired thief Michael and soon begins pulling off heists of all shapes and sizes. Eventually, they draw the attention of Trevor, an old and bitter acquaintance from Michael's past. The three of them get involved in one mess after another.\r The story did have compelling moments, but it was incredibly long with some story lines that seemed to go nowhere. The problem with three protagonists is that you don't get as attached to any of them. Not that any of them are decent characters. Trevor is usually gross and Michael is a sad sack. The closest proper character might be Franklin, but he still is a bit one note and doesn't really grow throughout the story. There are some genuinely funny lines and situations, but more often written with a very stupid  and childish sense of humor.\r The absolute worst component of this game is the way the characters and vehicles control. Even at the highest driving skill level and the best cars, you'll feel like you're driving on ice. There are so many games that have done driving controls way better, it's incredibly frustrating to be in a high speed chase only to hit a pole and be spun around in the other direction. Walking is even worse! After thirty hours I still had trouble pointing any character in the right direction. The most difficult part of any mission is fighting with the controls.\r The mission design is quite varied, some can be a bit tedious with all the driving. At least the heists that pop up throughout the story do get quite interesting. They are usually pretty well designed with different approaches and planning. Switching between characters during these missions is well done when each one has their own skills to contribute.\r It is very difficult to score this game too low. Clearly a ton of time has gone into the world design and the graphics and scenery are still incredibly well done. Video games are made by so many teams of people, whichever of those teams that handled the story and (especially) the controls definitely did a terrible job. The teams that created the world and environments still deserve credit for excellent work.","I play gta on xbox one and I've never been so angry with a support (I didn't even need a support as much) as in this game.","EN:\rLevel below GTA: SA. The story is quite good and extremely huge, due to the presence of 3 main characters. All three have a great back story and the mechanics of the game fit them perfectly into a trio. The missions are solid, but again the same problem, the player does not have the freedom to complete the missions. Everything is linearly scripted. The graphics are great, as is the optimization, the FPS is constantly stable. The map is huge and detailed.\r SRP:\rNivo ispod GTA:SA. Pri\u010da je dosta dobra i izuzetno obimna, zbog prisustva 3 glavna lika. Sva trojica imaju odli\u010dan back story i mehanika igre ih savr\u0161eno uklapa u trio. Misije su solidne, ali opet isti problem, igra\u010d nema slobodu u izvr\u0161avanju misija. Sve je linearno skriptovano. Grafika je sjajna, kao i optimizacija, FPS je konstantno stabilan.

I liked each of the 3 main protagonist as they were all different in their own way. Adding the first person view was a good small addition.","Smooth and fun gameplay. Variety in arsenal and vehicles. Lacking content that previous predecessors had. Outdated controls.\r The story is mediocre. The characters aren't fleshed out enough, like for Franklin, I don't care enough for. Trevor is likeable, yet psychotic and unpredictable, wish we knew more about him. Michael, is the most fleshed out character, we see how he interacts and treats his family, how horrible of a person he is, and yet at the end of it all, Michael is an amazing character with great development.\r Online is pay to win. So it really sucks the fun out of the experience.\r A MUST-BUY FOR ALL GAMERS.","um excelente game como todos j\u00e1 sabem,por\u00e9m ele j\u00e1 est\u00e1 ultrapassado e com o online mtt enjoativo na minha vis\u00e3o.","The game is pretty good IF WE TALK ABOUT THE STORY MODE the online is horrible but the story mode is really fun with dynamical missions , the story is fine but, the gameplay is great buy it is great","Pura divers\u00e3o e v\u00e1rios jogos em um s\u00f3.

The large realistic open world is interesting, the story is well written as well as the characters, the humour is on point for me, and the missions are fun and well designed, but they can start feeling a bit stale eventually.
