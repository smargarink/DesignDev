A little kissing and very little sex but that aspect is very little. The romance is actually cute. Most importantly, this book teaches a lot about feminism; intersectional feminism and privileged feminism. It encourages people to broaden their way of thinking and to embrace people of all sexual orientation, colour and all that. There\'s a lot to learn from it.

I think because it was also so heavily reliant on New York slang, which I hear constantly in my day-to-day life but prefer not to read it because it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely informal. There were a lot of moments where I enjoyed Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s unfiltered nature in dialogue, but the way her thought process was written is not a favorite of mine. In contrast, there were also a few scenes that felt the complete opposite. I can recount quite a few scenes where the tone was almost \xe2\x80\x9cpreachy\xe2\x80\x9d (specifically from Harlowe &amp; her friends); I sometimes felt as if I was in a lecture on women\xe2\x80\x99s studies as opposed to observing a natural conversation. I feel there is a balance to be made between formality and informality when writing and this book seemed to teeter between one extreme end and the other. Additionally, Juliet Takes A Breath is another one of those novels that falls into the category of \xe2\x80\x9cJust follow the main character throughout their summer!!!\xe2\x80\x9d which is my least favorite sort of contemporary to read. While this novel does prevail over others as so much of the novel is driven by Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s journey to learning about feminism, it\xe2\x80\x99s plotless besides that. I crave stories with significant events, plot twists, highs and lows, but this book remained constant for 2/3 of the story.Given the lack of plot, I thoroughly enjoyed the discussions happening along the story. It was really wonderful to follow a teen in the process of developing their brand of feminism \xe2\x80\x93 from learning new terminology to questioning their values and confronting their biases. I remember what it is like to come in contact with words like \xe2\x80\x9cpreferred gender pronouns\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9callyship\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpolygamy\xe2\x80\x9d Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s journey is extremely well-rounded and does not miss a beat when it comes to expressing what an intersectional feminist looks like. I particularly loved her by the end when we get to see Juliet unapologetically herself, forming her own opinions, and exploring the QPOC community where she truly belongs. I feel Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s story is one that is powerful, one that is necessary, and one that everyone can take something away from. Following the perspective of a Puerto-Rican lesbian discovering feminism is an experience I cherished and I hope to read from more protagonists like Juliet in the future. As a character, she is imperfect and a bit na\xc3\xafve, but she is also open and authentic, funny and curious, and she is so wonderfully herself that it was hard not to fall for her along the story.The part of this book I struggled with the most is the infamous Harlowe Brisbane. I could not STAND her or any scene involving her. I attempted to brush it off to differences in lifestyle (The whole \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a ceremony for your period\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m honored you\xe2\x80\x99d bleed out of your vagina in my household\xe2\x80\x9d is NOT my thing, but I recognize that is how other people live their lives and that\xe2\x80\x99s fine!) but all throughout the story I grew to dislike her more and more. I feel the tipping point for me was when Harlowe dismissed Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s requests for advil to alleviate her menstral cramps and badgered her into following her personal methods because she was *clearly* the ~more enlightened feminist~ which means *her view is correct!* Harlowe is dripping with white feminism 24/7 and Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s blind dedication to her gave me a headache every time I picked up the book. That being said, Harlowe\xe2\x80\x99s flaws are unearthed and challenged by the end of the story so I can recognize that she was intentionally written to be a symbol of when feminism becomes exclusionary, so that was appreciated. But on the other hand, Harlowe made this book unbearable to read at some points so while I can admit it was executed well in the end, I\xe2\x80\x99m still entitled to be annoyed at how much she damped my enjoyment of the story for the majority of the book.Overall, Juliet Takes A Breath was an enjoyable read. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a favorite of mine by any means, but I still feel there is so much value in Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s story. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it is the strongest novel in the world in terms of storytelling, but there is a message to be spread through Juliet. And it is heard.  ...more                                                flag      222 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View 2 comments                                                      Mar 26, 2017              Cece (ProblemsOfaBookNerd)              rated it        it was amazing                              Shelves:              lgbtqia,               my-books,               favorites,               female-protag,               read-in-2017,               anticipated-of-2016,               e-arcs                                                &quot;Feminism.

And a book that will stay with me. Juliet is a 19-year-old Puerto Rican lesbian from the Bronx who goes to be an intern for a hippy white feminist in Portland, and who also happens to have written Juliet\'s favorite book. It is a book about pussy power. But fear not, those worrying (as I did) about the cissexist nature of that book: it is called out frequently in the latter half of the novel! Just as so many other things are. In Portland, Juliet is part of an incredibly queer community. The number of queer women around at all times in this novel was impossible to ignore and it made my heart sing. Queer women of color, specifically, were essential in Juliet coming to understand the terminology she needed to define her own identity and to help offer new definitions of feminism and queer identity that can feel more inclusive to her.It feels rare to experience such visibly queer spaces in books. Not just queer spaces that happen in one scene, but a constantly queer environment that is full of support but also critique and questioning of white feminist structures. Beyond the presence of queer spaces, there is also so much emphasis on POC-only spaces and the importance that they have. Over and over again, the bullshit complaints of white feminists are shot down and intersectionality is emphasized, explained, and made the most important part of the feminism Juliet is trying to learn. A feminism that includes her, in all her Puerto Rican lesbian glory.Not to continue gushing, but some of my other favorite moments include: an entire chapter dedicated to making the period a celebrated experience, the strained but intensely loving relationship between Juliet and her mother, the entire chapter entitled "Ain\'t No Party Like an Octavia Butler Writer\'s Workshop", girls flirting, close family relationships, mini history lessons about amazing forgotten women of color, and about a hundred other things.OH OH OH and I almost forgot: the almost embarrassing amount of realism that queer women become completely useless in the presence of other beautiful lady-identified individuals. Every time Juliet saw a fabulous queer lady and lost the ability to speak or spit out coherent sentences I was on another planet of joy. This is the coming of age story of a fierce, funny, nerdy, chubby, intelligent Latina. It was breathtaking and sharp, full of so much goodness I know I\'ll be able to find new things again and again. It acts as an intro for those who don\'t know queer and feminist terminology, but also serves as a critique of the whiteness of those structures if you already do. It is ownvoices and vibrant and incredible. I\'m begging you to read it.   ...more                                                flag      181 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View all 9 comments                                                      Dec 07, 2019              Kai              rated it        really liked it          &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;          review of another edition                              Shelves:              owned,               queer                                                when Roxane Gay tells you a book is &quot;f***ing outstanding&quot; you make your humble butt take a seat and read it  when Roxane Gay tells you a book is "f***ing outstanding" you make your humble butt take a seat and read it  ...more                                                flag      126 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review                                                              Jun 06, 2016              Adri              rated it        it was amazing          &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;          review of another edition                              Shelves:              ownvoices,               favorites,               queer-lit,               latinx-authors                                                Damn, this book is beautiful.

But then I started reading the book, and I realized: Holy shit. This book is about me.This book celebrates all the different kinds of wonderfully brown humans in the world. It challenges stereotypes and rejoices in people who come from different backgrounds, who hold different beliefs, who believe and act differently than the world expects them to, and who give no fucks about it. This story interrogates the institution of feminism and queer spaces, especially when both of those tend to privilege white voices and bodies. Juliet constantly struggles with how she should feel about feminism and queer theory, when neither of these things were made for her, or with her in mind. How anyone who isn\'t white is expected to to accept white feminism\xe2\x80\x94white anything\xe2\x80\x94as the universal truth, how we are expected to find ourselves there when we were never written into it in the first place. How those who have been othered can other people themselves. How we are forced to assimilate and assume a language that was never made for us. How doing so can create a division with our roots and make us feel like we\'re "not brown enough."And how Juliet\'s family took her coming out? Don\'t even get me started on how much truth was present on the page there. It\'s so hard to balance the respect you have for your roots, your parents, your life forces, with the knowledge that some days are going to be harder than others. One day they\'re chill and the next they\'re trying to talk you down from it or convince you that it\'s just a phase. How no one wants to confront it or talk about it\xe2\x80\x94some days it\'s just ignore, ignore, ignore at all costs\xe2\x80\x94because then they think it\'ll go away or it won\'t be real. How we need to be patient and trust in the love that our fams give us, even when it\'s not easy. How some days we can\'t act or present ourselves in a way that\'s authentic to us, because those are the concessions we have to make sometimes in order to live and keep the peace. Para la familia. Every day is a negotiation.Y\'all, this book just hit me deep. I live this damn struggle every day and Gabby Rivera managed to perfectly capture it in less than 300 pages. Every page of this book made me feel alive and known. And I still don\'t know how to put that into words.If you\'re queer and brown and still trying to figure out how to exist in this world, please read this book. It\'s for you.  ...more                                                flag      106 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View all 5 comments                                                      Jun 14, 2017              \xe2\x9c\xa8    jami   \xe2\x9c\xa8              rated it        really liked it                              Shelves:              feminist,               lgbtqiap,               young-adult,               2017-reads,               contemporary                                                  if it\xe2\x80\x99s a phase, so what? if it\xe2\x80\x99s your whole life, who cares? you\xe2\x80\x99re destined to evolve and understand yourself in new ways you never imagined before.LANGUAGE WARNING FOR THIS REVIEWFrom the very moment Juliet Milagros Palante referred to herself as a ferocious cunt I knew I&apos;d like this book.

Second of all, because I just think there\'s something entirely glorious about referring to yourself as a ferocious cunt. This book is one of those books I worry people won\'t read or will dnf because it\'s not got that much plot. It\'s a coming of age story, and I get why people say it\'s boring but this book is so entirely well written, well addressed, well researched and well presented it\'s a massive fucking shame if people walk past it. Even though it\'s not a typical fast moving plot, I still felt myself constantly reaching for this because it was endlessly interesting in other ways then plot.   I fall asleep with that book in my arms because words protect hearts and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got this ache in my chest that won\xe2\x80\x99t go away.Juliet Takes a Breath follows Puerto Rican lesbian girl Juliet Palante who\'s recently been introduced to feminism and "Pussy Power" by Portland writer Harlowe Brisbane. Juliet takes up a summer intern with Harlowe, and the story basically followers her as she navigates her internship. ( by nomoreheroestwo on tumblr)The truly beautiful and unique thing about this book is the incredible visibility of queer spaces, and especially queer spaces for women of colour. This book debunks and challenges aspects of feminism and womanhood that are exclusionary, cissexist or racist and promotes intersectionality. Juliet must confront and explore how her sexuality, gender and ethnicity intersect and that exploration is something so rarely seen in YA. What I liked about this is it kinda feels like you take Juliet\'s hand and learn as she does. This forced me to address and acknowledge some of my own white privilege and cissexism and I really liked that about it. If you\'re willing to go into it open minded you will genuinely learn alot about modern feminism, lgbt+ communities, QPOC spaces and intersectional feminism. Gabby Rivera feels in control and educated on every subject that comes up - this is own voices, but still a part of me was worried the exclusionary aspects of Harlowe\'s feminism would never be addressed. Shame on me for having no faith, Rivera masterfully writers and crafts her story. Aside from the larger themes, this book has such cute romance elements. There\'s a cute librarian girl who rides a motorbike and goes stargazing !! And an interracial couple with no white people !! (Kira is biracial Korean and White) There is also a poly relationship. And aaah it\'s so cute !! And Juliet is soo tongue tied over the cute girls and it was just sweet and not sexualised or anything but was just soft and realistic and I LOVED IT. Genuinely, I think this is such an important and well written book. I think it\'s important book that offers so much visible spaces for lgbt+ youth and especially queer women of colour. This book is filled to the brim with strong, outspoken and beautiful queer, poc women and it truly made my heart sing. The representation matters so much to me, and I imagine it matters even more to brown girls. This book feels so rare, like I don\'t know if I\'ll read anything which forefronts queer spaces this much again. I will never be over it. I genuinely want everyone to read this - whether you\'re gay, white, female or not. I feel so incredibly gushy about this book - like, you don\'t understand how validated and good this makes me feel and it isn\'t even for me. I am so happy Juliet got to find and experience spaces that included her, and a brand of feminism she could claim. Juliet\'s story is incredibly important, she\'s a chubby, latina queer women who finds her voice, her discovers and claims her own sexuality and spaces. The sharpness and poignancy of this book will not be forgotten by me, it\'s a terribly important story, a true look into how queer women of colour are struggling and it\'s a great intro book to inclusionary feminism which also serves as a critique and reminder to white feminist. I am literally willing to beg people to read this, it\'s that important.   Kiss everyone.Ask first.Always ask first and then kiss the way the stars burn in the sky.  ...more                                                flag      76 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View all 9 comments                                                      Jan 25, 2016              CaseyTheCanadianLesbrarian              rated it        it was ok                              Shelves:              american,               fiction,               queer,               young-adult,               latina-o,               lesbian,               reading-in-colour,               humour                                                Man, I hate to give this only 2 stars but I just can&apos;t honestly give it any more.

And the characterization was so shallow; most of the characters never felt real to me. Ultimately, I was just really bored reading this. I\'ve read some of Rivera\'s journalism and essays on Autostraddle, which I thought were great, but fiction is a VERY different kind of writing and this entire novel needs a gigantic editorial makeover to transform it into that. So much of it read like a Queer 101 textbook and/or journal entries.

Because this book represents everything I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for in a Contemporary. Everything.The main character, Juliet, just came out to her entire family before leaving for Portland for the entire summer. She goes there to be the Pussy Lady\xe2\x80\x99s intern, a very well loved white feminist lady who wrote Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s favourite book, Raging Flower.And I loved Juliet, I loved how clueless she is about the LGBTQ community, about feminism, about herself, because we discover all these things with her. We experience her doubts, her sadness, her happiness, her pain, and it was freaking beautiful.Juliet goes through a lot, she meets new people, open her mind to a world she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know existed, she finds herself, or at least she begins to understand who she wants to be.Me. Because I\xe2\x80\x99m a messy, over-emotional, book nerd, weirdo, chubby brown human and I needed to learn how to love myself, even the shameful bits.This book deals a lot with feminism and how different feminism can be for a lot of people. I admit, I was extremely afraid at the beginning of this book, because I felt like the feminism that was described was only meant for white cis women, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to find this kind of bullshit in this book. But turned out the book condemns strongly this \xe2\x80\x98kind\xe2\x80\x99 of feminism.I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why it mattered so much. Like, what was so bad about Raging Flower? Ava said it was because Harlowe didn\xe2\x80\x99t make queer and or trans women of color a priority in her work; that Harlowe assumed that we could all connect through sisterhood, as if sisterhood looked the same for everyone. As if all women had vaginas.\xe2\x80\x9cUm, Ava, don\xe2\x80\x99t all women have vaginas?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, staring at her.\xe2\x80\x9cFuck no. We just talked about this,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is why I can\xe2\x80\x99t fuck with Harlowe. All Harlowe does is equate being a woman to bleeding and having certain body parts. Like, I\xe2\x80\x99m so not with that. For me, womanhood is radical enough for anyone who dares to claim it.\xe2\x80\x9dAlso guys, there was an ENTIRE chapter on polyamory relationships and on MENSTRUATIONS. CAN YOU BELIVE THAT ?! In our society, periods are still really taboo even though they\'re the most natural thing ever. People need to talk about periods in books more often, because young ladies need to understand they have nothing to feel ashamed of.Know your period as you know yourself. Touch the wobbling blobs of blood and tissue that escape and land intact on your favorite period panties. Note the shades of brown and purple and volcanic reds that gush, spill, and squirt out announcing themselves. Slide fingers deep inside your cunt and learn what your period feels like before it\xe2\x80\x99s out of your body. Masturbate to ease cramps and meditate to soothe the spirit. Connect to your blood cycle. Build sacred rituals around your body during this time of renewal.I wish I could do this book justice, I truly do, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a terrible mess right now. I needed to read this book, because as a biracial bisexual woman I needed to feel like somebody had my back, and this book totally offered to watch it for me.All of the women in my life were telling me the same thing. My story, my truth, my life, my voice, all of that had to be protected and put out into the world by me. No one else. No one could take that from me. I had to let go of my fear. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what I was afraid of.Also, Cece\'s review is so much better than mine, so go read it please, you won\'t regret it !  ...more                                                flag      52 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View all 15 comments                                                      Feb 05, 2016              Vanessa North                added it                                              Oh my heart.

At 19, I was a student in Asheville, North Carolina (like a southern, mini Portland) and there were a lot of Harlowe Brisbane types in my life. I loved how Juliet was open to confronting all the new concepts being thrown at her and how she filtered them through herself and embraced trying out even the ones she ultimately chose to reject. Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s openness was part of what made her such a powerful personality to read.That openness was full of vulnerability too. Knowledge is a currency, and people give it or with hold it with their own motivations and insecurities and intentions all twisted up together. There was this one scene where Juliet is humiliated and made to feel small because she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know everything\xe2\x80\x94or even much of anything\xe2\x80\x94about being queer. And I remembered back to 1996 and coming out to a lesbian friend in Asheville, and how she made me feel small and like I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good enough queer because I was just \xe2\x80\x9ctrying on bi.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s right, bi-erasure (not that I had that word yet) with a shame-cherry on top. So, when Juliet experienced something similar, I felt Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s tears all the way back to the cruelty of that moment and how much it affected my relationships with other queer women for years. In that scene, I felt such a deep connection with Juliet, because I knew exactly how she felt. We think we\xe2\x80\x99re safe around other queer people, that they can\xe2\x80\x99t or won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt us because they understand. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to learn, but we can be hurt just as much\xe2\x80\x94and more\xe2\x80\x94by cruelty within the queer community. I wish I could have read this twenty years ago!And love. Oh love, love, love. I LOVE how this book talks about love. About familial love, and romantic love, and the feel of falling in love with someone through words. The fierce love of female friendship. The bittersweet urgent love of a summer fling. I\xe2\x80\x99m a romance novelist for a living, so I spend a lot of time thinking about love, and how we show it, and how we know when we\xe2\x80\x99re feeling it, and how we feel loved. Juliet is wise\xe2\x80\x94Juliet knows you can feel love and be deeply loved all in one beautiful moment and that letting that moment be huge and awesome and everything\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s putting love into the world. Juliet was sometimes scared and confused and often hurt, but she *loved*. And that\'s a special kind of fearlessness.Perhaps some of the strongest and most important parts of this story are the parts I\xe2\x80\x99m least qualified to comment on\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m very much aware that while as a queer woman I related to Juliet on lots of levels, our experiences don\xe2\x80\x99t intersect on race. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say this: Watching Juliet confront the racism in white feminism and take room for herself was wonderful. All in all, I was charmed by this book. I laughed and I cried and I devoured it in a weekend. And I cannot wait to read whatever Gabby Rivera writes next.Lastly\xe2\x80\x94that cover? That cover is everything.

Juliet goes through so much learning and growth, which is already awesome, but what makes it such a fun story is her voice. Juliet is hilarious, maybe a bit confused and brash sometimes, but she\'s fierce and curious and isn\'t afraid to chase after what she wants--whether that\'s an internship with a white-feminist author, or a fling with a hot motorcycle-riding librarian. She\'s such a wonderful main character to read about and I absolutely adored following her and her journey. I\'d highly recommend Juliet Takes a Breath to so many people. If you read contemporary YA, you need to read this.A quick update: The edition (finished US ebook) that I read did not have the anti-Indigenous quotes that were discussed in older reviews (the passage was updated from what other reviewers had read), however this does not negate the treatment and silencing of Indigenous reviewers when they criticized Juliet Takes a Breath, nor does it negate the fact that anti-Indigenous sentiments existed in this book at one point in time. Although I did not find anything objectionable in the edition I read, I don\'t think this excuses the harm done to Indigenous people who gave honest critique and were silenced and never compensated for something that was changed in the final text.

Do you hear me, folks? 70% of the book is just a sequence of happenings that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand at all. It felt like the writer didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to tell the story. We have Juliet, who travelles to Portland to go to her favourite writer\xe2\x80\x99s house. Until here it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I mean it is totally relatable, but page by page, Juliet goes around Portland and basically does NOTHING expect for complain and praise Harlowe. The real plot starts a looooot of time later.\xe2\x80\xa2 If someone asked me about what emotion predominated in me while I was reading this book, I would say B-O-R-E-D-O-M. Most of the time I just felt like I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to read it, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t requested this title on NetGalley and if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hate DNFing books so much, I would have stopped reading Juliet Takes a Breath. The thing is, I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for any of the characters and I just wanted it to be over, as I could have started reading another book from my endless TBR. \xe2\x80\xa2 Harlowe\xe2\x80\x99s feminism isn\xe2\x80\x99t the one I have always known. Since when feminism is based on hating men, being weird (because Harlowe was HELLA weird) and masturbating?? I thought it was about genders equality. I\xe2\x80\x99m the fool, apparently. There were times when I liked Harlowe, but the times I hated her and just didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand a thing about she said were more. \xe2\x80\xa2 The characters\xe2\x80\x99 behaviour: from Juliet to almost EVERYONE. There is a part in the book where Juliet takes the bus, in Portland, and she complains about the scent \xe2\x80\x93that isn\xe2\x80\x99t flower\xe2\x80\x99s- that is in the bus. She says phrases like these \xe2\x80\x98In Portland do people wash? My mother has always told me to be clean!\xe2\x80\x99 Of course she has always said that?! Why does a person wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be clean? I\xe2\x80\x99m not even American, but I found it a little bit offensive to Portland people: in the buses there is no good scent since people have invented buses, not only Portland buses stink. Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m far away from Portland, and here buses are the same as Portland\xe2\x80\x99s. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the quote:       \xe2\x80\x9cSome of the men on the bus looked like normal white guys but their beards were thick, unkempt, and their T-shirts were yellowed from sweat. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand them. What kind of white people were they?\xe2\x80\x9d   So now white people have to be clean? This pratically doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. I assure you, my white classmates don\xe2\x80\x99t smell like flowers. To mention another character\xe2\x80\x99s beviour I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s mother. The only thing I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but feeling confused was where her mum let her go to a STRANGER\xe2\x80\x99s house in an another state. Like, what?! What if she is a killer?\xe2\x80\xa2 I found Juliet too much full of prejudices and annoying, to be honest. Also naive. She\xe2\x80\x99s 19 and in the whole book from the way she acted, she seemed much more younger. Also the fact she knows so little about her own country and about LGBT+ community. Look, I know this book is mainly about Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s trip to know everything about herself, about LGBT, but don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what a transgender is\xe2\x80\xa6 They are not aliens, so I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but wonder why Juliet was so much ignorant. \xe2\x80\xa2 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a negative or positive thing itself, it depens on what the point of view. For me, it was a negative. The thing I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about is that this book is really USA-centered. It is a negative thing because I\xe2\x80\x99m NOT an American, and because of that, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand such things. There is a lot of USA culture, which is okay to know, but it gets confusing to non-american people.\xe2\x80\xa2 Juliet is constantly watching EVERY GIRL she meets. When she has already a girlfriend. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate at all when she used poligamy to justificate the fact she liked others girls, beyond her girlfriend. NO.      LIKES:    \xe2\x80\xa2 This book is about a Latina! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read a book about a Latina since\xe2\x80\xa6 well, since never. It\xe2\x80\x99s always a good thing when in a book there is diversity and I LOVED how Juliet said a lot of words in Spanish, it made the whole thing more real. Although I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak if the author portrayed Latina culture as it has to because I\xe2\x80\x99m not Latina.  \xe2\x80\xa2 Juliet undertakes a journey in the LGBT+ community because, if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told you yet, she is a lesbian (more diversity,yay). She starts knowing herself and I found absolutely beautiful and amazing the way she discovers her personality, her sexuality and her just being a person in general. \xe2\x80\xa2 I just loved Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s family! Family, in this book, is an important topic and not only parents and siblings are present, but even aunts and cousins, which I just adored. In conclusion: This book wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for me, but it might work for you. I recommend reading it, especially if you are part of the LGBT+ community.  ...more                                                flag      42 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View all 8 comments                                                      Aug 23, 2021              theresa              rated it        really liked it                              Shelves:              lgbtq,               sapphic,               aoc,               loud-lesbians                                                this was powerful.                                                flag      31 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View 1 comment                                                      Mar 01, 2016              Dahlia                added it          &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;          review of another edition                              Shelves:              2016-releases,               ownvoices,               top-10-of-2016,               racial-diversity-in-ya-na,               lgbtqreads                                                I liked this so much.

It\'s so inclusive in a way that never feels tokenistic, even if it\'s not always 100% in its depiction. (There\'s one paragraph in which Juliet\'s at her aunt and uncle\'s, and her uncle is Jewish so they\'re eating Shabbat dinner, and it\'s just so cute. For the record, holding hands is totally a Christian thing and not a thing Jewish people do when we bless food, but like, just seeing the word Shabbat in a book is so freaking nice. Jewish rep is usually in the form, of, like, someone referring to their bat mitzvah money.) I don\'t wanna be that white girl who\'s like ALL WOMEN OF COLOR SHOULD READ THIS, but I will say that if you\'ve been desperately looking for #ownvoices QPoC rep in YA/NA, this is an excellent one to pick up, and I imagine it\'d be a pretty damn cathartic read for many. ETA: I will happily be that white girl that says ALL WHITE WOMEN SHOULD READ THIS. So, ALL WHITE WOMEN SHOULD READ THIS. Wanna understand the difference between white feminism and actual intersectionality? Hiiiiiii this should help.   ...more                                                flag      28 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View all 4 comments                                                      Apr 14, 2016              Naz (Read Diverse Books)              rated it        it was amazing          &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;          review of another edition                                              For an in-depth review, visit my blog.

What are your preferred gender pronouns?" [...] "I\'m sorry, what? How do I identify what?" [...] "Oh c\'mon, do you identify as queer? As a dyke? Are you trans?" he asked, spitting phrases at me, amused by my ignorance. "And PGPs are so important even though I think we should drop preferred and call them mandatory gender pronouns. So, are you she, he, ze, they?"- ""Lesbian, Bilitis, dyke;" Why didn\'t words for gay women ever sound beautiful?"- "...as a queer person, I have this opportunity to deconstruct and potentially abolish heteronormative relationship structures and create relationship models that work for me, that work for my needs and that don\'t rely on mimicking straight codes of conduct. Codes that often adhere to strict and archaic gender roles, imbalances of power, and this idea that one half of the relationship is in charge of the other. All of us have the radical power to enter into relationships based solely on honesty and respect with immeasurable reverence to sexual and emotional intimacy. We can decide whether we want to love one person for life, find a good thing with someone that opens itself up to several other love things with other beautiful humans, or something else entirely." - a lesbian character describing why she\'s polyamorous- "Know your period as you know yourself. Touch the wobbling blobs of blood and tissue that escape and land intact on your favorite period panties. Note the shades of brown and purple and volcanic reds that gush, spill, and squirt out announcing themselves. Slide fingers deep inside your cunt and learn what your period feels like before it\'s out of your body. Masturbate to ease cramps and meditate to soothe the spirit. Connect to your blood cycle. Build sacred rituals around your body during this time of renewal." - Harlowe Brisbane, in Raging Flower: Empowering Your Pussy by Empowering Your Mind Who says radical feminists have the license on vulva worship? \xf0\x9f\x98\x82 - The book expecting me to feel bad for Juliet after Lainie cheated on her, even though Juliet was fully intending to cheat on Lainie with the new girl she met at the library. No mention was made about discussing polyamory beforehand.- Nobody in this book has heard of the word "bisexual." Juliet\'s cousin says "I\'m basically attracted to everyone and lots of times no one at all. I don\'t think there\'s a word for that." There is. It\'s called bisexuality. Later on Juliet asks her aunt, now married to a man, if her fling with a woman in her youth was "just a phase" and her aunt replies "I don\'t know" and "I didn\'t have a name for it so I just let myself feel it." Once again, it\'s called bisexuality.- Juliet\'s cousin Ava saying that her problem with Harlowe\'s brand of white feminism with regard to her book is that she "didn\'t make queer and or trans women of color a priority in her work."Queers still haven\'t figured out that stringing together as many oppressed identities as they can think of doesn\'t create an argument. Harlowe is a lesbian and she writes about lesbianism. According to the queer logic that lumps together every non-heterosexual and non-traditional identity, Harlowe falls under the "queer" umbrella, so the complaint about her not prioritising "queer" women literally makes no sense. And it\'s clear from the comments of Ava and other characters that we\'re supposed to agree that women aren\'t allowed to write books about their bodies without paying homage to dick.- "I learned that a trans person was someone who was assigned the wrong gender by a doctor at birth."Doctors don\'t "assign" you a gender at birth, they observe and identify your sex.- "Ava talked about people I\'d never heard of like Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson. They were trans women of color and helped start the Stonewall Riots." Both of them were actually gay men in drag...and neither of them were even there when the riots started. Unsurprisingly, there\'s no mention of Storm\xc3\xa9 DeLarverie.- To the author\'s credit, she does mention the Daughters of Bilitis, a pre-Stonewall lesbian feminist group, but that doesn\'t make up for the heaps of factually incorrect information and misinformation that show she has little knowledge of gay and lesbian history (American or otherwise) and less mainstream branches of feminism (American or otherwise).- The book was written in 2016 but it takes place in 2003, which makes the gender nonsense at least a decade ahead of its time.- "Um, Ava, don\'t all women have vaginas?" I asked, staring at her."Fuck no. We just talked about this," she replied. "This is why I can\'t fuck with Harlowe. All Harlowe does is equate being a woman to bleeding and having certain body parts. Like, I\'m so not with that. For me, womanhood is radical enough for anyone who dares to claim it."What does this mean?- The most surprising thing about this book is that Harlowe herself isn\'t written as this "exclusionary" bad white feminist that everyone is meant to hate; I mean 98% of her dialogue is ridiculous but she\'s written as this weird but well-meaning hippie woman that Juliet admires, and who tries but makes mistakes.- There\'s very little storyline to speak of. The few things that could have been developed into something deeper and more interesting, like Juliet getting to know Kira, were overshadowed by the author whacking you over the head with gender and queer theory. Seriously, every character speaks as if they\'re reciting Tumblr posts.  ...more                                                flag      25 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View all 6 comments                                                      Mar 15, 2017              Elle (ellexamines)              rated it        really liked it                              Shelves:              y-2016releases,               4-star,               x-arcs,               humanity,               x-buylist,               z-2017reads,               she-did-that,               y-notowned,               contemporary,               authors-of-color                                                Thanks to the publisher for my netgalley arc!Let\xe2\x80\x99s get the negatives out of the way first: this book is fairly plotless.

Her emotional journey was easy to connect with, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will be for anyone who feels disenfranchised in society. This is Juliet\'s specific journey as a lesbian woman of color, and the author makes that very clear. Yet I was constantly impressed that Rivera managed to make this journey so specific yet so universal.The side characters shined here too. All were complex and developed, even in very little page time. I feel like I know these women. I feel like Gabby Rivera knows these women. I was just incredibly impressed by the amount I connected to this story. The integration of social issues here was also amazing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never read a book that represented so many issues so well. There\xe2\x80\x99s a focus on lgbt issues, on women\xe2\x80\x99s issues, on how women\xe2\x80\x99s issues and trans issues need to be connected, and on racism issues. It\xe2\x80\x99s revolutionary that this book got published by an agency. Juliet would be proud. I almost wish Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s brave women heroes had been integrated more into the latter half of the book. It seemed like an amazing concept that almost got abandoned. I understand why it happened, though; there was a lot to resolve in the latter half. Again, the pacing needed a little editing.

A very brief (and vague) summary:As a lesbian latinx woman from the Bronx, Juliet thinks she has a reasonable understanding of womanhood, queerness, and her identity as a woman of color. She arrives in Portland, Oregon for a summer internship with Harlow Brisbane\xe2\x80\x94the author of one of her favorite books, and resident feminist icon\xe2\x80\x94believing that working with her idol will help her to figure out her life, whatever that means. Once she arrives, though, Juliet realizes that neither Harlowe, Portland, or herself are quite what she imagined.That was a purposefully vague summary, because this is a very hard book to describe. It\xe2\x80\x99s largely plotless, which is something that often annoys me, but it worked perfectly in this case. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very character-based coming-of-age story about a girl learning to understand her own identity, and how she fits into the larger world. This is an internal book, one that focuses on personal experiences and challenging one\xe2\x80\x99s own preconceptions. Rivera\xe2\x80\x99s characters are flawed. They are problematic sometimes. They fuck up, they say offensive shit, but most importantly their words are challenged and they learn to know and be better. The entire book is super, super diverse\xe2\x80\x94the MC is lesbian and Puerto Rican, and literally almost every single other character is queer, poc, and/or female !!!! (This is also ownvoices rep, as the author herself is a queer latina woman. In an author\xe2\x80\x99s note, she states that much of Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s story was inspired by people or events in her own life.) There\xe2\x80\x99s also a Korean-American romantic interest, a poly relationship, queer female friendships, and multiple f/f romantic relationships (although the focus of this book is never really romance).There are multiple sections that include rather long explanations about sexuality, gender identity, feminism, and racial discrimination/microaggressions\xe2\x80\x94just to name a few of the issues this book tackles\xe2\x80\x94so it may come across as a little overexplanatory if you\xe2\x80\x99re already v familiar with these topics. I think they\xe2\x80\x99re all incorporated quite well into the story, though, and could potentially be super helpful for any readers who are just starting to understand these subjects. There were a few plot and character threads that seemed to pop up and disappear, like Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s projecting researching inspiring female figures, but overall I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have any major complaints about this. It was absolutely fantastic, and all I want is to run around gifting beautiful copies of it to every single person I know!!! I\xe2\x80\x99m realizing now that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t much of a mini review, but I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna cut myself off here bc if I let myself go on about this book for much longer I\xe2\x80\x99ll never get around to posting this review sooooooI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you with a few more lovely quotes:We are not damaged. We have suffered from the brutality of an inherently violent system that favors maleness over womanhood. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been victimized but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make us all victims. We\xe2\x80\x99re not the outcomes of what men have done to us. I refuse to be reduced to that.\xe2\x80\x9cYou are your own person, Juliet. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a phase, so what? If it\xe2\x80\x99s your whole life, who cares? You\xe2\x80\x99re destined to evolve and understand yourself in ways you never imagined before. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve got our blood running through your beautiful veins, so no matter what, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been blessed with the spirit of women who know how to love.\xe2\x80\x9dKiss everyone.

Always ask first and then kiss the way stars burn in the sky.I received an ARC from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.  ...more                                                flag      22 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review                                                              Jun 03, 2017              Danielle (Life of a Literary Nerd)              rated it        liked it                              Shelves:              contemporary,               standalones,               poc-main-character,               arcs,               lgbtq                                                3.5 Stars  Read everything you can push into your skull.

Juliet Takes a Breath is a moving and powerful story of self-discovery, growth, expectations, and feminism. Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s story felt so honest and raw, it truly captivates you as she learns to love herself.   Things I Liked:Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s journey is beautiful and powerful. I loved seeing her discover feminism, what it means to her, and where she fits into this larger movement. I also really loved that she learns from her family and she has a support system around her, ready to uplift and encourage her.  The feminist and queer ideologies are very accessible for every reader. Juliet learns and absorbs so much - about non-white revolutionists, polyamorous and other non-heteronormative relationships, safe spaces, trans rights, allies. Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are opened to a world she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know existed and she craves knowledge and understanding. Everything is explained very clearly and respectfully, so those new to feminism can easy understand the topics and grow in knowledge like Juliet. I also loved how Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with her mom developed. We see their relationship go through so much and in the end, her mom helps propel her forward, and encourages her to reinvent her own world and not rely on others to do so. I LOVED that they called out the white feminism EVERY TIME. The characters in the story were openly critical of the exclusionary and dismissive white feminist nonsense and actively challenged that white feminism was universal. It was just so great to see.   Things I Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Like:You already now I hated Harlowe. Everytime she was in a scene I just got angry - and don\xe2\x80\x99t even get me started on her dumbass book. First of all, it reminded me so much of the book Rachel reads in Friends-Be Your Own Windkeeper. I felt like they were basically interchangeable. On a more critical note, Raging Flower reeked of privilege. Highlighting women\xe2\x80\x99s divine essence and power, and their cosmic sisterhood, while not confronting any of the systemic or political oppression women - especially non-white women - face was infuriating. Yes camaraderie and self empowerment are important, but I HATED how Juliet upheld her book as a bastion of feminist literature and Harlowe was iconicized for her mediocrity. It was not unrealistic though, and Harlowe/her book was called out several times so I really appreciated that. I also HATED her half assed apology to Juliet after the incident at the book reading. She literally said she didn\xe2\x80\x99t think she said anything wrong or mean about Juliet and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.  I felt Juliet was very naive. I understand that this is the story of her journey to discover more about feminism and where she fit in, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like she was in college to me. She says she met Lainie in a Women\xe2\x80\x99s Studies class, but she still knew virtually nothing about feminism, or the fallacies of the US government, at all. It was a little unbelievable to me. I also didn\xe2\x80\x99t like her thoughts about the Native American genocide being an accident, and how Harlowe and Maxine\xe2\x80\x99s poly relationship meant her crushes on Kira and Maxine, while still loving Lainie, was okay - it felt like she was trying to justify emotionally cheating to me, while not being open with all parties. It was also hard for me to believe that Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s only resource on feminist literature was Raging Flower - even in Harlowe\xe2\x80\x99s book she says to read books and resources from a wide range of people, so I couldn\'t believe that Juliet hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken that advice to heart. This was a tough reading experience for me, but I am really happy I finished the book. Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s story is honest and gripping and unapologetically queer. Juliet celebrates the queerness in her own life and in the community she discovers. I loved going on this journey with Juliet and seeing her come into her own and learn to love who she is.I received a copy of the book from Riverdale Avenue Books via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.  ...more                                                flag      21 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View all 4 comments                                                      Jul 12, 2016              BrokenTune              rated it        it was amazing                              Shelves:              reviewed                                                4.5* - Not perfect, but I loved it.&quot;Feminism.

You know, besides Mom."When I first looked into picking up Juliet Takes a Breath, I came across a review that described this book as the female version of The Catcher in the Rye. My immediate reaction was "Oh, good grief, noooooo!" and I instantly wanted to cancel the sample that had just been delivered to my kindle.However, I read the first few pages and was kinda hooked by the voice of Juliet, a 19-year-old Latina, living in the Bronx. The book starts with Juliet writing a letter to the author of her favourite book, a book that she originally started reading as a joke, but that turned out to have such an impact on her that she started to question her view of life."I fall asleep with that book in my arms because words protect hearts and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got this ache in my chest that won\xe2\x80\x99t go away."I guess, this is where the similarities with Holden Caulfield start. But, really, this is also where they end. Where Holden dismisses the believes of others over his own somewhat narrow-minded ideas, which are based on his misinterpretation of the Burns poem (which he never really bothers to find out more about), Juliet wants to learn more about the ideas in the book that she regards as her "Bible" and manages to arrange an internship with its author.And so Juliet\'s huge road trip begins. She moves to Portland (OR) for the summer to help her author gather material for a new book, and by doing so learn more about herself, her family, her relationships with others, her place in the world, and as with all good coming-of-age stories, she learns that stories change depending on whose narrative is given a voice."Who were these women? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize any of their faces. How could I be 19 and not know any of them? I\xe2\x80\x99d always done all of my homework, read all of the books assigned in school and yet, here was a world full of possibly iconic ladies I knew nothing about."Unlike The Catcher in the Rye, which was a painful read because I mostly remember wanting to smack Holden with his own book, I could hardly wait to pick up Juliet Takes a Breath in my spare time. A couple of nights sleep may have suffered also, but it was such good fun reading this, that I really didn\'t mind.I\'m looking forward to more of Gabby Rivera\'s writing. "It made me wonder about all the ways that we are able to love each other and how movies and TV make it seem like you have to discard people once they break your heart or once the love disappears. Maybe that was a horrible lie, a complete disservice to real love."  ...more                                                flag      20 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review                                                              Jun 07, 2017              Xan                marked it as dnf                              Shelves:              latinx-author,               polyamory                                                DNF 4%I tried to read this book 5 times.

I just have so much love for it right now I wish I could walk up to Gabby Rivera and give her a damn tight hug as a thank you.If I\'d gotten my hands on this book a few years ago, when I was lost like Juliet about feminism and lgbt+ related subjects, it would\'ve been for me what Raging Flower was to her, but so much better. It felt like a love letter to latina lesbians. It is a fantastic book for girls in general, regardless of ethnicity, sexuality or gender, but as a latina lesbian, it felt like something special for girls like me, and that\'s not something we get very often. The way it was written, filled with terms and phrases in Spanish without much explanation or translations, the way these women spoke and joked about white people shit, and everything about Juliet\'s family \xe2\x80\x94 if I didn\'t already know the writer was a queer latina woman, I would\'ve guessed it by the time I reached the second chapter.Juliet Milagros Palante very easily earned her spot in my mental list of favorite protagonists ever. She was everything. She was dealing with so much at the same time throughout this story and I wanted to pull her into my arms and protect her, but also I knew she was going to be okay. Every chapter kept making me love her more just when I thought that wasn\'t possible. I don\'t know how to describe her other than saying she was so fucking real. Brave as hell but scared and vulnerable. Sometimes she\'d stand up for herself and sometimes she\'d cry on her cousin\'s shoulder, and she was so damn believable and relatable. Her determination on the quest of finding herself, her thirst for knowledge about her community and identity, her respect for new things that she didn\'t really understand just yet such as polyamory and gender pronouns, her love and admiration for the women that crossed her way, her adorable shyness around cute girls. Every part of her beautifully written personality was worth of praise.And I cannot remember the last time I read a book with such spectacular supporting characters. Every single one of them was wildly important to Juliet\'s journey, and at the same time, they made me wish desperately for new books where it\'s their turn to be the protagonist. And Ava, holy shit. At each of her appearances I\'d stop and hope from the bottom of my heart that Rivera will consider blessing me with a whole book about her story someday. When Juliet asked herself why she didn\'t go spend her summer with Ava in Miami instead, I nearly wept just thinking about how fucking fantastic that book would\'ve been as well. Ava warmed my heart with her love for Juliet and for queer people of color and her patience and care with Juliet\'s doubts and insecurities and her hilarious one-liners. Viva la revoluci\xc3\xb3n, Ava.Besides all of the stuff I\'ve mentioned above, this book was also a very entertaining and well written lesson on intersectional feminism. I was wary as hell of Harlowe\'s brand of hippy vagina-centric menstruation-loving feminism and some weird ass excerpts from her book, but from the very beginning, with the email Juliet wrote to her, I felt safe to believe it wasn\'t all going to be like that, and it was so delightful to be proven right. In the end, even Harlowe turned out to be an interesting, likeable character \xe2\x80\x94 flawed, but with good intentions and open-minded enough to listen and learn where her behavior needed fixing. Amongst the adult badass lesbians, though, Maxine was the real star for me, and Juliet\'s little crush on her was totally understandable. She and Zaria were so smart and wonderful and caring and, again, I want another book about them too. Along with Ava, and Kira, oh sweet loving Kira, they played the role of raising awareness to intersectionality and the importance of having spaces for people who really understand your struggles and not just preach about sisterhood.I was so excited when I noticed there was going to be some romance. I\'m a sucker for romantic storylines in pretty much everything, but I was ready to read this without any expectations for stuff like that, and then Kira showed up. I\'ll just say that, even if it wasn\'t the main focus of the story, Rivera writes fluffy romance damn well.I think I\'m done here. Short version: this book has the potential to be legitimately life-changing for girls in situations similar to Juliet\'s, and I hope they get the opportunity to read it.  ...more                                                flag      18 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View 1 comment                                                      May 04, 2017              Kate              rated it        it was ok                              Shelves:              ebooks,               arcs,               read-in-2017                                                2.25/5stars**I received this from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review**I had a LOT of problems with this book.I appreciate the ending, and if I hadn&apos;t completed this book I would have DNFed it with 1 star, but the ending had a discussion of a couple things I had problems with.

But, it didn\'t completely redeem it considering the author didn\'t make it clear at the beginning that these ideas that she was writing about weren\'t necessarily good.My biggest problem with this book was that, if I was a young girl reading about feminism for the first time in this novel, or a young lesbian girl reading about it for the first time, I would have a VERY swayed idea on what I was supposed to be thinking.In the first 75% of this novel we follow Juliet - a young, lesbian Latina girl who is obsessed with a book on Feminism and has gotten an internship with the author - Harlowe. The author is HORRIBLE - like, 99% of my issues with this book come from the author. Harlowe is racist, transphobic, man-hating and the most stereotypical "feminist" ever - but not actual feminist, the type of feminist most people think of and most people HATE. Harlowe believes that to be a woman you have to have a vagina and a menstrual cycle. Harlowe completely stereotypes Juliet as a latina girl "dodging bullets in the Bronx." And overall, throughout the first 3/4 of this novel, she\'s teaching Juliet how to be an angry, man hating "feminist."Like legit, this book was RIDICULOUS on how stereotypical it was being. Harlowe being so hippiedippy literally had me rolling my eyes every time she spoke, and how she seemed to think that hugging trees was going to fix Juliet\'s asthma and spiritual rituals and masturbation were the only ways to get rid of cramps. And omg she was so man hating I hated it so much I wanted to go into the book and strangle her.The book redeemed itself in the latter part where Juliet goes and visits her cousin and aunt who explain what being Transgender is, what preferred pronouns are, and that you don\'t need a label for everything - you don\'t have to be a crazy lesbian, or straight, or bi, or anything, you can just be yourself. And that was a FABULOUS message. BUT OF COURSE IT DOESN\'T MATTER THAT MUCH CAUSE JULIET GOES RIGHT BACK TO HARLOWE AND HER FUCKED UP FEMINISM.Also a few much less important aspects I hated: Juliet has asthma yet seemed to be smoking cigarettes and pot every time I turned around; why are all feminists in this book lesbians who are high 24/7; wtf was even the point of the character Phen at the beginning?; emotional cheating is still cheating I swear to fucking gosh I was about to scream; the conversation about religion half way through this book make me want to rip my hair out.Some parts that were redeemable about this book: the part with the cousin and aunt explaining things to Juliet; the writing in this book was pretty great; the conversation of feminism representing EVERYONE; own voices; basically just the conversation this book brings up is GREAT.I\'m not sure if I really recommend this book. I DEFINITELY would NOT recommend to people who are new to feminism of LGBT books because this one SUCKED. I guess go ahead and try reading it if you know a good deal about what you\'re getting into because this was some great own voices/diverse reading. but other than that... just no.  ...more                                                flag      18 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review        View 1 comment                                                      Sep 16, 2020              Anniek              rated it        it was ok                              Shelves:              1-2016-releases,               mc-of-colour,               latinx-mc,               latinx-author,               sapphic,               lgbtq,               author-of-colour,               2-ya,               3-contemporary                                                Read this in one sitting but it really wasn&apos;t for me as a non-binary reader.

At first it\'s endearing, but then later it becomes apparent that the book needed a little more editing. Also, some of the sentence structure seems as though it is not grammatically correct. When I first started the book, I was confused by the timing. It seemed as though boring days took up entire chapters, with characters that then left the book abruptly. However, as the book went on, the timing was similar to the pace I was expecting. I wish it was a little longer. The author was very descriptive about the main character\'s feelings, but not the overall plot development. I wish we had seen Juliet explore her romantic life a little more, especially in the beginning. The white feminism/Portland gets a little obnoxious in the beginning, but then you get used to it because the descriptions were accurate.Pros: I liked all of the characters. Even the ones that I didn\'t like. This was because each of them were just so dynamic. They taught me so much about how to view the world, and certain people\'s intentions. Juliet reminded me of myself, when I was first coming into my queerness. Hearing her describe certain things was touching. I remember when this world was so new and confusing. Reading a story about another QPOC was exactly what I needed this week, and it was touching. I found this book in the adult section, but it definitely reads as a teen book? I would recommend this book to people who are just learning about queer identity, or their own sexuality. Overall I liked this book.   ...more                                                flag      17 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review                                                              Oct 29, 2016              Book Riot Community                added it                                              During the Diverseathon, I decided that there couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any better book for me to pick up than Juliet Takes a Breath, which has been sitting on my shelf for far too long.

Well, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have worried. This is such a fantastic book about feminism, racism, sexuality, and coming of age. My favourite thing about it, though, is its recognition that people are complicated and flawed. You can have some things figured out and get other completely, devastatingly wrong. And it\xe2\x80\x99s up to us to decide which people are worth sticking with despite their fuck-ups and which people are toxic for us despite the things they get right. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s such an important and affirming thing to see in a book about social justice. And that\xe2\x80\x99s just a small part of this story. This is definitely one that will stick with me.\xe2\x80\x93Danika Ellisfrom The Best Books We Read in September 2016: http://bookriot.com/2016/10/03/riot-r...  ...more                                                flag      17 likes&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;Like&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;see review                                                              Apr 26, 2017              Renae              rated it        it was ok          &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;          review of another edition                              Shelves:              read-in-2017,               genre-contemporary-or-realistic                                                This book is doing so many great things.

She had scraped together what previous generations of trans women could only dream of: a life of mundane, bourgeois comforts. The only thing missing was a child. But then her girlfriend, Amy, detransitioned and became Ames, and everything fell apart. Now Reese is caught in a self-destructive pattern: avoiding her loneliness by sleeping with married men.\\Ames isn\\\'t happy either. He thought detransitioning to live as a man would make life easier, but that decision cost him his relationship with Reese\xe2\x80\x94and losing her meant losing his only family. Even though their romance is over, he longs to find a way back to her.
