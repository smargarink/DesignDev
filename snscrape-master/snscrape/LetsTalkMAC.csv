1492979788969086979,2022-02-13 21:51:34+00:00,I really do love what they did to America's costume in this. Feels so authentic to the comics and to the MCU in general. It works really well. https://t.co/D0GUD9m728

1492977148881252355,2022-02-13 21:41:05+00:00,@LetsTalkMAC It would actually be very interesting if Billy and Tommy are with Mother when they're found. Maybe America escaped and that's a connection?

A few explanations I can think of: La Legion (unlikely because of the source); the responsible can be the same that is currently affecting her powers in 616; and, the most likely imo, Mother from Young Avengers"
1492973854574231554,2022-02-13 21:27:59+00:00,@LetsTalkMAC Didn‚Äôt they just retcon this and ground her in the 616 universe ?
1492972934205431808,2022-02-13 21:24:20+00:00,@LetsTalkMAC So current retcon origin and maybe her powers are from some cosmic magical source after her?

1492937221921546244,2022-02-13 19:02:25+00:00,"Like, I am, in fact, not stupid, I understand there are out of universe reasons for why Bruce and Gotham are the way they are. My discussion is Watsonian in nature, to then extrapolate into the real world. It has very real merit."
1492937217970483215,2022-02-13 19:02:24+00:00,"I think some people are seeing this criticism as a reason why ""Batman wouldn't make sense"". That's not the case at all. Batman makes perfect sense, which it should be discussed critically."

1492894990288273408,2022-02-13 16:14:36+00:00,@LetsTalkMAC Also I see writers and reviewers CONSTANTLY saying that XYZ Batman story wants to be grounded in reality and real problems and injustice etc. But at the same time they don't want the criticism/discussion that comes with addressing these issues.
1492882430084227073,2022-02-13 15:24:42+00:00,"@LetsTalkMAC and activism. She's 'evil' and 'crazy.' She's a 'killer' (nevermind he's literally a man who dresses in an animal costume and uses violence, fear, and torture to wage his war on crime.)

There IS a message being sent there"
1492881752922206220,2022-02-13 15:22:00+00:00,"@LetsTalkMAC This is my problem with the situation. Bruce represents whiteness, the wealthy, the patriarchy. He's presented as intellectually and morally correct/honest, even among other heroes (he's always right).

While they vilify Ivy, who represents queerness, feminism, environmentalism,"
1492878870005137408,2022-02-13 15:10:33+00:00,"And I know the standard responses, I know that he donates money, I know that we're supposed to believe that Gotham is especially evil or whatever, but honestly, none of it matters. For as long as Bruce is a billionaire, he cannot effect real social change."
1492878867366879236,2022-02-13 15:10:32+00:00,"And to hail a billionaire as the only one who can save the city, not by distributing his wealth *in an effective way*, but by beating people up, is a problem. And is a relevant problem for our real life society today."
1492878865231978496,2022-02-13 15:10:32+00:00,"Again, this is not about *Bruce*, this is about understanding economic inequality. Gotham isn't the way it is because of the crime, the crime exists because of massive inequality."
1492878862975475716,2022-02-13 15:10:31+00:00,"I think it's important to point out that for Bruce Wayne to be a billionaire, he *has* to steal money from workers. Because that's how capitalism works. It doesn't matter how much money he donates or whatever, his mere existence makes Gotham less equal."
1492878860496642048,2022-02-13 15:10:31+00:00,"this isn't do dismiss Batman in particular, yall can wank Bruce for all I care. like, this is important shit. *Especially* when we currently have a large group of people who are praising a real life billionaire as a savior of our species."
1492878857271193604,2022-02-13 15:10:30+00:00,"""he's just a fictional character"" well, yeah, but one of the roles of fiction is being analyzed and criticized. Batman in particular can be a good way of discussing impact of wealth on disadvantaged communities, and our perception of what who can save them and how."
1492878855006212108,2022-02-13 15:10:30+00:00,Anti-capitalism Batman takes are and always will be valid and relevant

1468739581935816707,2021-12-09 00:29:38+00:00,"I still feel like America's arc is currently unfinished, and I'm betting we're gonna see it resolved sooner rather than later. At the very least she'll get her powers fixed, maybe find Catalina again"
1468738905063276546,2021-12-09 00:26:57+00:00,"This story is good, actually. Usually books like this don't offer a whole lot, but this is a good exploration of her character, and something that hasn't really been explored since Ultimates. I liked it."
1468737740065972227,2021-12-09 00:22:19+00:00,"I will say that if America has to be an Earth-based character, it makes so much more sense for her to be in NY than it did for her to be in LA. This feels right."
1468737289358659585,2021-12-09 00:20:32+00:00,Finally reading Marvel's Voices and it's definitely weird seeing the retcon being acknowledged outside of Made in America

MOM is supposed to be a cosmic-ish movie, so."
1390862001828728840,2021-05-08 02:51:56+00:00,@LetsTalkMAC That‚Äôs disappointing because she was awesome as a cosmic level hero in Ultimates. I really do dislike the need to  make the comics have synergy with the movies/television. It should be the other way around in terms of influence.

1390860369921519616,2021-05-08 02:45:27+00:00,it's kind of ooc for marvel to not already have a Kate series announced to meet mcu Hawkeye coming out later this year. have to imagine something's coming soon.
1390858334622867458,2021-05-08 02:37:22+00:00,It's not exactly a secret that I prefer America is a cosmic character? but maybe that ship's sailed now. I just hope Marvel has a plan for her now if they're really doing this.
1390858333100331014,2021-05-08 02:37:22+00:00,"I think it's fair to question where exactly America fits in the MU now. in the Ultimates/2017 era is felt like she was firmly a Cosmic character, but WCA/Made in the USA it seems like Marvel's deliberately's making her more of a street/avenger type of character."
1390855450778816514,2021-05-08 02:25:54+00:00,one thing about MAC being American is that she's so much closer to actually being a part of the capfam now. if only marvel just gave them a chance

Not because the character is terrible but because readers and everyone needed some time and distance from that book.

1390484053078446084,2021-05-07 01:50:06+00:00,Yo @Marvel I'm available to write the next retcon
1390483676014817285,2021-05-07 01:48:36+00:00,"What if whatever experiment America went through retroactively made the Utopian Parallel exist? What if America didnt actually daydream anything, and it was only an alternative reality of the facts? Maybe her imagination (and some help from Billy?) made it real."
1390471111633260544,2021-05-07 00:58:41+00:00,"@LetsTalkMAC @DavidLobefaro Despite some... questionable things the 2016 Solo book did, I see the potential in the character and hope things work out for the best for her."
1390469367712960518,2021-05-07 00:51:45+00:00,"@LetsTalkMAC I feel that the problems Rivera introduced were fixable and the UP had a lot of potential for exploration.

The retcon shuts off any possibility of exploration and expansion. The new origin feels like a limitation imo.

Throwing the UP out seems like a waste to me."
1390460841514913796,2021-05-07 00:17:52+00:00,"All things considered, I still think Wanda and Pietro had it worse than America, so hey, it could've been worse!"

1390458696002588674,2021-05-07 00:09:21+00:00,This is a good point that forgot to make on the thread I wrote this afternoon. America's original backstory is very original... in the Marvel universe. But it's also very similar to Superman's and Wonder Woman's. I still think the retcon could've been a little tighter tho. twitter.com/CrimsonPrince2‚Ä¶

The real question is, will this change lose her fans or gain more potential readers."

1390387211938537476,2021-05-06 19:25:18+00:00,"But we don't always get what we want, and the nature of comics is obviously very fluid. It's entirely possible that this retcon isn't true, or that isn't final, or that it'll revert back someday. Most longtime comic book characters have gone through similar changes."
1390387209820385284,2021-05-06 19:25:17+00:00,"Would I have done anything different? Probably, yeah. Including a white man in her origin is ill advised at best. If her mothers were human and had simply been trying to cure her and somehow ended up in the Parallel as we know it, I think everyone would've embraced the change."
1390387207714770945,2021-05-06 19:25:17+00:00,"We don't actually know a whole lot about America's role in the MCU as one right now, but we do have a leaked audition, and it's relevant to say that this audition aligns very well to what we know about America from Made in the USA. I highly doubt it's a coincidence."
1390387205751848961,2021-05-06 19:25:16+00:00,"But the longtime fans aren't the only fans that exist. America is already a part of the Rising franchise (and her origin there has many similarities with the retcon), and she'll be in the MCU starting next year. America is for those fans too."
1390387203784724484,2021-05-06 19:25:16+00:00,"Personally, I spent the entire day yesterday trying to figure out how I felt about it, what I liked and disliked. And I'm still not really sure? It's a major change to a character I love, I don't think myself or any of her longtime fans will assimilate everything any time soon."
1390387201616322560,2021-05-06 19:25:15+00:00,"It's impossible to say right now whether this retcon will ultimately be for the best or for the worst, we'll only really know years from now, or at the very least once Made in the USA is complete. I think it can be a positive change, if it's dealt with correctly."
1390387199594663944,2021-05-06 19:25:15+00:00,"And tbh, we can kinda see this already. There's a new influx of MAC fans that came with Made in the USA, that either never got America from her previous appearances or never had any interest in her. The response from new fans to the retcon has been largely positive."
1390387197518417934,2021-05-06 19:25:14+00:00,"People always had issues with that idea, myself included, but it's unquestionably a good thing that this is no longer a problem, and likely was THE big reason why the retcon exists in the first place. It makes America more palatable and more marketable to larger audiences."
1390387195182211072,2021-05-06 19:25:14+00:00,But it's not all bad news. This retcon solves the biggest criticism America's faced since her backstory was established. There was a line of thought that believed America wasn't actually Latine representation because she wasn't actually from Latin America. This has been fixed
1390387193173131264,2021-05-06 19:25:13+00:00,"Is America's relationship with the Demiurge still the same? Does it even exist? What about America's grandmother, Madrimar, and everything she told her in her solo? Is America no longer unique in the multiverse? probably not. Are Fuertonas still a thing? I hope not."
1390387191063498755,2021-05-06 19:25:13+00:00,"America's previous solo, America (2017) can be almost entirely discarded if this retcon is actually accurate. Everything that happened in that book would be either pure imagination, manipulation, or just isn't canon anymore (some people find this a positive thing)."
1390387188949467140,2021-05-06 19:25:12+00:00,"There's also the question of everything that came before Made in the USA. Many of America's stories before this book link her directly to the multiverse, to her heritage, and to her mothers' sacrifice. It's valid to wonder if that has any meaning anymore."
1390387186902700034,2021-05-06 19:25:12+00:00,"Is this retcon a good or a bad thing? It depends. Most America fans don't seem to like it. The main argument is that this makes America's origin less original. And indeed, I was talking to @SpiderWomnDaily and the similarities of this origin to Jessica Drew's are many, for one"
1390387184914599936,2021-05-06 19:25:11+00:00,"In fact, not of this has actually been confirmed as truth. Made in the USA is an ongoing book and we don't have all the answers. A lot can change between now and the time the final issue comes out, likely in August, but for now, we can speculate."
1390387180963614720,2021-05-06 19:25:10+00:00,"Right now we believe that this experiment, that supposedly exposed America to a magical multidimensional magic is what gave her powers. That hasn't been entirely confirmed. https://t.co/GiwQCndAEK"

It's overly complex and very few people actually give a shit about it, so I dont see why marvel would bother. also the leaked audition may have nothing to do with what will happen in the movie, but based on what we learned from it, shes a different MAC"
1362510255280824325,2021-02-18 21:12:13+00:00,It's very likely not the case but it's still possible that the reason why MAC will be younger in DS is because we're dealing with a younger version of the America we know from the comics. They would be able to keep everything canon if they tried something like that

1332765061316825096,2020-11-28 19:15:26+00:00,It definitely makes sense to have someone from America's birthplace be the antagonist in a book about her origin. The question is how they're going to use her

Both Miles &amp; the Gwen books should've ended ages ago when the original runs ended &amp; the creators left. In Miles's case it should've ended about 3 years before Bendis decided he was finished"

So many people think she's just about looking badass and punching stuff and not letting anybody in (Rising), but she's so much more than that https://t.co/RVhC5cTfsh"
1166881789916385280,2019-08-29 01:14:32+00:00,"(which is what makes all the cap-related characters special, jsyk. what they believe in changes from character to character, but the conviction is always there)"

This right here is what makes America a great character, this is why she works. Because yeah, she's tough and reckless and a bit aggressive, but she fights because she believes in something"
1166881783788580876,2019-08-29 01:14:31+00:00,"lemme separate this panel in two tweets. first of all, this still is one of the first times America's kissed on panel.

Also, this surprisingly isn't a take that comes up often in America's stories, but it should. I'm glad JerWhit added it. https://t.co/MM77VYWl4m"
1166881757267935234,2019-08-29 01:14:25+00:00,"this is the one bit I do kind of disagree on, America was seen praying before and clearly the Demiurge was very important to her, but I'm willing to accept an interpretation that argues she lost some of that after meeting Billy and Sanar &amp; Berraca https://t.co/h8upvItuqE"
1166881742751444992,2019-08-29 01:14:21+00:00,A lot of people question why America's considered a Latina superhero or a representation of Latinxs everywhere. This is why. MAC embodies the shared Latinx culture better than any other hero I've seen (except maybe for el chapulin colorado) https://t.co/pCDDMzbHcX
1166881726850895873,2019-08-29 01:14:17+00:00,also what America is wearing looks very similar to her second costume in America #1 and I love it https://t.co/s7UBaEzSSX
1166881697457213441,2019-08-29 01:14:10+00:00,"This is also new and also a welcome addition. We've seen America first getting to 616 twice before and she didn't seem to have much trouble with the journey. This gives more weight to what she does, if it even needed it. https://t.co/Mnjum2M413"
1166881686145130497,2019-08-29 01:14:08+00:00,the characterization is just on point. america's reckless! she's eager to save people! she doesn't have time to think about consequences!! https://t.co/ScISyGO1Xz
1166881674229141504,2019-08-29 01:14:05+00:00,"I might be wrong, but I think this is the first time America talks about what happened as an 'attack' against the parallel instead of something that just happened. I actually kinda prefer it like this? it could give her some great storylines going forward https://t.co/w8SVAQu1FH"
1166881661147078661,2019-08-29 01:14:02+00:00,"This is absolutely perfect. The thing is, what happened to America Was a tragedy, she lost her mothers when she was a child, but she never saw it that way. Her mothers are her inspiration, she wants to be like them. https://t.co/G5uXgbbMS0"
1166881652724965376,2019-08-29 01:14:00+00:00,"(I'm still more than ready for America to get a new costume or wear the one from America #1, but for this story specifically, it had to be this one, so no complaints from me)"
1166881649105223681,2019-08-29 01:13:59+00:00,"I also love the way she looks in this. Easily one of, if not the best looking America's we've had so far. We've had a hard time lately with artists not respecting her body shape lately, but Irene nails it"
1166881645389127681,2019-08-29 01:13:58+00:00,"Starting from the very beginning, I /love/ that title. It's so representative from MAC's best moments in comics so far and should definitely be a mission statement for her character going forward."

1114927968848162816,2019-04-07 16:28:36+00:00,"well shit, would you look at that. it's almost as if I know what I'm talking about https://t.co/JY79GvC2vZ"
1114927557621813250,2019-04-07 16:26:58+00:00,"saying the queer community is ""too inclusive"" is opening your arms to terfs, biphobics and acephobics and that's something you never, ever want to do."
1114923880437645314,2019-04-07 16:12:22+00:00,10. First because she's looking for some answers that she might not find at home and second because she stumbled upon power and she wants to use that power to protect everything she loves. she has a really strong sense of duty and it appeals to that.
1114923387510456321,2019-04-07 16:10:24+00:00,"9. As if it couldn't be any more obvious, she's Lawful Good. Leans more towards goodness than lawfulness but things like society, rules, and tradition most of all mean a lot to her. being a Dwarf has a big impact on that"
1114922814333706243,2019-04-07 16:08:07+00:00,"8. Her main goal is to know more about her family's history and their connection to Arcane magic, and eventually use what she finds to protect all the goodness in the world."
1114921946267955200,2019-04-07 16:04:40+00:00,"7. Elrin is the kind of character who genuinely thinks everyone is her friend, but she tends to make an extra effort to be close to closed off people, which can go really badly real fast tbqh"

1114898481049755649,2019-04-07 14:31:26+00:00,do y'll ever feel like reading more about a character but you've already read every major appearance they've made in 40ish years cause same
1114893096699953152,2019-04-07 14:10:02+00:00,and this is a reminder that JerWhit once wrote this twitter.com/jrome58/status‚Ä¶
1114891115927351296,2019-04-07 14:02:10+00:00,this is a reminder to buy the shit out of UWU #7
1114890968925450241,2019-04-07 14:01:35+00:00,but anyway! over/under how many times do y'all think JerWhit's gonna let America call Kate 'princess' in UWU #7
1114889179404673024,2019-04-07 13:54:28+00:00,people like myself should always be watching themselves and thinking about what they're doing on the internet. it's another toxic behavior that we learned that have to be fixed like any other.
1114889178205040646,2019-04-07 13:54:28+00:00,and that's just the tip of the iceberg. back in 2011/2012 the most popular tumblr roleplays were either about underage sex or actual sexual slavery. it was EVERYWHERE. and you can still find some many people still holding on to that and writing it on open spaces because they can
1114889176942555136,2019-04-07 13:54:28+00:00,"like, I'm from a time when saying you shouldn't pirate stuff on the internet was literally a joke. like, the thought of PAYING for anything was ridiculous."
1114886611920138240,2019-04-07 13:44:16+00:00,"and that's not an excuse to anyone's behavior. we all should know so much better at this point and if we don't, we should be called out on it so this can be fixed"
1114886236072755200,2019-04-07 13:42:46+00:00,"like, we spent so much time in a place where you could just do anything and watched other people do anything that it kinda fucked up our sense of what SHOULD be allowed to be done. it's a serious problem"
1114886235028430848,2019-04-07 13:42:46+00:00,myself included tbh
1114886233799430149,2019-04-07 13:42:46+00:00,growing up in a time where the internet had no rules or oversight whatsoever had such a negative impact in so many older millennials

1106969821667840001,2019-03-16 17:25:46+00:00,it's exactly the same thing with Superman. why would an alien give a shit about the American way? because he was raised in the US by Americans and learned to love it. he is and always has been a part of it.
1106968913290686465,2019-03-16 17:22:10+00:00,"and to me, personally, that's what makes us Latinx more than anything else. it's living in our culture, understanding it, going through the ups and downs of being Latinx. and no one can deny that MAC does that as well as anyone in the MU."
1106968911961116673,2019-03-16 17:22:09+00:00,"it was explained in her solo that the culture of her people is based on Latin American culture, and after she left, at 6 years old, she lived with a Nuyorican family before traveling all across Latin America on her own. there's enough there to justify the connection imo"

1106958835036684288,2019-03-16 16:42:07+00:00,"@Tuckerscreator I think changing Madrimar's story would only affect Madrimar herself (which is valid, but I'm not exactly dying to give her more panel time). As for the Utopia, I mean, it's Heaven. The fact that America left speaks a lot more about her than anyone who stayed."
1106957221529817088,2019-03-16 16:35:42+00:00,"Time progression in the MU is always weird, but it's not crazy to assume America would be around 10 when the Power Pack first got their powers and now I'm here, emotional at the idea of her and Julie meeting each other as kid superheroes and forming a bond."
1106957177439174656,2019-03-16 16:35:32+00:00,"@LetsTalkMAC I‚Äôd like to see her origin examined with a little more ambiguity. Maybe a take on Madrimar could‚Äôve been that she‚Äôs been looking for Mac trying to take her back home, but has to examine why Utopia‚Äôs been withdrawn from the worlds and only a kid tried to help anyone."
1106956169212506112,2019-03-16 16:31:31+00:00,"@Tuckerscreator I think about that a lot, yeah. My take is that it speaks volumes of their interactions in the last two issues, even tho they did had some nice small moments before that.

And being alone as a child is always cruel and terrifying. There's no way around it."
1106954824619220992,2019-03-16 16:26:11+00:00,"@LetsTalkMAC It‚Äôs odd in retrospect that Amerikate spawned out of this series considering they only interact a handful of times.

1106925447760277504,2019-03-16 14:29:27+00:00,"A few of my own:
-Teddy deserves a lot more love from the fandom. he's a lot more interesting than we give him credit for
-Going back to being Young Avengers after being on another Avengers team isn't a demotion, it's just going back home
-They're too powerful for their own good"

1093870829560049664,2019-02-08 13:55:03+00:00,@TalkRachelGrey @LetsTalkMAC @JewishSpeed A team of the youngest superheroes! I'd love that. They are kids but I wouldn't mess with them.
1093865826732650498,2019-02-08 13:35:10+00:00,@LetsTalkMAC I thought her hair was different. She looks more like America than Riri to me.
1093845346592219136,2019-02-08 12:13:47+00:00,@LetsTalkMock @LetsVenom @Talkchampions yup. when I read Spiderverse and Spider-women I could swear she was younger than Gwen because of the way she behaved. even the art in her solo books (which I love btw) do work in the favor of making her feel younger. Marvel should just find a way to de-age her and work from there
1093844402034917376,2019-02-08 12:10:02+00:00,"@LetsTalkMAC @LetsVenom @Talkchampions They do treat her like a teenager a lot, and it's really weird. Like, yeah, she should be a little behind in social development because she didn't interact with anyone from the ages 16-28 or whatever, but that doesn't mean she's literally a kid."
1093842216794103811,2019-02-08 12:01:21+00:00,"@hulknaps yeah, this design was actually good, but what we got has absolutely nothing to do with it. it's just incredibly disappointing. Rising could've been really special"

1093840132019490816,2019-02-08 11:53:04+00:00,@LetsTalkMAC Its weird bc on the original art they released she looked a lot more like riri and that was completely lost? The loop earrings rly arent for her https://t.co/2omdQ6gM4X
1093839227274567682,2019-02-08 11:49:28+00:00,what the FUCK is the point of having a cast of characters as diverse as Marvel Rising has and try to hide that away in every opportunity they have? Why bring all these characters together when you care so little for them? Fuck Marvel Rising imho
1093839225890488320,2019-02-08 11:49:28+00:00,and that's not even getting into how much more feminine Riri looks compared to the comics. That's just not who Riri is.
1093839224573493249,2019-02-08 11:49:28+00:00,this is straight it up colorism on Marvel Rising's side. there's really nothing else that could be said. what reason did the animators have to change her character? because it's easier to draw? that's bullshit. Marvel Rising is just incredibly disappointing.
1093839223428444162,2019-02-08 11:49:28+00:00,"there are little girls who look like Riri, the actual Riri, that could've had the opportunity of seeing themselves on screen as one of the coolest new marvel characters. But they straightened her hair and lightened her skin."
1093839222153318405,2019-02-08 11:49:27+00:00,"lemme come back to this real quick. it's one thing to get America's origin wrong, I'll get over it, whatever. it's another Completely different thing to do this to Riri. This kind of design is Harmful."

1068209995999662080,2018-11-29 18:28:04+00:00,@LetsTalkJune Isn't that young Jason in a nutshell tho haha. And I'm speaking from a place of love
1068209667631996934,2018-11-29 18:26:45+00:00,@LetsTalkMAC Yeah she is pretty different from the comics maybe that's why I like her better lol I still have the challenge of enjoying deanoru in S2.

Comics Nico is defined by how much she screws up and still wants to do the right thing regardless. she's very, very complex, and the show barely touches on it. Also changing how the staff works, tho understandable, removes the self harm metaphor"

1068208209733795846,2018-11-29 18:20:58+00:00,I should make a new Lets Talk so I could talk about All the young marvel heroes and gush about the runaways and the champions and the avengers academy more often but that would require effort

1068202398278184960,2018-11-29 17:57:52+00:00,@LetsTalkMAC Nothing will make me stop loving and supporting her. It's sad to see what King is doing and I don't see the point of HiC. DC should have released a new GCS instead of throwing Harley into that book.

I'm betting the simulation tech plays into both the differing of Booster and Harley's experiences while also backdooring at least a few characters' survival.
1068044538160209920,2018-11-29 07:30:35+00:00,@LetsTalkBishop @LetsTalkMAC @LetsTalkWest The idea of a superhero murder mystery is interesting. Pairing it with superhero PTSD stuff moreso. And so far we've had hints of direction that make me confident this doesn't end with Jean Loring murdered her best friend to make her ex husband love her again so that's a plus.
1068044073901015040,2018-11-29 07:28:45+00:00,"@LetsTalkBishop @LetsTalkMAC @LetsTalkWest I have such mixed feelings because I actually like the story so far and understand why it's been laid out like it has but it's hard to sell me that a mass killing of characters isn't wasteful, nevermind my personal biases as Wally is like my second or third favourite in comics."

1060250262932217861,2018-11-07 19:18:55+00:00,@LetsTalkMAC Hard to say how stationary she was though. Her having a motorcycle already hints she might‚Äôve traveled a lot.
1060250087664902144,2018-11-07 19:18:14+00:00,America's thighs look üëåüëåüëåüëå on Marvel Rising tho I'll give them that
1060249855455625218,2018-11-07 19:17:18+00:00,@LetsTalkMAC I mean she still made the decision to fight and help her Mom‚Äôs they just didn‚Äôt want her to endanger herself etc... and yeah she resented them at first for it but she came around.
1060249685514948608,2018-11-07 19:16:38+00:00,@letstalktommie also America is ultimately a traveler. she's been on the move since she was 6 and she knows everything about everywhere. it's a major part of her identity as a hero. a stationary Amerixa just doesn't feel the same
1060249280915689474,2018-11-07 19:15:01+00:00,"@letstalktommie not quite. America makes a choice in the comics. she could've stayed in the parallel and have a good life, but she decides to leave to make her mothers proud. not only this America didn't make that choice, she avoided fighting and resented her moms for saving her."
1060247006269071361,2018-11-07 19:05:59+00:00,America's characterization in this feels like someone only read vengeance and thought it was the only thing they needed to know about her. it hurts a lot.

1060246107714920448,2018-11-07 19:02:25+00:00,I'll say that the one thing they got right was America's moms and them being her main motivation but ugh. this can't be canon
