BlerDcon is a convention — the event’s name signals that it specifically caters to blerds (black nerds), BlerDCon is an inclusive space for all POC, LGBTQ+, female, and disabled fans. Pulling data from the 2021 convention, I seek to gather more information and insight into the topics dicussed around this venue and the sentiments of the participants. \n",
