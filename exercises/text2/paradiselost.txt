I may mention in passing that, to prevent miscon- \rception, I avoided consulting at all the Milton Lexicon \rpublished recently by another American student. On the \rother hand, I have used with much profit the scholarly and \rexhaustive dictionary of The Classical Mythology of Milton\'s \rEnglish Poems, by Mr C. G. Osgood, one of those fine \rstudies in English literature for which we have to thank the \rUniversity of Yale. \r\rThe extracts from the Milton MSS. are quoted (without, \rof course, any modernisation) from the beautiful facsimile \rpublished by the University Press, under the editorship of \rthe Vice-Master of Trinity College. The textual variations \rare shown so simply by the editor\'s very ingenious typo- \rgraphical arrangement that the work of collating is practically \rdone away. \r\rThe extracts from Milton\'s prose works are taken from \rthe edition published in "Bonn\'s Standard Library." Apart \rfrom my general indebtedness to this edition, I must note \rthat its footnotes are the source of many of my references to \rMilton\'s Christian Doctrine. \r\rAll the translations of passages from Dante, and most of \rthe Dante information, come from the editions of the \r"Temple" series.

L. \r\r\r\rINTRODUCTION \r\r\r\rLIFE OF MILTON. \r\rMILTON\'S life falls into three clearly defined divisions. The \rfirst period ends with the poet\'s return from Italy in 1639; the \rsecond at the Restoration in 1660, when release from the fetters \rof politics enabled him to remind the world that he was a great \rpoet ; the third is brought to a close with his death in 1674. \rParadise Lost belongs to the last of these periods ; but we \rpropose to summarise briefly the main events of all three. \r\rJohn Milton was born on December 9, 1608, in London. He \rcame, in his own words, ex genere honesto. A family of Miltons \rhad been settled in Oxfordshire since the reign of Elizabeth. \rThe poet\'s father had been educated at an Oxford school, possibly \ras a chorister in one of the College choir-schools, and imbibing \rAnglican sympathies had conformed to the Established Church. \rFor this he was disinherited by his Roman Catholic father. He \rsettled in London, following the profession of scrivener. A \rscrivener combined the occupations of lawyer and law-stationer. \rIt appears to have been a lucrative calling ; certainly John Milton \r(the poet was named after the father) attained to easy circum- \rstances. He married about 1600, and had six children, of \rwhom several died young. The third child was the poet. \r\rThe elder Milton was evidently a man of considerable \rculture, in particular an accomplished musician, and a com- \rposer whose madrigals were deemed worthy of being printed \rside by side with those of Byrd, Orlando Gibbons and other \rleading musicians of the time. To him, no doubt, the poet \rowed the love of music of which we see frequent indications in \r\r\r\rXli INTRODUCTION. \r\rthe poems 1 . Realising, too, that in his son lay the promise \rand possibility of future greatness, John Milton took the utmost \rpains to have the boy adequately educated ; and the lines Ad \rPatrem show that the ties of affection between father and child \rwere of more than ordinary closeness. \r\rMilton was sent to St Paul\'s School about the year 1620. \rHere two influences, apart from those of ordinary school-life, may \rhave affected him particularly. The headmaster was a good \rEnglish scholar ; he published a grammar containing many \rextracts from English poets, notably Spenser ; it is reasonable \rto assume that he had not a little to do with the encouragement \rand guidance of Milton\'s early taste for English poetry 2 . Also, \rthe founder of St Paul\'s School, Colet, had prescribed as part \rof the school-course the study of certain early Christian writers, \rwhose influence is said to be directly traceable in Milton\'s poems \rand may in some cases have suggested his choice of sacred \rthemes 2 . While at St Paul\'s, Milton also had a tutor at home, \rThomas Young, a Scotchman, afterwards an eminent Puritan \rdivine the inspirer, doubtless, of much of his pupil\'s Puritan \rsympathies. And Milton enjoyed the signal advantage of \rgrowing up in the stimulating atmosphere of cultured home-life. \rMost men do not realise that the word \'culture\' signifies \ranything very definite or desirable before they pass to the \rUniversity; for Milton, however, home-life meant, from the \rfirst, not only broad interests and refinement, but active \rencouragement towards literature and study. In 1625 he left \rSt Paul\'s. Of his extant English poems 3 only one, On the \r\r1 Milton was very fond of the organ; see // Penseroso, 161, note. \rDuring his residence at Horton Milton made occasional journeys to \rLondon to hear, and obtain instruction (probably from Henry Lawes) \rin, music. It was an age of great musical development. See "Milton\'s \rKnowledge of Music" by Mr W. H. Hadow, in Milton Memorial \rLedtirts (1908). \r\r2 See the paper "Milton as Schoolboy and Schoolmaster" by \rMr A. F. Leach, read before the British Academy, Dec. 10, 1908. \r\r3 His paraphrases of Psalms cxiv. cxxxvi. scarcely come under this \rheading. Aubrey says in his quaint Life of Milton: "Anno Domini \r1619 he was ten yeares old, as by his picture [the portrait by Cornelius \rJansen] : and was then a poet." \r\r\r\rLIFE OF MILTON. Xlll \r\rDeath of a Fair Infant, dates from his school-days ; but we are \rtold that he had written much verse, English and Latin. And \rhis early training had done that which was all-important : it had \rlaid the foundation of the far-ranging knowledge which makes \rParadise Lost unique for diversity of suggestion and interest. \r\rMilton went to Christ\'s College, Cambridge, in the Easter \rterm of 1625, took his B.A. degree in 1629, proceeded M.A. in \r1632, and in the latter year left Cambridge. The popular view \rof Milton\'s connection with the University will be coloured for \rall time by Johnson\'s unfortunate story that for some unknown \' \roffence he " suffered the public indignity of corporal correction." \rFor various reasons this story is now discredited by the best \rjudges. It is certain, however, that early in 1626 Milton did have \rsome serious difficulty with his tutor, which led to his removal \rfrom Cambridge for a few weeks and his transference to another \rtutor on his return later in the term. He spoke of the incident \rbitterly at the time in one of his Latin poems, and he spoke of \rCambridge bitterly in after years. On the other hand he \rvoluntarily passed seven years at the University, and resented \rstrongly the imputations brought against him in the " Smectym- \rnuus" controversy that he had been in ill-favour with the \rauthorities s ^^4iis_j:ollege. Writing in 1642, he takes the \ropportunity "to acknowledge publicly with all grateful mind, \rthat more than ordinary favour and respect, which I found above \rany of my equals at the hands of those courteous and learned \rmen, the fellows of that college wherein I spent some years : who \rat my parting, after I had taken two degrees, as the manner is, \rsignified many ways how much better it would content them \rthat I would stay ; as by many letters full of kindness and loving \rrespect, both before that time, and long after, I was assured of \rtheir singular good affection towards me 1 ." And if we look into \rthose uncomplimentary allusions to Cambridge which date from \rthe controversial period of his life we see that the feeling they \r\r1 An Apology for Smectymmms, P. W. III. in. Perhaps Cambridge \rwould have been more congenial to Milton had he been sent to Emmanuel \rCollege, long a centre of Puritanism. Dr John Preston, then Master \rof the college, was a noted leader of the Puritan party. \r\r\r\rxiv INTRODUCTION. \r\rrepresent is hardly more than a phase of his theological bias. \rHe detested ecclesiasticism, and for him the two Universities \r(there is a fine impartiality in his diatribes) are the strongholds \rof what he detested : " nurseries of superstition " " not yet well \rrecovered from the scholastic grossness of barbarous ages" \rgiven up to "monkish and miserable sophistry," and unpro- \rgressive in their educational methods. But it may fairly be \rassumed that Milton the scholar and poet, who chose to spend \rseven years at Cambridge, owed to her more than Milton the \rfierce controversialist admitted or knew. A poet he had proved \rhimself before leaving the University in 1632. The short but \rexquisite ode At a Solemn Music^ and the Nativity Hymn \r(1629), were already written. \r\rMilton\'s father had settled at Horton in Buckinghamshire. \rThither the son retired in July, 1632. He had gone to Cambridge \rwith the intention of qualifying for some profession, perhaps the \rChurch 1 : This purpose was soon given up, and when Milton \rreturned to his father\'s house he seems to have made up his \rmind that there was no profession which he cared to enter. He \rwould choose the better part of studying and preparing himseli, \rby rigorous self-discipline and application, for the far-off divine \revent to which his whole life moved. \r\rIt was Milton\'s constant resolve to achieve something that \rshould vindicate the ways of God to men, something great that \rshould justify his own possession of unique powers powers of \rwhich, with no trace of egotism, he proclaims himself proudly \rconscious. The feeling finds repeated expression in his prose ; \rit is the guiding-star that shines clear and steadfast even through \rthe mists of politics. He has a mission to fulfil, a purpose \rto accomplish, no less than the most fanatic of religious en- \rthusiasts ; and the means whereby this end is to be attained are \r\r1 Cf. Milton\'s own words : " the church, to whose service, by the \rintentions of my parents and friends, I was destined of a child, and \rin my own resolutions" (The Reason of Church Government, P. W. \rII. 482). What kept him from taking orders was primarily his \robjection to Church discipline and government : he spoke of himself \ras " Church-outed by the prelates." \r\r\r\rLIFE OF MILTON. XV \r\rdevotion to religion, devotion to learning, and ascetic purity \r\rof life. \r\rThis period of self-centred isolation lasted from 1632 to 1638. \rGibbon tells us among the many wise things contained in that \rmost wise book the Autobiography, that every man has two \reducations : that which he receives from his teachers and that \rwhich he owes to himself ; the latter being infinitely the more \rimportant. During these five years Milton completed his \rsecond education ; ranging the whole world of classical 1 anti- \rquity and absorbing the classical genius so thoroughly that \rthe ancients were to him what they afterwards became to \rLandor, what they have never become to any other English \rpoet in the same degree, even as the very breath of his being ; \rpursuing, too, other interests, such as music, astronomy 2 and \rthe study of Italian literature; and combining these vast \rand diverse influences into a splendid equipment of hard-won, \rwell-ordered culture. The world has known many greater \rscholars in the technical, limited sense than Milton, but few \rmen, if any, who have mastered more things worth mastering \rin art, letters and scholarship 3 . It says much for the poet that \r\r1 He was closely familiar too with post-classical writers like Philo \rand the neo-Platonists ; nor must we forget the mediaeval element in \rhis learning, due often to Rabbinical teaching. \r\r2 Science " natural philosophy," as he terms it is one of the \rbranches of study advocated in his treatise On Education. Of his \rearly interest in astronomy there is a reminiscence in Paradise Lost, \rII. 70811; where "Milton is not referring to an imaginary comet, \rbut to one which actually did appear when he was a boy of 10 (1618), \rin the constellation called Ophiuchus. It was of enormous size, the \rtail being recorded as longer even than that of 1858. It was held \rresponsible by educated and learned men of the day for disasters. \rEvelyn says in his diary, \'The effects of that comet, 1618, still working \rin the prodigious revolutions now beginning in Europe, especially in \rGermany\'" (Professor Ray Lankester). \r\r3 Milton\'s poems with their undercurrent of perpetual allusion are \rthe best proof of the width of his reading ; but interesting supplementary \revidence is afforded by the Common-place Book discovered in 1874, and \rprinted by the Camden Society, 1876. It contains extracts from about \r80 different authors whose works Milton had studied. The entries seem \rto have been made in the period 163746. \r\r\r\rXVI INTRODUCTION. \r\rhe was sustained through this period of study, pursued ohne \rHast, ohne Rast, by the full consciousness that all would be \rcrowned by a masterpiece which should add one more testi- \rmony to the belief in that God who ordains the fates of men. \rIt says also a very great deal for the father who suffered his \rson to follow in this manner the path of learning. \r\rTrue, Milton gave more than one earnest of his future fame. \rThe dates of the early pieces D Allegro, II Penseroso, Arcades, \rCounts and Lycidas are not all certain ; but probably each was \rcomposed at Horton before 1638. Four of them have great \rautobiographic value as an indirect commentary, written from \rMilton\'s coign of seclusion, upon the moral crisis through which \rEnglish life and thought were passing, the clash between the \rcareless hedonism of the Cavalier world and the deepening \rausterity of Puritanism. In LlAllegro the poet holds the \rbalance almost equal between the two opposing tendencies. In \r// Penseroso it becomes clear to which side his sympathies are \rleaning. Comus is a covert prophecy of the downfall of the \rCourt-party, while Lycidas openly "foretells the mine" of the \rEstablished Church. The latter poem is the final utterance of \rMilton\'s lyric genius. Here he reaches, in Mr Mark Pattison\'s \rwords, the high-water mark of English verse ; and then the \rpity of it he resigns that place among the lyrici vates of which \rthe Roman singer was ambitious, and for nearly twenty years \rsuffers his lyre to hang mute and rusty in the temple of the \rMuses. \r\rThe composition of Lycidas may be assigned to the year \r1637. In the spring of the next year Milton started for Italy. \rIt was natural that he should seek inspiration in the land where \rmany English poets, from Chaucer to Shelley, have found it. \rMilton remained abroad some fifteen months. Originally he \rhad intended to include Sicily and Greece in his travels, but \rnews of the troubles in England hastened his return. He was \rbrought face to face with the question whether or not he should \rbear his part in the coming struggle ; whether without self- \rreproach he could lead any longer this life of learning and \rindifference to the public weal. He decided as we might have \rexpected that he would decide, though some good critics see \r\r\r\rLIFE OF MILTON. XV11 \r\rcause to regret the decision. Milton puts his position very \rclearly in his Defensio Secunda : " I thought it base to be \rtravelling for amusement abroad, while my fellow-citizens were \rfighting for liberty at home." And later : " I determined to \rrelinquish the other pursuits in which I was engaged, and to \rtransfer the whole force of my talents and my industry to this \rone important object" (i.e. the vindication of liberty). \r\rThe summer of 1639 (July) found Milton back in England. \rImmediately after his return he wrote the Epitaphium Damonis, \rthe beautiful elegy in which he lamented the death of his school \rfriend, Diodati. Lytidas was the last of the English lyrics : the \rEpitaphium, which should be studied in close connection with \rLycidas, the last of the long Latin poems. Thenceforth, for a \rlong spell, the rest was silence, so far as concerned poetry. The \rperiod which for all men represents the strength and maturity \rof manhood, which in the cases of other poets produces the best \rand most characteristic work, is with Milton a blank. In twenty \ryears he composed no more than a bare handful of Sonnets, \rand even some of these are infected by the taint of political \ranimus. Other interests claimed him the question of Church- \rreform, education, marriage, and, above all, politics. \r\rMilton\'s first treatise upon the government of the Church \r(Of Reformation in England} appeared in 1641. Others \rfollowed in quick succession. The abolition of Episcopacy \rwas the watchword of the enemies of the Anglican Church \rthe delenda est Carthago cry of Puritanism, and no one \renforced the point with greater eloquence than Milton. During \r1641 and 1642 he wrote five pamphlets on the subject. Mean- \rwhile he was studying the principles of education. On his \rreturn from Italy he had undertaken the training of his \rnephews. This led to consideration of the best educational \rmethods ; and in the Tractate of Education, 1644, Milton \rassumed the part of educational theorist. In the previous year, \rMay, 1643, ne married 1 . The marriage proved unfortunate. \r\r1 His wife (who was only seventeen) was Mary Powell, eldest \rdaughter of Richard Powell, of Forest Hill, a village some little \rdistance from Oxford. She went to stay with her father in July, \r\r\r\rxviii INTRODUCTION. \r\rIts immediate outcome was the pamphlets on divorce. Clearly \rhe had little leisure for literature proper. \r\rThe finest of Milton\'s prose works, the Areopagitica, a plea \rfor the free expression of opinion, was published in 1644. In \r1645 l appeared the first collection of his poems. In 1649 his \radvocacy of the anti-royalist cause was recognised by the offer \rof a post under the newly appointed Council of State. His bold \rvindication of the trial of Charles I., The Tenure of Kings, had \rappeared earlier in the same year. Milton accepted the offer, \rbecoming Latin 2 Secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs. \r\r1643, and refused to return to Milton ; why, it is not certain. She \rwas reconciled to her husband in 1645, bore him four children, and \rdied in 1652, in her twenty-seventh year. No doubt, the scene in P. L. \rX. 909 36, in which Eve begs forgiveness of Adam, reproduced the \rpoet\'s personal experience, while many passages in Samson Agonistes \rmust have been inspired by the same cause. \r\r1 i.e. old style. The volume was entered on the registers of the \rStationers\' Company under the date of October 6th, 1645. It was \rpublished on Jan. i, 1645 46, with the following title-page : \r\r"Poems of Mr. John Milton, both English and Latin^ Composed at \rseveral times. Printed by his true Copies. The Songs were set in Mustek \rby Mr. Henry Lawes Gentleman of the Kings Chappel, and one of His \rMajesties Private Musick. \r\r* Baccare front em \r\rCingite, ne vati noceat mala lingua futuro.* VlRGIL, Eclog. 7. \rPrinted and published according to Order. London, Printed by Rttth \rRaworth for Humphrey Moseley, and are to be sold at the signe of the \rPrinces Arms in Pauls Churchyard. 1645." \r\rFrom the prefatory Address to the Reader it is clear that the collec- \rtion was due to the initiative of the publisher. Milton\'s own feeling is \rexpressed by the motto, where the words " vatifuturo " show that, as \rhe judged, his great achievement was yet to come. The volume was \rdivided into two parts, the first containing the English, the second the \rLatin poems. Comus was printed at the close of the former, with a \rseparate title-page to mark its importance. The prominence given to \rthe name of Henry Lawes reflects Milton\'s friendship. \r\r8 A Latin Secretary was required because the Council scorned, as \rEdward Phillips says, "to carry on their affairs in the wheedling, \rlisping jargon of the cringing French." Milton\'s salary was 288, in \rmodern money about 900. \r\r\r\rLIFE OF MILTON. \r\r\r\rXIX \r\r\r\rThere was nothing distasteful about his duties. He drew up \rthe despatches to foreign governments, translated state-papers, \rand served as interpreter to foreign envoys. Had his duties \rstopped here his acceptance of the post would, I think, have \rproved an unqualified gain. It brought him into contact with the \rfirst men in the state, gave him a practical insight into the \rworking of national affairs and the motives of human action ; in \ra word, furnished him with that experience of life which is \ressential to all poets who aspire to be something more than \r"the idle singers of an empty day." But unfortunately the \rsecretaryship entailed the necessity of defending at every turn \rthe past course of the revolution and the present policy of the \rCouncil. Milton, in fact, held a perpetual brief as advocate for \rhis party. Hence the endless and unedifying controversies into \rwhich he drifted ; controversies which wasted the most precious \ryears of his life, warped, as some critics think, his nature, and \reventually cost him his eyesight. \r\rBetween 1649 anc ^ 1660 Milton produced no less than eleven \rpamphlets. Several of these arose out of the publication of the \rfamous Eikon Basilike, The book was printed in 1649 and \rcreated so extraordinary a sensation that Milton was asked to \rreply to it ; and did so with Eikonoklastes. Controversy of this \rbarren type has the inherent disadvantage that once started it may \rnever end. The Royalists commissioned the Leyden professor, \rSalmasius, to prepare a counterblast, the Defensio Regia, and \rthis in turn was met by Milton\'s Pro Popiilo Anglicano Defensio^ \r1651, over the preparation of which he lost what little power of \reyesight remained 1 . Salmasius retorted, and died before his \r\r1 Perhaps this was the saddest part of the episode. Milton tells us \rin the Defensio Secunda that his eyesight was injured by excessive study \rin boyhood : " from twelve years of age I hardly ever left my studies or \rwent to bed before midnight." Continual reading and writing increased \rthe infirmity, and by 1650 the sight of the left eye had gone. He was \rwarned that he must not use the other for book-work. Unfortunately \rthis was just the time when the Commonwealth stood most in need of \rhis services. If Milton had not written the first Defence he might have \rretained his partial vision, at least for a time. The choice lay between \r\r\r\rXX INTRODUCTION. \r\rsecond farrago of scurrilities was issued : Milton was bound to \ranswer, and the Defensio Secunda appeared in 1654. Neither \rof the combatants gained anything by the dispute ; while the \rsubsequent development of the controversy in which Milton \rcrushed the Amsterdam pastor and professor, Morus, goes far to \rprove the contention of Mr Mark Pattison, that it was an evil \rday when the poet left his study at Horton to do battle for the \rCommonwealth amid the vulgar brawls of the market-place . \r\r"Not here, O Apollo, \rWere haunts meet for thee." \r\rFortunately this poetic interregnum in Milton\'s life was not \rdestined to last much longer. The Restoration came, a blessing \rin disguise, and in 1660 J the ruin of Milton\'s political party \rand of his personal hopes, the absolute overthrow of the cause \rfor which he had fought for twenty years, left him free. The \rauthor of Lycidas could once more become a poet. \r\rMuch has been written upon this second period, 1639 60. \rWe saw what parting of the ways confronted Milton on his \rreturn from Italy. Did he choose aright ? Should he have \rcontinued upon the path of learned leisure ? There are writers \rwho argue that Milton made a mistake. A poet, they say, \rshould keep clear of political strife : fierce controversy can \rbenefit no man : who touches pitch must expect to be, certainly \rwill be, defiled : Milton sacrificed twenty of the best years of \rhis life, doing work which an underling could have done and \rwhich was not worth doing : another Comus might have been \rwritten, a loftier Lycidas : that literature should be the poorer \rby the absence of these possible masterpieces, that the second \r\rprivate good and public duty. He repeated in 1650 the sacrifice of 1639. \rAll this is brought out in his Second Defence. By the spring of 1652 \rMilton was quite blind He was then in his forty-fourth year. Probably \rthe disease from which he suffered was amaurosis. See the Appendix \r(pp. 682, 683) on P. L. HI. 22 26. Throughout P. L. and Samson \rAgonistes there are frequent references to his affliction. \r\r1 Milton probably began Paradise Lost in 1658; but it was not till \rthe Restoration in 1660 that he definitely resigned all his political \rhopes, and became quite free to realise his poetical ambition. \r\r\r\rLIFE OF MILTON. xxi \r\rgreatest genius which England has produced should in a way \rbe the " inheritor of unfulfilled renown," is and must be a thing \rentirely and terribly deplorable. This is the view of the purely \rliterary critic. \r\rThere remains the other side of the question. It may fairly \rbe contended that had Milton elected in 1639 to live the scholar\'s \rlife apart from " the action of men," Paradise Lost, as we have \rit, or Samson Agonistes could never have been written. Know- \rledge of life and human nature, insight into the problems oi \rmen\'s motives and emotions, grasp of the broader issues of the \rhuman tragedy, all these were essential to the author of an epic \rpoem ; they could only be obtained through commerce with the \rworld ; they would have remained beyond the reach of a recluse. \rDryden complained that Milton saw nature through the spec- \rtacles of books : we might have had to complain that he saw \rmen through the same medium. Fortunately it is not so : and \rit is not so because at the age of thirty-two he threw in his \rfortunes with those of his country ; like the diver in Schiller\'s \rballad he took the plunge which was to cost him so dear. The \rmere man of letters will never move the world. ^Cschylus fought \rat Marathon : Shakespeare was practical to the tips of his \rfingers ; a better business man than Goethe there was not \rwithin a radius of a hundred miles of Weimar. \r\rThis aspect of the question is emphasised by Milton himself. \rThe man, he says, " who would not be frustrate of his hope to \rwrite well hereafter in laudable things, ought himself to be a \rtrue poem , that is, a composition and pattern of the best and \rhonourablest things; not presuming to sing high praises of heroic \rmen, or famous cities, unless he have in himself the experience \rand the practice of all that which is praiseworthy 1 ." Again, in \restimating the qualifications which the writer of an epic such as \rhe contemplated should possess, he is careful to include \r"insight into all seemly and generous arts and affairs 2 ." \r\rTruth usually lies half-way between extremes : perhaps it \rdoes so here. No doubt, Milton did gain very greatly by \r\r1 An Apology for Smectymnuus, P. W. in. 118. \ra The Reason of Church Government, P. W. II. 481. \r\r\r\rxxii INTRODUCTION. \r\rbreathing awhile the larger air of public life, even though \rthat air was often tainted by much impurity. No doubt, too, \rtwenty years of contention must have left their mark even on \rMilton. In one of the very few places where he " abides our \rquestion," Shakespeare writes (Sonnet CXI.) : \r\r"OI for my sake do you with Fortune chide, \rThe guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, \rThat did not better for my life provide, \rThan public means, which public manners breeds : \rThence comes it that my name receives a brand ; \rAnd almost thence my nature is subdued \rTo what it works in, like the dyer\'s hand." \r\rMilton\'s genius was subdued in this way. If we compare \rhim, the Milton of the great epics and of Samson Agonistes, \rwith Homer or Shakespeare and none but the greatest can \rbe his parallel we find in him a certain want of humanity, \ra touch of narrowness. He lacks the large-heartedness, the \rgenial, generous breadth of Shakespeare ; the sympathy and \rsense of the lacrimce rerum that even in Troilus and Cressida or \rTimon of Athens are there for those who have eyes wherewith \rto see them. Milton reflects in some degree the less gracious \raspects of Puritanism, its intolerance, want of humour, one-sided \rintensity ; and it seems natural to assume that this narrowness \rwas to a great extent the price he paid for twenty years of cease- \rless special pleading and dispute. The real misfortune of his \rlife lay in the fact that he fell on evil, angry days when there \rwas no place for moderate men. He had to be one of two \rthings : either a controversialist or a student : there was no via \rmedia. Probably he chose aright ; but we could wish that the \rconditions under which he chose had been different. And he \ris so great, so majestic in the nobleness of his life, in the purity \rof his motives, in the self-sacrifice of his indomitable devotion \rto his ideals, that we could wish not even to seem to pronounce \rjudgment at all. \r\rThe last part of Milton\'s life, 1660 74, passed quietly. At \rthe age of fifty-two he was thrown back upon poetry, and could \rat length discharge his self-imposed obligation. The early \r\r\r\rLIFE OF MILTON. xxiii \r\rpoems he had never regarded as a fulfilment of the debt due to \rhis Creator. Even when the fire of political strife burned at its \rhottest, Milton did not forget the purpose which he had conceived \rin his boyhood. Of that purpose Paradise Lost was the attain- \rment. Begun about 1658, it was finished in 1663, the year of \rMilton\'s third 1 marriage; revised from 1663 to 1665; and \reventually issued in 1667. Before its publication Milton had \rcommenced (in the autumn of 1665) its sequel Paradise Re- \rgained, which in turn was closely followed by Samson Agonistes. \rThe completion of Paradise Regained may be assigned to the \ryear 1666 that of Samson Agonistes to 1667. Some time was \rspent in their revision ; and in January, 1671, they were pub- \rlished together, in a single volume. \r\rIn 1673 Milton brought out a reprint of the 1645 edition of \rhis Poems, adding most of the sonnets 2 written in the interval 3 \r\r1 Milton\'s second marriage took place in the autumn of 1656, i.e. \rafter he had become blind. His wife died in February, 1658. Cf. the \rSonnet, " Methought I saw my late espoused saint," the pathos of which \ris heightened by the fact that he had never seen her. \r\r2 The number of Milton\'s sonnets is twenty-three (if we exclude the \rpiece "On the New Forcers of Conscience"), five of which were \rwritten in Italian, probably during the time of his travels in Italy, \r1638, 1639. Ten sonnets were printed in the edition of 1645, tne l as t f \rthem being that entitled (from the Cambridge MS.) "To the Lady \rMargaret Ley." The remaining thirteen were composed between 1645 \rand 1658. The concluding sonnet, therefore (to the memory of Milton\'s \rsecond wife), immediately preceded his commencement of Paradise Lost. \rFour of these poems (xv. xvi. xvu. xxn.) could not, on account of \rtheir political tone, be included in the edition of 1673. They were \rpublished by Edward Phillips together with his memoir of Milton, 1694 \r(Sonnet xvu. having previously appeared in a Life of Vane). The \rsonnet on the " Massacre in Piedmont " is usually considered the finest \rof the collection, of which Mr Mark Pattison edited a well-known \redition, 1883. The sonnet inscribed with a diamond on a window pane \rin the cottage at Chalfont where the poet stayed in 1665 is (in the \rjudgment of a good critic) Miltonic, in not Milton\'s (Garnett, Life of \rMilton, p. 175). \r\r3 The 1673 edition also gave the juvenile piece On the Death of a \rFair Infant and At a Vacation Exercise, which for some reason had \rbeen omitted from the 1645 edition. \r\r\r\rxxiv INTRODUCTION. \r\rThe last four years of his life were devoted to prose works of no \rparticular interest 1 . He continued to live in London. His third \rmarriage had proved happy, and he enjoyed something of the \rrenown which was rightly his. Various well-known men used \rto visit him notably Dryden 2 , who on one of his visits asked \rand received permission to dramatise 3 Paradise Lost It does \rnot often happen that a university can point to two such poets \ramong her living sons, each without rival in his generation. \r\rMilton died in 1674, November 8th. He was buried in St \rGiles\' Church, Cripplegate. When we think of him we have to \rthink of a man who lived a life of very singular purity and \rdevotion to duty ; who for what he conceived to be his country\'s \rgood sacrificed and no one can well estimate the sacrifice \rduring twenty years the aim that was nearest to his heart and \rbest suited to his genius ; who, however, eventually realised his \rdesire of writing a great work in gloriam Dei. \r\r1 The treatise on Christian Doctrine (unpublished during Milton\'s \rlifetime and dating, it is thought, mainly from the period of his theo- \rlogical treatises) is valuable as throwing much light on the theological \rviews expressed in the two epic poems and Samson Agonistes. See \rMilton Memorial Lectures (1908), pp. 10942. The discovery of the \rMS. of this treatise in 1823 gave Macaulay an opportunity of writing \rhis famous essay on Milton, which has been happily described as a \rWhig counterblast to Johnson\'s Tory depreciation of the poet. \r\rMilton\'s History of Britain, though not published till 1670, had \rbeen written many years earlier ; four of the six books, we know, were \rcomposed between 1646 and 1649. \r\r2 The lines by Dryden which were printed beneath the portrait of \rMilton in Tonson\'s folio edition of Paradise Lost published in 1688 are \rtoo familiar to need quotation ; but it is worth noting that the younger \rpoet had in Milton\'s lifetime described the great epic as " one of the \rmost noble, and most sublime poems which either this age or nation \rhas produced" (prefatory essay to The State of Innocence, 1674). \rFurther, tradition assigned to Dryden (a Roman Catholic and a Royal- \rist) the remark, "this fellow (Milton) cuts us all out and the ancients \rtoo." \r\r3 See Marvell\'s "Commendatory Verses," 17 30, and the Notes, \r\rPP- 7*> 73- \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. XXV \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. \r\rWe have seen that the dominating idea of Milton\'s life was \rhis resolve to write a great poem great in theme, in style, in \rattainment. To this purpose was he dedicated as a boy: as \rHannibal was dedicated, at the altar of patriotism, to the cause \rof his country\'s revenge, or Pitt to a life of political ambition. \rMilton\'s works particularly his letters and prose pamphlets \renable us to trace the growth of the idea which was shaping his \rintellectual destinies ; and as every poet is best interpreted by \rhis own words, Milton shall speak for himself. \r\rTwo of the earliest indications of his cherished plan are \rthe Vacation Exercise and the second Sonnet. The Exercise \rcommences with an invocation (not without significance, as we \rshall see) to his "native language," to assist him in giving \rutterance to the teeming thoughts that knock at the portal of \rhis lips, fain to find an issue thence. The bent of these thoughts \ris towards the loftiest themes. Might he choose for himself, he \rwould select some "grave subject": \r\r" Such where the deep transported mind may soar \rAbove the wheeling poles, and at Heaven\'s door \rLook in, and see each blissful deity. \r\r\r\rThen sing of secret things that came to pass \rWhen beldam Nature in her cradle was." \r\rBut recognising soon that such matters are inappropriate to \rthe occasion a College festivity he arrests the flight of his \rmuse with a grave descende ccelo, and declines on a lower range \rof subject, more fitting to the social scene and the audience. \rThis Exercise was composed in 1628, in Milton\'s twentieth year, \ror, according to his method of dating, anno cEtatis xix. It is \rimportant as revealing firstly, the poet\'s consciousness of the \rdivine impulse within, for which poetry is the natural outlet ; \rsecondly, the elevation of theme with which that poetry must \rdeal. A boy in years, he would like to handle the highest \r\'arguments,\' challenging thereby comparison with the sacri \r\rP. L. (, \r\r\r\rxxvi INTRODUCTION. \r\rvates of inspired verse, the elect few whose poetic appeal is to \rthe whole world. A vision of Heaven itself must be unrolled \rbefore his steadfast eagle-gaze : he will win a knowledge of the \rcauses of things such as even Vergil, his master, modestly \rdisclaimed. Little wonder, therefore, that, filled with these \rambitions, Milton did not shrink, only two years later (1629 30), \rfrom attempting to sound the deepest mysteries of Christianity \rthe Nativity and the Passion of Christ ; howbeit, sensible of his \rimmaturity, he left his poem on the latter subject unfinished 1 . \r\rThe Sonnet to which reference has been made deserves \rquotation at length : \r\r" How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, \r\rStolen on his wing my three-and-twentieth year ! \r\rMy hasting days fly on with full career, \r\rBut my late spring no bud or blossom shew\'th. \rPerhaps my semblance might deceive the truth, \r\rThat I to manhood am arrived so near ; \r\rAnd inward ripeness doth much less appear, \r\rThat some more timely-happy spirits endu\'th. \rYet be it less or more, or soon or slow, \r\rIt shall be still in strictest measure even \r\rTo that same lot, however mean or high, \rToward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven ; \r\rAll is, if I have grace to use it so, \r\rAs ever in my great Task- Master\'s eye." \r\rMr Mark Pattison justly calls these lines "an inseparable \rpart of Milton\'s biography" : they bring out so clearly the poet\'s \rsolemn devotion to his self-selected task, and his determination \rnot to essay the execution of that task until the time of complete \r"inward ripeness" has arrived. The Sonnet was one of the last \rpoems composed by Milton during his residence at Cambridg-e. \r\r1 A passage in the sixth Elegy shows that the Nativity Ode (a \rprelude in some respects to Paradise Lost] was begun on Christmas \rmorning, 1629. The Passion may have been composed for the following \rEaster; it breaks off with the notice "This Subject the Author \rfinding to be above the years he had when he wrote it, and nothing \rsatisfied with what was begun, left it unfinished." Evidently Milton \rwas minded to recur to both subjects ; see later. \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. XXV11 \r\rThe date is 1631. From 1632 to 1638 was a period of almost \runbroken self-preparation, such as the Sonnet foreshadows. Of \rthe intensity of his application to literature a letter written in \r1637 (the exact day being Sept. 7, 1637) enables us to judge. \r\r" It is my way," he says to Carlo Diodati, in excuse for \rremissness as a correspondent, " to suffer no impediment, no \rlove of ease, no avocation whatever, to chill the ardour, to break \rthe continuity, or divert the completion of my literary pursuits. \rFrom this and no other reasons it often happens that I do not \rreadily employ my pen in any gratuitous exertions 1 ." But these \rexertions were not sufficient : the probation must last longer. In \rthe same month, on the 23rd, he writes to the same friend, who \rhad made enquiry as to his occupations and plans : " I am sure \rthat you wish me to gratify your curiosity, and to let you know \rwhat I have been doing, or am meditating to do. Hear me, my \rDiodati, and suffer me for a moment to speak without blushing \rin a more lofty strain. Do you ask what I am meditating ? By \rthe help of Heaven, an immortality of fame. But what am \rI doing? TTTpo(f)v5)j I am letting my wings grow and preparing \rto fly; but my Pegasus has not yet feathers enough to soar \raloft in the fields of air 2 ." Four years later we find a similar \radmission " I have neither yet completed to my mind the full \rcircle of my private studies... 3 ." \r\rThis last sentence was written in 1640 (or 1641). Meanwhile \rhis resolution had been confirmed by the friendly and flattering \rencouragement of Italian savants a stimulus which he records \rin an oft-cited passage 4 : \r\r"In the private academies 5 of Italy, whither I was favoured \r\r1 P. W. in. 492. 2 P m IIL 5> \r\r3 P. W. n. 47 6. \r\r4 The Reason of Church Government, P. W. 11. 477, 478 ; a few \rlines have been quoted in the Life of Milton. A passage similar to the \rconcluding sentence might be quoted from the pamphlet Animadversions, \rpublished the same year (1641) as the Church Government-, see P. IV. \rin. 72. \r\r5 He refers to literary societies or clubs, of which there were several \rat Florence, e.g. the Delia Crusca, the Svogliati, etc. \r\rC 2 \r\r\r\rxxvin INTRODUCTION. \r\rto resort, perceiving that some trifles 1 which I had in memory, \rcomposed at under twenty or thereabout, (for the manner is, \rthat every one must give some proof of his wit and reading \rthere,) met with acceptance above what was looked for ; and \rother things 2 , which I had shifted in scarcity of books and \rconveniences to patch up amongst them, were received with \rwritten encomiums, which the Italian is not forward to bestow \ron men of this side the Alps ; I began thus far to assent both \rto them and divers of my friends here at home, and not less to \ran inward prompting which now grew daily upon me, that by \rlabour and intense study (which I take to be my portion in this \rlife), joined with the strong propensity of nature, I might perhaps \rleave something so written to aftertimes, as they should not \rwillingly let it die." \r\rIt was during this Italian journey (1638 39) that Milton \rfirst gave a hint of the particular direction in which this ambition \rwas setting : at least we are vouchsafed a glimpse of the possible \rsubject-matter of the contemplated poem, and there is that on \rwhich may be built conjecture as to its style. He had enjoyed \rat Naples the hospitality of the then famous writer Giovanni \rBattista Manso, whose courteous reception the young English \rtraveller, ut ne ingratutn se ostenderet^ acknowledged in the piece \rof Latin hexameters afterwards printed in his Sylv(z under the \rtitle Mansus. In the course of the poem Milton definitely speaks \rof the remote legends of British history more especially, the \rArthurian legend as the theme which he might some day treat. \r" May I," he says, "find such a friend 3 as Manso," \r\r1 i.e. Latin pieces; the Elegies, as well as some of the poems \rincluded in his Sylva, were written before he was twenty-one. \r\r2 Among the Latin poems which date from his Italian journey are \rthe lines Ad Sahillum, a few of the Epigrams, and Mansus. Perhaps, \rtoo, the "other things" comprehended those essays in Italian verse \rwhich he had the courage to read before a Florentine audience, and \rthey the indulgence to praise. \r\r3 i.e. a friend who would pay honour to him as Manso had paid \rhonour to the poet Marini. Manso had helped in the erection of a \rmonument to Marini at Naples ; and Milton alludes to this at the \rbeginning of the poem. From Manso he would hear about Tasso. \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. XXIX \r\r" Siquando 1 indigenas revoeabo in car/nina reges, \rArtururnque etiani sub terris bella moventem, \rAut dicam invictce sociali feeders mensce \rMngnaniiiios heroas, et (O modo spiritus adsif) \rFrangam Saxonicas Britonum sub Marie phalanges ! " \r\rThis was in 1638. In the next year, after his return to \rEngland, he recurs to the project in the Epitapkium Damonis \r(162 71), his account being far more detailed : \r\r"Ipse"* 1 ego Dardanias Riitupina per aquora puppes \rDicam, et Pandrasidos regnum vetus Inogenitz, \rBrennumque Arviragumque duccs, priscumqu? Belinum, \rEt tandem Armoricos Britonum sub lege colonos ; \rTurn gravidam Arturo fatali fraude logernen; \rMendaces vultus, assumptaque Gorlois anna, \rMerlini dolus. O, mihi turn si vita supersit, \rTu procul annosa pendebis, fistula, pinu, \rMultum oblita mihi, aut patriis mutata Camccnis \rBrittonicum strides ! " \r\rHere, as before, he first glances at the stories which date \rfrom the very dawn of British myth and romance, and then \r\r1 "If ever I shall revive in verse our native kings, and Arthur \rlevying war in the world below ; or tell of the heroic company of \rthe resistless Table Round, and be the inspiration mine ! break the \rSaxon bands neath the might of British chivalry" (Mansus, 80 84). \rHis Common-place Book has a quaint reference to " Arturs round \rtable." \r\r2 "I will tell of the Trojan fleet sailing our southern seas, and the \rancient realm of Imogen, Pandrasus\' daughter, and of Brennus, Arvi- \rragus, and Belinus old, and the Armoric settlers subject to British laws. \rThen will I sing of logerne, fatally pregnant with Arthur how Uther \rfeigned the features and assumed the armour of Gorlois, through \rMerlin\'s craft. And you, my pastoral pipe, an life be lent me, shall \rhang on some sere pine, forgotten of me; or changed to native notes \rshall shrill forth British strains." In the first lines he alludes to the \rlegend of Brutus and the Trojans landing in England. Riitupina=. \rKentish. The story of Arthur\'s birth at which he glances is referred to \rin the Idylls of the King. The general drift of the last verses is that he \rwill give up Latin for English verse ; strides is a future, from strido (cf. \r<neid iv. 689). \r\r\r\rINTRODUCTION. \r\rpasses to the most fascinating of the later cycles of national \rlegend the grey traditions that cluster round the hero of the \rIdylls of the King, the son of mythic Uther. And this passage, \ralbeit the subject which it indicates was afterwards rejected by \rMilton, possesses a twofold value for those who would follow, \rstep by step, the development of the idea which had as its \rfinal issue the composition of Paradise Lost. For, first, the \rconcluding verses show that whatever the theme of the poem, \rwhatever the style, the instrument of expression would be \rEnglish. Just as Dante had weighed the merits of the \rvernacular and Latin and chosen the former, though the choice \rimposed on him the creation of an ideal, transfigured Italian \rout of the baser elements of many competing dialects,. so Milton \rmore fortunate than Dante in that he found an instrument \rready to use will use that "native language" whose help he had \rpetitioned in the Vacation Exercise. An illustration of his \rfeeling on this point is furnished by the treatise on Church \rGovernment, He says there that his work must make for " the \rhonour and instruction" of his country: "I applied myself to \rthat resolution which Ariosto followed... to fix all the industry \rand art I could unite to the adorning of my native tongue ; not \rto make verbal curiosities the end (that were a toilsome vanity), \rbut to be an interpreter and relater of the best and sagest things \ramong mine own citizens throughout this island in the mother \rdialect. That what the greatest and choicest wits of Athens, \rRome, or modern Italy, and those Hebrews of old did for their \rcountry, I, in my proportion, with this over and above, of being \ra Christian, might do for mine 1 ; not caring to be once named \r\r1 P. W. n. 478. Reference has been made so frequently to this \rpamphlet on The Reason of Church Government urged against Prclaty, \r(1641), that it may be well to explain that the introduction to the \rsecond book is entirely autobiographical. Milton shows why he em- \rbarked on such controversies, how much it cost him to do so, what \rhopes he had of returning to poetry, what was his view of the poet\'s \rmission and of his own capacity to discharge that mission. His prose \rworks contain nothing more valuable than these ten pages of self- \rcriticism. \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. xxxi \r\rabroad, though perhaps I could attain to that, but content with \rthese British islands as my world." Here is a clear announce- \rment of his ambition to take rank as a great national poet. The \rnote struck is patriotism. He will produce that which shall set \rEnglish on a level with the more favoured Italian, and give his \rcountrymen cause to be proud of their \r\r"dear dear land, \rDear for her reputation through the world 1 ." \r\rTo us indeed it may appear strange that Milton should \rhave thought it worth while to emphasise what would now \rbe considered a self-evident necessity : what modern poet, \rwith a serious conception of his office and duty, would dream \rof employing any other language than his own ? But we must \rremember that in those days the empire of the classics was \runquestioned : scholarship was accorded a higher dignity than \rnow : the composition of long poems in Latin was still a custom \rhonoured in the observance : and whoso sought to appeal to \rthe "laureate fraternity" of scholars and men of letters, in- \rdependently of race and country, would naturally turn to the \rlingua franca of the learned. At any rate, the use of English \rless known than either Italian or French placed a poet at a \rgreat disadvantage, so far as concerned acceptance in foreign \rlands ; and when Milton determined to rely on his patrice \rCamcence, he foresaw that this would circumscribe his audience, \rand that he might have to rest content with the applause of his \rown countrymen. \r\rAgain, these lines in the Epitaphium give us some grounds \rof surmise as to the proposed form of his poem. The historic \revents or traditions epitomised in the passage were too far \rseparated in point of time, and too devoid of internal coherence \rand connection, to admit of dramatic treatment. Milton evi- \rdently contemplated a narrative poem, and for one who had \rdrunk so deep of the classical spirit a narrative could scarce \rhave meant aught else than an epic. Indeed thus much is \rimplied by some sentences in The Reason of Church Govern- \r\r1 Richard 1L n. i. 57, 58. \r\r\r\rXXX11 INTRODUCTION. \r\rmentj which represent him as considering whether to attempt \r" that epic form whereof the two poems of Homer, and those \rother two of Virgil and Tasso, are a diffuse, and the book of Job \ra brief model... or whether those dramatic constitutions, wherein \rSophocles and Euripides reign, shall be found more doctrinal \rand exemplary to a nation 1 ." \r\rBut \'dramatic\' introduces a fresh phase; and as the first \rperiod of the history of Paradise Lost, or rather of the idea \rwhich finally took shape in that poem, closes with the Epita- \rphium (1639), it may not be amiss to summarise the impressions \rdeduced up to this point from the various passages which we \rhave quoted from Milton. We have seen, then, Milton\'s early \rresolve ; its ambitious scope ; his self-preparation ; the en- \rcouragement he received in Italy and from friends at home ; \rhis announcement in 1638, repeated in 1639, that he has \rdiscovered a suitable subject in British fable more especially, \rin the legend of the Coming and Passing of Arthur ; his formal \rfarewell to Latin verse, in favour of his native tongue; his desire \rto win recognition as a great national vates ; and his selection \rof the epic style. \r\rIn respect of chronology we have reached the year 1639 \r40. The second period extends from 1640 to 1642. We shall \rsee that, some verses of Paradise Lost were written about 1642 : \rafter 1642, up till 1658, we hear no more of the poem proof \rthat the idea has been temporarily abandoned under stress of \rpolitics. Therefore 1642 may be regarded as the ulterior limit \rof this second period. And it is not, I think, fanciful to consider \rthat Paradise Lost entered on a fresh stage about 1640, because \rbetween that year and 1642 Milton\'s plans underwent a twofold \rchange by which the character of the poem was entirely altered. \r\rFirst, the subject for which he had shown so decided a bias \ris discarded : after 1639 no mention is made of King Arthur. \rWe have no hint of the cause which led Milton to drop the \rsubject ; but it may well have lain in his increasing re- \rpublicanism. He could not have treated the theme from an \r\r1 P. W. ii. 47 8, 479. \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. xxxiii \r\runfavourable standpoint. The hero of the poem must have \rbeen for him, as for the Milton of our own age, a type of \rall kingly grandeur and worth ; and it would have gone sore \ragainst the grain with the future apologist for regicide to exercise \rhis powers in creating a royal figure that would shed lustre on \rmonarchy, and in a measure plead for the institution which \rMilton detested so heartily 1 . Only a Royalist could have retold \rthe story, making it illustrate " the divine right of kings," and \rembodying in the character of the blameless monarch the \rCavalier conception of Charles I. Perhaps too he was in- \rfluenced by discovering, after fuller research, the mythical \rcharacter of the legend. So much is rather implied by some \rremarks in his History of Britain. Milton with his intense \rearnestness was not the poet to build a long work on what he \rhad found to be mainly fiction. Be this as it may, Milton \rrejected the subject, and it finds no place in a list of one \rhundred possible subjects of his poem. \r\rSecondly, from this period, 1640 42, dates an alteration \rin the design of the contemplated work. Hitherto his tendency \rhas been towards the epic form: now (1640 or 1641) we find \rhim preferring the dramatic. Shall he imitate Sophocles and \rEuripides ? Shall he transplant to English soil the art of the \r" lofty grave tragedians " of Greece ? The question is answered \rin a decided affirmative. Had Milton continued the poem of \rwhich the opening lines were written in 1642 we should have \rhad not an epic but a drama, or possibly a trilogy of dramas, \rcast in a particular manner, as will be observed presently. \rThis transference of his inclinations from the epic to the \r"dramatic style appears to date from 1641. It is manifested in \rthe Milton MSS. at Trinity College. . \r\rWhen the present library of Trinity College, the erection of \rwhich was begun during the Mastership of Isaac Barrow, was \rcompleted, one of its earliest benefactors was a former member \rof Trinity, Sir Henry Newton Puckering. Among his gifts was \ra thin MS. volume of fifty-four pages, which had served Milton \ras a common-place book. How it came into the possession of \rSir Henry Puckering is not known. He was contemporary \r1 See the notes on P. L. xu. 24, 36. \r\r\r\rxxxiv INTRODUCTION. \r\rwith, though junior to, Milton, and may possibly have been one \rof the admirers who visited the poet in the closing years of his \rlife, and discharged the office of amanuensis ; or perhaps there \rwas some family connection by means of which the MS. passed \rinto his hands. But if the history of the book be obscure, its \rvalue is not ; for it contains now in Milton\'s autograph, now \rin other, unidentified handwritings the original drafts of several \rof his early poems : notably of Arcades, Lycidas and Camus, \rtogether with many of the Sonnets. The volume is not a \rrandom collection of scattered papers bound together after \rMilton\'s death : it exists (apart from its sumptuous modern \rinvestiture) exactly in the same form as that wherein Milton \rknew and used it two centuries and a half agone. And this \rpoint is important because the order of the pages, and, by \rconsequence, of their contents, is an index to the order of the \rcomposition of the poems. Milton, about the year 1631, had \rhad the sheets of paper stitched together and then worked \rthrough the little volume, page on page, inserting his pieces as \rthey were written. They cover a long period, from 16 to 1658: \rthe earlier date being marked by the second Sonnet, the later \rby the last of the series " Methought I saw." It is rather more- \rthan half way through the MS. that we light on the entries \rwhich have so direct a bearing on the history of Paradise Lost. \rThese are notes, written by Milton himself (probably in \r1641), and occupying seven pages of the manuscript, on subjects \rwhich seemed to him suitable, in varying degrees of appropriate- \rness, for his poem. Some of the entries are very brief concise \rjottings down, in two or three words, of any theme that struck \rhim. Others are more detailed : the salient features of some \repisode in history are selected, and a sketch of the best method \rof treating them added. In a few instances these sketches are \rfilled in with much minuteness and care: the \'economy\' or \rarrangement of the poem is marked out the action traced from \rpoint to point. But, Paradise Lost apart, this has been done in \ronly a few cases a half dozen, at most. As a rule, the source \rwhence the material of the work might be drawn is indicated. \rThe subjects themselves, numbering just one hundred, fall, in a \rrough classification, under two headings Scriptural and British : \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. XXXV \r\rand by * British \' are meant those which Milton drew from the \rchronicles of British history prior to the Norman Conquest. \rThe former are the more numerous class : sixty-two being \rderived from the Bible, of which the Old Testament claims \rfifty-four. Their character will be best illustrated by quotation \rof a few typical examples : \r\rAbram in ./Egypt. \rJosuah in Gibeon. Josu. 10. \rJonathan rescu\'d Sam. I. 14. \rSaul in Gilboa i Sam. -28. 31. \rGideon Idoloclastes Jud. 6. 7. \rAbimelech the usurper. Jud. 9. \rSamaria liberata 1 2 Reg. 7. \rAsa or ^Ethiopes. 2 chron. 14. with \rthe deposing his mother, and burning her Idol. \r\rThese are some of the subjects drawn from the New Testa- \rment : \r\rChrist bound \r\rChrist crucifi\'d \r\rChrist risen. \r\rLazarus Joan. n. \r\rChristus patiens \r\rThe Scene in y e garden beginning fr5 y e comming thither till \rJudas betraies & y e officers lead him away y e rest by message & \rchorus, his agony may receav noble expressions \r\rOf British subjects 2 there are thirty-three. The last page is \rassigned to " Scotch stories or rather brittish of the north parts. 1 \' \rAmong these Macbeth is conspicuous. Practically they may be \rgrouped with the thirty-three, and the combined list is remark- \rable first, because it does not include the Arthurian legend, \r\r1 The title is an obvious allusion to Tasso\'s Gerusalemme Liberata. \r\r2 Milton\'s attitude towards them is illustrated indirectly by his \rHistory of Britain. In his paper on " Milton as an Historian " read \rbefore the British Academy recently (Nov. 25, 1908) Professor Frith \rsays : " It was not only by his treatment of the mythical period of \rEnglish history that Milton\'s interest in the legendary and anecdotic \rside of history was revealed. It appeared in the later books as well \ras the earlier, and the introduction of certain episodes, or the space \rdevoted to them, might often be explained by their inclusion in the \rlist of suggested subjects for his \' British Tragedies.\' " \r\r\r\rXXXVI INTRODUCTION. \r\rwhich had once exercised so powerful a fascination on Milton ; \rsecondly, because in its brevity, as compared with the list of \rScriptural subjects, it suggests his preference for a sacred poem. \rOf the Scriptural subjects the story of the Creation and Fall \rassumes the most prominent place. Any friend of Milton \rglancing through these papers in 1641 could have conjectured, \rwith tolerable certainty, where the poet\'s final choice would fall. \rFor no less than four of the entries refer to Paradise Lost. \rThree of these stand at the head of the list of sacred themes. \rIn two at least his intention to treat the subject in dramatic \rform is patent. The two first mere enumerations of possible \rdramatis persona run thus 1 ; it will be seen that the longer list \ris simply an expansion of the other : \r\rthe Persons the Persons \r\rMichael. Moses 2 \r\rHeavenly Love Justice 8 .

"Wisdome" was added. \r\r4 After Conscience Milton added Death, as in the first list ; then \rdeleted it, and placed Death among the \' mutes \' (inutce persona, \rcharacters who appeared without speaking). \r\r\r\rmutes \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. xxxvii \r\rThese lists are crossed out ; and underneath stands a much \rfuller sketch, in which the action of the tragedy is shown, and \rthe division into acts observed. Here, too, we first meet with \rthe title Paradise Lost.

Peck has divided them ; and closes the first Act \rwith Adam and Eve\'s love." The other Acts may be supposed \rto conclude at the following points : Act 2 at " sung a hymn of \rthe creation"; Act 3 at "inform\'d... the manner of his fall"; \rAct 4 at "bids him beware... impenitence" ; Act 5 at "the chorus \rbreifly concludes." \r\rIt is in regard to the first Act that this fourth draft, which \r\r1 passing through ; cf. Comus, 423. \r\r2 i.e. in the third draft. \r\r3 Each of these sentences was an after-thought, added below or in \rthe margin. \r\r1 occupies. & i-e. reasons ; or \' to reason.\' \r\r6 See xi. 47793. note. \r\r\r\rxi INTRODUCTION. \r\rMilton bids us "compare with the former," marks a distinct \radvance. Milton made Moses the speaker of the prologue in \rthe third draft because so much of the subject-matter of \rParadise Lost is drawn from the Mosaic books of the Old \rTestament. But the appearance of a descendant of Adam, \reven in a prologue, where much latitude is allowed by con- \rvention, seems an awkward prelude to scenes coincident with \rAdam\'s own creation. It is far more natural that, before the \rsubject of man\'s fall is touched upon at all, we should be told \rwho man is, and that this first mention of him should come \rfrom the supernatural beings who had, or might have, witnessed \rthe actual creation of the universe and its inhabitants. The \rexplanation, too, why Moses is able to assume his natural body \ris very forced. And altogether this fourth draft exhibits more \rof drama, less of spectacle, than its predecessor. \r\rWith regard to the subject, therefore, thus much is clear : \ras early as 1641 2 Milton has manifested an unmistakeable \rpreference for the story of the lost Paradise, and the evidence \rof the Trinity MSS. coincides with the testimony of Aubrey and \rPhillips, who say that the poet did, about 1642, commence the \rcomposition of a drama on this theme of which drama the \ropening verses of Paradise Lost, book IV. (Satan\'s address to \rthe sun), formed the exordium. It is, I think, by no means \rimprobable that some other portions of the epic are really \rfragments of this unfinished work. Milton may have written \rtwo or three hundred lines, have kept them in his desk, and \rthen, years afterward, when the project was resumed, have made \ruse of them where opportunity offered. Had the poem, however, \rbeen completed in accordance with his original conception we \rshould have had a tragedy, not an epic. \r\rOf this there is abundant proof. The third and fourth \rsketches, as has been observed, are dramatic. On the first \rpage of these entries, besides those lists of dramatis persona \rwhich we have treated as the first and second sketches, stand \rthe words "other Tragedies," followed by the enumeration of \rseveral feasible subjects. The list of British subjects is \rprefaced with the heading "British Trag." (i.e. tragedies). \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. xli \r\rWherever Milton has outlined the treatment of any of the \rScriptural themes a tragedy is clearly indicated. Twice, indeed, \ranother form is mentioned the pastoral, and probably a \rdramatic pastoral was intended 1 . These, however, are ex- \rceptions, serving to emphasise his leaning towards tragedy. \r\rBut what sort of tragedy ? I think we may fairly conclude \rthat, if carried out on the lines laid down in the fourth sketch, \rAdam unparadiz\'d would have borne a very marked resem- \rblance to Samson Agonistes : it would have conformed, in the \rmain, to the same type that, namely, of the ancient Greek \rdrama. With the romantic stage of the Elizabethans Milton \rappears to have felt little sympathy 2 : else he would scarce have \rwritten // Penseroso, 101, 102. Nor do I believe that his \ryouthful enthusiasm for Shakespeare remained unmodified 3 : \rcertainly, the condemnation of one important aspect of Shake- \rspearian tragedy in the preface to Samson Agonistes is too plain \rto be misinterpreted. So had Milton been minded to dramatise \rthe story of Macbeth we have marked its presence in the list \rof Scottish subjects his Macbeth would have differed toto ccelo \rfrom Shakespeare\'s. In the same way, his tragedy of Paradise \rLost would have been wholly un-Shakespearian, wholly un- \rElizabethan. Nor would it have had any affinity to the drama \rof Milton\'s contemporaries 4 , those belated Elizabethans bungling \rwith exhausted materials and forms that had lost all vitality. \rTragedy for Milton could mean but one thing the tragic stage \rof the Greeks, the " dramatic constitutions " of Sophocles and \rEuripides : and when we examine these sketches of Paradise \r\r1 These are the two entries in the MS. : " Theristria. a Pastoral out \rof Ruth " ; and " the sheepshearers in Carmel a Pastoral, i Sam. 25." \rThere is but one glance at the epical style ; in the list of " British Trag." \rafter mentioning an episode in the life of King Alfred appropriate to \rdramatic handling, he adds "A Heroicall Poem may be founded \rsomwhere in Alfreds reigne. especially at his issuing out of Edelingsey \ron the Danes, whose actions are wel like those of Ulysses." \r\r2 See Appendix to Samson Agonistes. \r\r3 See note on V Allegro, 133, 134. \r\r4 In the treatise On Education, 1644, he speaks of "our common \rrhymers and play-writers" as "despicable creatures," P. W. III. 474. \r\rP. L. d \r\r\r\rxlii INTRODUCTION, \r\rLost we find in them the familiar features of Athenian drama \rcertain signs eloquent of the source on which the poet has \rdrawn. \r\rLet us, for example, glance at the draft of Adam unparadiz* d. \rMilton has kept the \'unities\' of place and time. The scene \rdoes not change ; it is set in some part of Eden, and everything \rrepresented before the eyes of the audience occurs at the same \rspot. But whoso regards the unity of place must suffer a \rportion of the action to happen off the stage not enacted in \rthe presence of the audience (as in a modern play where the \rscene changes), but reported. In Samson Agonistes Milton \remploys the traditional device of the Greek tragedians he \rrelates the catastrophe by the mouth of a messenger. So here : \rthe temptation by the serpent is not represented on the scene : \rit is described partly by Lucifer, "relating, and insulting in \rwhat he had don to the destruction of man"; partly by an angel \rwho informs the Chorus of the manner of the fall. Again, the \runity of time is observed. The time over which the action of a \rtragedy might extend, according to the usual practice of the \rGreek dramatists, was twenty-four hours. In Samson Agonistes \rthe action begins at sunrise and ends at noon, thus occupying \rseven or eight hours. In Adam unparaditfd the action would \rcertainly not exceed the customary twenty-four hours. Again a \rChorus is introduced (sure sign of classical influence), and not \ronly introduced, but handled exactly as Milton, following his \rGreek models, has handled it in Samson Agonistes : that is to \rsay, closely identified with the action of the tragedy, even as \rAristotle recommends that it should be. Further, in the fourth \rscheme the division into acts is carefully avoided an advance \rthis on the third scheme. Similarly, in Samson Agonistes \rMilton avoids splitting up the play into scenes and acts, calling \rattention to the fact in his preface. Proofs 1 of Milton\'s \r\r1 Thus, apart from P. L., the Scriptural themes whereof the fullest \rsketches are given, are three tragedies severally entitled " Abram from \rMorea, or Isack redeemed Baptistes" (i.e. on the subject of John the \rBaptist and Herod) and "Sodom Burning." In each two unities \r(time and place) are kept, and a Chorus used. In " Isack redeemed" the \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. xliii \r\rclassical bias might be multiplied from these Milton MSS. ; \rand personally I have no doubt that when he began the tragedy \rof which Aubrey and Phillips speak, he meant to revive in \rEnglish the methods and style of his favourite Greek poets. \rBut the scheme soon had to be abandoned ; and not till a \rquarter of a century later was it executed in Samson Agonistcs\\ \rWith Milton as with Dante the greatest came last after long \rdelay : the life\'s work of each marked the life\'s close : and, \rthe work done, release soon came to each, though to Dante \rsooner 2 . \r\rThe third period in the genesis of Paradise Lost dates from \r1658. In that year, according to Aubrey, Milton began the \rpoem as we know it. By then he had gone back to the epic \rstyle. He was still Secretary, but his duties were very light, \rand allowed him to devote himself to poetry. At the Restoration \rhe was in danger, for some time, of his life, and was imprisoned \rfor a few months. But in spite of this interruption, and of his \rblindness 3 , the epic was finished about 1663. The history of \r\rincident of the sacrifice is reported, and the description of the character \rof the hero Abraham as Milton meant to depict him is simply a \rparaphrase on Aristotle\'s definition of the ideal tragic hero. Most of \rthe other subjects have a title such as the Greek tragedians employed \re.g. " Elias Polemistes," "Elisseus Hydrochoos," "Zedechiah j/eore- \r\r\r\r1 The point is important because it disposes of the notion that \rMilton borrowed the idea of writing a tragedy on the classical model \rfrom the play of Samson by the Dutch poet Vondel. \r\r2 "There is at once similarity and difference in the causes which \rmade each postpone the execution of his undertaking till a comparatively \rlate period in his life ; and a curious parallel may be observed in the \rlength of time between the first conception and the completion of their \rmonumental works, as well as in the period that elapsed between the \rend of their labours and their death." (Courthope.) \r\r3 According to Edward Phillips, Milton dictated the poem to any \rone who chanced to be present and was willing to act as amanuensis; \rafterwards Phillips would go over the MS., correcting errors, under his \runcle\'s direction. The original transcript submitted to the Licenser is \rextant, and is one of the many literary treasures that have gone to \r\r\r\r\r\r\rxliv INTRODUCTION. \r\reach of his longer poems shows that he was exceedingly careful \rin revising his works loth to let them go forth to the world till \rall that was possible had been done to achieve perfection 1 . It is \rAubrey\'s statement that Paradise Lost was completed in 1663 ; \rwhile Milton\'s friend Thomas Ellwood, the Quaker, describes \rin a famous passage of his Autobiography, how in 1665 the poet \rplaced a manuscript in his hands " bidding me take it home \rwith me and read it at my leisure, and, when I had so done, \rreturn it to him with my judgment thereupon. When I came \rhome, and had set myself to read it, I found it was that ex- \rcellent poem which he intituled Paradise Lost" Ellwood\'s \raccount may be reconciled with Aubrey\'s on the reasonable \rsupposition that the interval between 1663 and 1665 was spent \rin revision. Still, some delay in publishing the poem ensued. \rOn the outbreak of the Plague in 1665 Milton had left London, \rretiring to Chalfont in Buckinghamshire, where Ellwood had \rrented a cottage for him. He returned in the next year, 1666 ; \rbut again there was delay this time through the great Fire \rof London which disorganised business. . Not till 1667 did \rParadise Lost appear in print. The agreement (now in the \rpossession of the British Museum) drawn up between Milton \rand his publisher by which he received an immediate payment \rof ^5, and retained certain rights over the future sale of the \rbook is dated April 27, 1667. The date on which Paradise \rLost was entered in the Stationers\' Register is August 20, 1667. \rNo doubt, copies were in circulation in the autumn of this year. \r\rAmerica. It "passed from the possession of the first printer of the \rpoem, Samuel Simmons, to Jacob Tonson [the publisher], and thence \rto his collateral descendants, remaining in the same family... until \r1904," when it was bought by an American collector. (From an \rarticle in The Athenaum on " Miltoniana in America.") \r\r1 "When we look at his earlier manuscripts, with all their erasures \rand corrections, we may well wonder what the Paradise Lost would have \rbeen if he had been able to give it the final touches of a faultless and \rfastidious hand. When we think of it composed in darkness, preserved \rin memory, dictated in fragments, it may well seem to us the most \rastonishing of all the products of high genius guided by unconquerable \rwill" (J. W. Mackail). \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. xlv \r\rThe system of licensing publications, against which Milton \rhad protested so vehemently in his Areopagitica, had been revived \rby the Press Act of 1662 and was now strongly enforced. " By \rthat act," says Dr Masson, " the duty of licensing books of general \rliterature had been assigned to the Secretaries of State, the \rArchbishop of Canterbury, and the Bishop of London ; but it \rwas exceptional for any of those dignitaries to perform the duty \rin person. It was chiefly performed for them by a staff of under- \rlicencers, paid by fees. 37 Five or six of his chaplains acted so for \rthe Archbishop ; and according to tradition one of them, to \rwhom Paradise Lost was submitted, hesitated to give his im- \rprimatur on account of the lines in the first book about eclipses \rperplexing monarchs with fear of change (i. 594 99). Milton \rmust have remembered grimly the bitter gibes in his pamphlets, \re.g. in the A nimadversions (1641) against "monkish prohibitions, \rand expurgatorious indexes," and "proud Imprimaturs not to be \robtained without the shallow surview, but not shallow hand of \rsome mercenary, narrow-souled, and illiterate chaplain." The \rwheel had come full circle with a vengeance. \r\rThis first edition of Paradise Lost raises curious points 1 of \rbibliography into which there is no need to enter here ; but we \rmust note three things. The poem was divided into not \rtwelve books but ten. In the earlier copies issued to the \rpublic there were no prose Arguments ; these (written, we may \rsuppose, by Milton himself) were printed all together and \rinserted at the commencement of each of the later volumes of \r\r\r\r1 For example, no less than nine distinct title-pages of this edition \rhave been traced. This means that, though the whole edition was \rprinted in 1667, only a limited number of copies were bound up and \rissued in that year. The rest would be kept in stock, unbound, and \rpublished in instalments, as required. Hence new matter could be \rinserted (such as the prose Arguments)^ and in each instalment it would \rbe just as easy to bind up a new title-page as to use the old one. Often \rthe date had to be changed : and we find that two of these pages bear \rthe year 1667; four, 1668 ; and three, 1669. Seven have Milton\'s \rname in full ; two, only his initials. Mr Leigh Sotheby collated them \rcarefully in his book on Milton\'s autograph, pp. 81 84. \r\r\r\rxlvi INTRODUCTION. \r\rthis first edition an awkward arrangement changed in the \rsecond edition. Milton prefixed to the later copies the brief \rprefatory note on The Verse, explaining why he had used blank \rverse ; and it was preceded by the address of The Printer to the \rReader. It seems that the number of copies printed in the first \redition was 1500; and the statement of another payment made \rby the publisher to Milton on account of the sale of the book \rshows that by April 26, 1669, i.e. a year and a half after the date \rof publication, 1300 copies had been disposed of. \r\rIn 1674 the second edition was issued with several changes. \rFirst, the epic (said to be 670 lines longer than the ^Eneid} \rwas divided into twelve books, a more Vergilian number, by the \rsubdivision of books VII. and X. Secondly, the prose Argu- \rments were transferred from the beginning and prefixed to their \rrespective books. Thirdly, a few changes were introduced into \rthe text few of any great significance. It was to the second \redition that the commendatory verses by Samuel Barrow and \rAndrew Marvell were prefixed. Four years later, 1678, came \rthe third edition, and in 1688 the fourth. This last was the \rwell-known folio published by Tonson ; Paradise Regained and \rSamson Agonistes were bound up with some copies of it, so that \rMilton\'s three great works were obtainable in a single volume. \rThe first annotated edition of Paradise Lost was that edited by \rPatrick Hume in 1695, being the sixth reprint. And during \rthe 1 8th century editions 1 were numerous. "Milton scholar- \rship 2 ,\'\' it has been justly said, "was active throughout the whole \rperiod." \r\rThere is, indeed, little (if any) ground for the view which one \rso frequently comes across that Paradise Lost met with scant \rappreciation, and that Milton was neglected by his contem- \r\r1 Pre-eminent among them is Bishop Newton\'s edition (1749). He \rwas the first editor who took pains to secure accuracy of text, doing, \ron a smaller scale, for Milton what Theobald did for Shakespeare. \rHis services too in the elucidation of certain aspects (notably the Scrip- \rtural) of Milton\'s learning have never been surpassed. \r\r2 See Professor Dowden\'s Tercentenary paper "Milton in the \rEighteenth Century (1701 1750)." \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. xlvii \r\rporaries, and without honour in his lifetime. To the general \rpublic epic poetry will never appeal, more especially if it be \rsteeped in the classical feeling that pervades Paradise Lost ; \rbut there must have been a goodly number of scholars and \rlettered readers to welcome the work else why these successive \reditions, appearing at no very lengthy intervals? One thing, \rdoubtless, which prejudiced its popularity was the personal \rresentment of the Royalist classes at Milton\'s political actions. \rThey could not forget his long identification with republicanism ; \rand there was much in the poem itself covert sneers and \rgibes which would repel many who were loyal to the Church \rand the Court. Further, the style of Paradise Lost was \rsomething very different from the prevailing tone of the \rliterature then current and popular. Milton was the last of the \rElizabethans, a lonely survival lingering on into days when \rFrench influence was beginning to dominate English taste. \rEven the metre of his poem must have sounded strange to ears \rfamiliarised to the crisp clearness and epigrammatic ring of the \rrhymed couplet 1 . Yet, in spite of these obstacles, many whose \rpraise was worth the having were proud of Milton : they felt \rthat he had done honour to his country. He was accorded that \rwhich he had sought so earnestly acceptance as a great \rnational poet ; and it is pleasant to read how men of letters \rand social distinction would pay visits of respect to him, and \rhow the white-winged Fame bore his name and reputation \rabroad, so that foreigners came to England for the especial \rpurpose of seeing him. And their visits were the prelude of \rthat foreign renown and influence from which he seemed to \rhave cut himself off when he made his native tongue the \rmedium of his great work. " Milton was the first English \rpoet to inspire respect and win fame for our literature on the \rContinent, and to his poetry was due, to an extent that has not \ryet been fully recognised, the change which came over European \rideas in the eighteenth century with regard to the nature and \rscope of the epic. Paradise Lost was the mainstay of those \r\r1 Cf. Marvell\'s "Commendatory Verses," 45 54. \r\r\r\rxlviii INTRODUCTION. \r\rcritics who dared to vindicate, in the face of French classicism, \rthe rights of the imagination over the reason in poetry 1 ." \r\rThere has been much discussion about the \'sources\' of \rParadise Lost, and writers well nigh as countless as Vallom- \rbrosa\'s autumn leaves have been thrust forth from their \robscurity to claim the honour of having \'inspired\' (as the \rphrase is) the great epic. Most of these unconscious claimants \rwere, like enough, unknown to Milton ; but some of them do \rseem to stand in a relation which demands recognition. \r\rI should place first the Latin tragedy Adamus Exul (1601), \rwritten in his youth by the great jurist Hugo Grotius after the \rmodel of Seneca. Apart from the question of actual resemblances \rto Paradise Lost, it might fairly be conjectured, if not assumed, \rthat Milton read this tragedy. He knew Grotius personally and \rknew his works. Describing, in the Second Defence, his Italian \rtour in 1638, Milton mentions his stay in Paris and friendly \rreception by the English ambassador, and adds : " His lordship \rgave me a card of introduction to the learned Hugo Grotius, at \rthat time ambassador from the Queen of Sweden to the French \rcourt; whose acquaintance I anxiously desired 2 ." He quotes the \ropinions of Grotius with high respect in his treatise on divorce 3 . \rThe alternative titles of the fourth draft of Milton\'s own con- \rtemplated tragedy, viz. Adam unparadisfd and Adams Banish- \rment, certainly recall the title Adamus Exul \\ and it may be \r\r\r\r1 Professor J. G. Robertson, \'\'Milton\'s Fame on the Continent," \ra paper read before the British Academy, Dec. 10, 1908. \r\rPerhaps the strangest and most delightful evidence of Milton\'s \racceptance among foreigners was Mr Maurice Baring\'s discovery of the \rpopularity of Paradise Lost, in a prose translation, amongst the Russian \rpeasantry and private soldiers : \r\r" The schoolmaster said that after all his experience the taste of the \rpeasants in literature baffled him. \' They will not read modern stories,\' \rhe said. \'When I ask them why they like Paradise Lost they point to \rtheir heart and say, "It is near to the heart ; it speaks; you read, and \ra sweetness comes to you." \' \r\r2 P. W. i. 255- \r\r3 See chapters XVII., XVHI. of The Doctrine and Discipline. \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. xlix \r\rnoted that this draft was sketched in that period (about 1641) \rof Milton\'s life to which his meeting with Grotius belongs. \rOf the likeness between Paradise Lost and the Adarmts Exut, \rand other works dealing with the same theme, it is impossible to \rsay how much, if not all, is due to identity of subject and (what \ris no less important) identity of convention as to the machinery \rproper for its treatment. But I do not think that community of \rsubject accounts entirely for the resemblances between Paradise \rLost and Grotius\'s tragedy. The conception of Satan\'s character \rand motives unfolded in his long introductory speech in the \rAdatmis, the general idea of his escaping from Hell and sur- \rveying Eden, his invocation of the powers of evil (amongst them \rChaos and Night) these things and some others, such as the \rAngel\'s narrative to Adam of the Creation, seem like far-off \rembryonic drawings of the splendours of the epic. It should be \radded that Grotius\'s other religious plays were known in England. \rA free rendering of his Christus Pattens into rhymed heroics \rwas published in London in 1640 under the title Christ\'s Passion; \rwhile his tragedy Sophompaneas^ or Joseph, appeared in an \rEnglish version in 1650. And a sidelight may be thrown not \rmerely on the contemporary estimate of Grotius by the ex- \rceptionally eulogistic mention of his works in the Theatrum \rPoetarum (1675) of Milton\'s nephew Edward Phillips. The \rTheatrum is commonly supposed to reflect in some degree \rMilton\'s own views 1 and it is significant therefore to find \rGrotius described as one "whose equal in fame for Wit & \rLearning, Christendom of late Ages hath rarely produc\'d, \rparticularly of so happy a Genius in Poetry, that had his Annals, \r\r1 See v. 177, 673, notes. Other touches in the Theatrum of \rMil tonic interest are the accounts of Spenser and Sylvester, and the \rpraise of Henry Lawes in the notice of Waller. One may conjecture, \rtoo, that the obscure Erycus Puteanus would not have had his niche \rbut for Comus. The Theatrum includes also Andreini but not Vondel. \rPhillips\'s account of Milton himself is admirably discreet : and he \rexpressly terms Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained " Heroic Poems." \rThe relations between uncle and nephew were more than ordinarily \rclose. \r\r\r\rINTRODUCTION. \r\rhis Book De Veritate Christiana Religionis...&K& other his \rextolled works in Prose, never come to Light, his extant and \runiversally approved Latin Poems, had been sufficient to gain \rhim a Living Name." \r\rIt is an easy transition from the Adamus Exulto the Adamo \rof the Italian poet Giovanni Battista Andreini (15781652), a \rFlorentine, which is said to owe something to Grotius\'s tragedy. \rVoltaire, in his Essai s ur la Podsie Epique written in 1727, related \rthat Milton during his residence at Florence saw "a comedy \r\rcalled Adamo^ The subject of the play was the Fall of Man: \r\rthe actors, the Devils, the Angels, Adam, Eve, the Serpent, \r\rDeath, and the Seven Mortal Sins Milton pierced through \r\rthe absurdity of that performance to the hidden majesty of the \rsubject ; which, being altogether unfit for the stage, yet might be, \rfor the genius of Milton, and his only, the foundation of an epick \rpoem." What authority he had for this legend Voltaire does not \rsay. It is not alluded to by any of Milton\'s contemporary bio- \rgraphers. It may have been a mere invention by some ill-wisher \rof the poet, a piece of malicious gossip circulated out of political \rspite against the great champion of republicanism. But the \rauthenticity of the story is not perhaps very important, for inde- \rpendently there seems to be evidence in the Adamo itself that \rMilton was acquainted with it even before his visit to Italy. One \rcannot read the scene of the Adamo (v. 5) in which the World, \rpersonified, tempts Eve with all its pomps and vanities, without \rbeing reminded of the scene in Comus of the temptation of the \rLady. And, as with the Adamus Exul, some of the coincidences \rof incident and treatment between the Adamo and Paradise \rLost, or Milton\'s early dramatic sketches of the action, seem to \rconstitute a residuum of resemblance after full allowance has \r\r1 It had been printed in 1613 (Milan), and again in 1617. The \rtitle-page of the first edition describes the work as " L\' Adamo, Sacra \rRapresentatione." It is more " a hybrid between a miracle play and an \ropera" (Courthope) than a "comedy." A translation by Cowper and \rHayley was printed in their edition of Milton ; and it is in this \rtranslation that the work is known to me. The fact that Cowper took \rthe Adamo theory seriously is significant. \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. li \r\rbeen made for the influence of practical identity of theme. \rThus the list of characters in the Adamo has abstractions like \rthe World, Famine, Labour, Despair, Death : and the ap- \rpearance of these and kindred evils of life to Adam and Eve \r(Act iv., scenes 6 and 7) recalls the early drafts of the scheme of \rParadise Lost and also the vision shown to Adam in the \releventh (477 99) book of the poem. Andreini makes Michael \rdrive Adam and Eve out of Paradise and depicts a final struggle \rbetween Michael and Lucifer. Andreini\'s representation of the \rSerpent\'s temptation of Eve has been thought to have left some \rimpression on the parallel scene in Paradise Lost. After the \rFall Lucifer summons the spirits of air and fire, earth and water \ra counterpart to Paradise Regained, II. 115 et seq. And occasion- \rally a verbal similarity arrests as where Lucifer says (iv. 2, end) \r\r" Let us remain in hell ! \rSince there is more content \rTo live in liberty, tho\' all condemn\'d, \rThan, as his vassals, blest 1 " \r\r(" Pot, ch? I maggior contento \rviver in liberta tutti dainnati^ \rche sudditi foafi"); \rand inveighs (iv. 2) : \r\r" Ahi luce, ahi luce odiata ! " \ror where the Angels describe Man (n. i) : \r\r"For contemplation of his Maker form\'d 71 \r("Per contemplar del suo gran Fabro il merto"}. \r\r1 See I. 263, note ; but of course the idea was not peculiar to any \rwriter. So tradition, literary or theological, may explain the following \rsimilarity, which is at least an interesting illustration of P. L. v. 688, \r699. Andreini makes Lucifer (i. 3) address his followers : \r"I am that Spirit, I, who for your sake \rCollecting dauntless courage, to the north \rLed you far distant from the senseless will \rOf him who boasts to have created heav\'n." \rThe reference occurs again in the Adamo, in. 8. \rTradition also may account for another feature common to the \rAdamo, the Adatmts and Paradise Lost, viz. the long description of the \rconvulsions and deterioration in the physical universe after the Fall of \rMan. \r\r\r\rHi INTRODUCTION. \r\rLeaving the matter for a moment we will pass to the third \rclaimant, the Dutch poet, Joost van den Vondel. He was \rcontemporary with Milton, and the author of a great number of \rworks. Among them were several dramas on Scriptural subjects. \rWith three of them Milton is supposed by some writers to have \rbeen acquainted. These are Lucifer (1654), a drama on the \rrevolt of the angels and their fall from heaven ; John the Messenger \r(1662), and Adam in Banishment (1664). In a work published \ra few years since it was contended that Milton borrowed a good \rdeal from these three poems. \r\rThat Milton had heard of Vondel may be conceded. \rVondel enjoyed a great reputation ; beside which, there was \rin the I7th century much intercourse between England and \rHolland, and Milton from his position as Secretary, no less \rthan from his controversies with Salmasius and Morus, must \rhave had his thoughts constantly directed towards the Nether- \rlands. Also, we learn that he had some knowledge of the Dutch \rlanguage. But it will be observed that the earliest of the poems \rwith which he is thought to have been too conversant, namely \rLucifer, was not published till after his blindness, while by the \rtime that the last of them, Adam in Banishment, appeared, \rParadise Lost was almost completed. It is impossible that \rMilton read a line of the works himself ; if he knew them at all, \rit must have been through the assistance of some reader or \rtranslator; and considering how many details concerning the \rlast years of Milton\'s life have survived, it is exceeding curious \rthat this reader or translator should have escaped mention, and \rthat the Vondelian theory should not have been heard of till a \rcentury after the poet\'s death. For there were plenty of people \rready to do him an ill-turn and damage his repute ; and \rplagiarism from his Dutch contemporary would have been \ran excellent cry to raise. As it is, Milton\'s biographers and \rcontemporaries Phillips, Aubrey, Toland, Antony a Wood, \rare absolutely silent on the subject. Phillips indeed and \rToland expressly mention the languages in which Milton used \rto have works read to him. The list is extensive : it includes \rHebrew, Syriac, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish and French : \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. liii \r\rand it does not include Dutch. I think that this fact tells \rheavily against the hypothesis of Milton\'s indebtedness to \rVondel. Still, it must be admitted that critics of eminence \raccept it. \r\rThere remains the so-called Caedmon Paraphrase. In the \rBodleian is the manuscript of an Old English metrical Para- \rphrase of parts 1 of the Old Testament. This work was long \rattributed to the Northumbrian religious writer Casdmon, of \rwhom Bede speaks. Caedmon lived in the seventh century. \rHe is supposed to have died about 670. There is no reason for \rthinking that he was not the author of sacred poems, as Bede \rrepresents him to have been ; but there is also no possibility of \rbelieving that the Paraphrase, as we have it, was written by \rhim. It is a composite work in which several hands may be \rtraced, and the different styles belong to a date long subsequent \rto Casdmon 2 . The MS. was once in the possession of Archbishop \rUssher. He presented it in 1651 to his secretary, the Teutonic \rscholar, Francis Dujon, commonly called Franciscus Junius. \rJunius published the MS. at Amsterdam in 1655. Milton never \rsaw the Paraphrase in print, for the same reason that he never \rsaw Vondel\'s Lucifer. But inasmuch as Junius had been settled \rin England since 1620, it is quite likely that he knew Milton 3 ; \rif so, he may have mentioned the Paraphrase, and even \rtranslated* parts of it. Here, however, as in the previous cases \rof Andreini and Vondel, we cannot get beyond conjecture, \r\r1 Namely Genesis, Exodus and Daniel. It is the paraphrase of \rGenesis that would have concerned Milton most. \r\r2 See the article by Mr Henry Bradley in the Dictionary of National \rBiography. There is also a good discussion of the authorship of the \rwork in the Appendix to Professor Ten Brink\'s Early English Lite- \rrature. \r\r3 This was first pointed out by Sharon Turner; see also Masson, \rLife, vi. 557. \r\r4 In a very ingenious paper in Anglia, iv. pp. 401 405, Professor \rWuelcker argues that Milton had not much knowledge of Anglo-Saxon. \rIn his History of Britain he habitually quotes Latin Chronicles, and \rin one place virtually admits that an Old English chronicle was not \rintelligible to him. \r\r\r\rliv INTRODUCTION. \r\rsince there is no actual record or external evidence of Milton\'s \racquaintance with the Paraphrase or its translator. \r\rThese then are the four possible \' sources \' of Paradise Lost \rseemingly most deserving of mention ; and of them the Adamus \rExul and the Adamo strike me as unquestionably the most \rimportant, for various reasons. Milton\'s acquaintance with them \rmay be referred to the early period when the influence on him \rof other writers would be greatest. The Adamus and the Adamo \rboth present some points of resemblance to the early drafts of \rParadise Lost. With the Adamus there is the special con- \rsideration of Milton\'s personal knowledge and admiration of \rits author. With the Adamo^ apart from the possibility that \rVoltaire\'s story had some basis, there is the consideration of \rMilton\'s special devotion to Italian literature. With neither is \rthere, at least not in the same degree as in the case of Vondel\'s \rworks and the Csedmon Paraphrase, the difficulty involved by \rthe poet\'s blindness. That he knew the Adamus^ and the Adamo \rappears to me, now, hardly an open question. In these and \rsimilar works disinterred by the industry of Milton\'s editors lay \rthe general conception, the theological machinery, the cosmic \rand supra-cosmic scene of a poem on the Fall of Man. So \rmuch is simply a matter of history ; and to claim for Milton or \rany other writer who chose this theme the merit of absolute \roriginality is simply to ignore history. The composition of \rreligious poetry was the great literary activity of the earlier part \rof the 1 7th century, and Milton did on the grand scale what others \rdid on the lower. The work of these lesser writers could not be \rwithout its influence on him, since no poet can detach himself from \rthe conditions of his age or the associations of a subject that \rhas become common property and passed into a convention. \rBut that the qualities which have made Paradise Lost \rimmortal were due, in the faintest degree, to any other genius \r\r1 As regards the Adamus Exul William Lauder had some case, but \rspoilt it by his forgeries ; for a sample of his libellous malevolence see i. \r7 6!_6 3j note. Todd (n. 585 89) has an Appendix on " Lauder \'s \rInterpolations." \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. lv \r\rthan that of Milton himself: this is a fond delusion, vainly \rimagined, without warranty, and altogether to be cast out. \r\rWe must indeed recognise in Paradise Lost, the meeting- \rpoint of Renaissance and Reformation, the impress of four \rgreat influences : the Bible, the classics, the Italian poets, \rand English literature. Of the Bible Milton possessed a \rknowledge such as few have had. There are hundreds of \rallusions to it : the words of Scripture underlie some part of the \rtext of every page of Paradise Lost ; and apart from verbal \rreminiscences there is much of the spirit that pervades that \rnoblest achievement of the English tongue. Scarcely less \rpowerful was the influence of the classics. Milton\'s allusiveness \rextends over the whole empire of classical humanity and letters, \rand to the scholar his work is full of the exquisite charm of \rendless reference to the noblest things that the ancients have \rthought and said. That he was deeply versed in Italian poetry \rthe labours of his early editors have abundantly proved ; and \rtheir comparative studies are confirmed by the frequent mention \rof Dante 1 , Petrarch, Tasso, Ariosto and others in his prose works \rand correspondence. In English literature I imagine that he \rhad read everything worth reading. Without doubt, he was \r\r1 See Dr Paget Toynbee\'s Dante in English Literature, I. 2, 120, \r486, II. 587. Among the points noted are these : Dante resemblances \roccur in Milton\'s early poems before his visit to Italy ; in his Common- \rplace Book Milton illustrates his views several times by references to \rDante ; his rendering of three lines of the Inferno in his treatise Of \rReformation (see P. L. III. 444 97, note) is the first instance of the use \rof blank verse as a medium for the translation of Dante and may have \rsuggested the use of that metre to Gary ; Milton was one of the first \rEnglish poets to use Dante\'s terza rima see his translation of Psalm ii., \rheaded " Done August 8, 1653. Terzetri." Dr Toynbee also states that \rMilton\'s copy (the 3rd ed., Venice, 1529) of the Convivio is extant: \r" Milton has written his name in the book and the date, 1629. The \rvolume belonged to Heber [the book-collector, half-brother of the \rbishop], and was sold at his sale in 1834." It contained also the \rSonnets (1563) of the Italian poet Casa and the marginal markings, \rif made by Milton, show that he had " read the Sonnets with great \rattention." \r\r\r\rIvi INTRODUCTION. \r\rmost affected by "our admired Spenser 1 ." He was, says \rDryden, "the poetical son of Spenser. Milton has acknow- \rledged to me that Spenser was his original." And there was a \rSpenserian school of poets, mostly Cambridge men, and some \rof them contemporary with Milton at the University, with \rwhose works he evidently had a considerable acquaintance. \rAmong these the two Fletchers were conspicuous Giles \rFletcher, author of the sacred poems Chrisfs Victorie on Earth \rand Chrtsfs Triumph in Heaven ; and Phineas Fletcher, \rauthor of The Purple Island. The influence of the Fletchers \ris manifest in Milton\'s early poems 2 , and it is traceable in \rParadise Lost. Finally, we must not forget Sylvester. Joshua \rSylvester (of whom little is known beyond that he was born in \r1563, died in 1618, and diversified the profession of merchant \rwith the making of much rhyme) translated into exceedingly \rSpenserian verse The Divine Weeks and Works of the French \rpoet, Du Bartas 3 . The subject of this very lengthy work is the \rstory of Creation, with the early history of the Jews. The \rtranslation was amazingly popular. Dryden confessed that he \rhad once preferred Sylvester to Spenser 4 . There is no doubt \r\r1 Animadversions, P. W. in. 84. On Milton\'s feeling for Spenser \rsee the note to // Penseroso, 1 16 20. \r\r3 See the Introductions to Comus and Lycidas. Phineas Fletcher\'s \rApollyonists might also be mentioned (see u. 650, 746, notes). Besides \rthe Fletchers, there was Henry More, the famous " Cambridge \rPlatonist." Milton must have known him at Christ\'s College. \r\r3 Sylvester translated a good deal from Du Bartas beside the Divine \rWeeks ; and rhymed on his own account. The first collected edition of \rhis translation of the Divine Weeks was published in 16051606, \rinstalments having appeared between 1592 and 1599. Dr Grosart \rcollected Sylvester\'s works into two bulky volumes. \r\r4 Spenser himself admired Du Bartas greatly; see the Envoy \raddressed to the French poet Bellay at the end of The Ruines of Rome. \r\rIn a paper read before the British Academy on some MS. notes, \r"dealing mainly with the place of astronomy in poetry," by Spenser\'s \rCambridge friend Gabriel Harvey, Professor Gollancz gave the following \rextract referring to Du Bartas and Spenser : \r\r"Mr Digges hath the whole Aquarius of Palingenius by heart, \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. Ivii \r\rthat Milton studied The Divine Weeks in his youth. " That Poem \rhath ever had many great admirers among us " is the suggestive \rcomment of his nephew Edward Phillips. It is certainly one \rof the works 1 whereof account must be taken in any attempt to \restimate the literary influences that moulded Milton\'s style. \r\rBut a writer may be influenced by others, and not \'pla- \rgiarise\'; and it is well to remember that from Vergil downwards \rthe great poets have exercised their royal right of adapting the \rwords of their forerunners and infusing into them a fresh charm \rand suggestion, since in allusion lies one of the chief delights of \rliterature. It is well, also, to realise wherein lies the greatness \rof Paradise Lost, and to understand that all the borrowing in \rthe world could not contribute a jot to the qualities which have \rrendered the epic " a possession for ever." What has made the \rpoem live is not the story, nobly though that illustrates the \reternal antagonism of righteousness and wrong, and the over- \rthrow of evil ; nor the construction, though this is sufficiently \rarchitectonic ; nor the learning, though this is vast ; nor the \rcharacterisation, for which there is little scope : not these things, \rthough all are factors in the greatness of the poem, and in all \rMilton rises to the height of his argument but the incom- \rparable elevation of the style, " the shaping spirit of Imagina- \rtion, " and the mere majesty of the music. \r\rand takes much delight to repeat it often. Mr Spenser conceives the \rlike pleasure in the fourth day of the first Week of Bartas which he \resteems as the proper profession of Urania." \r\r1 See some remarks and illustrations in Professor Mackail\'s The \rSprings of Helicon (1909), pp. 195, 196. \r\r\r\rP. L. \r\r\r\rIviii INTRODUCTION. \r\r\r\r\\ \r\r\r\rTHE STORY OF THE POEM. \r\r\r\rA sketch of the action of the whole poem, following the \rsequence of the twelve books, may be useful to those who are \racquainted only with parts of Paradise Lost : \r\rI. The scene Hell the time nine days after the expulsion \rof Satan and his followers from Heaven. They lie on the \rburning lake, stupefied. Satan first recovers, rouses Beelzebub, \rdiscusses with him their position, and then makes his way from \rthe lake to a " dreary plain " of dry land. Beelzebub follows ; \rSatan calls to his comrades to do likewise. Rising on the wing \rthey reach the same firm land. Their numbers and names \rdescribed. They range themselves in battle-array before Satan, \rwho addresses them. They may still (he says) regain Heaven ; \ror there may be other worlds to win in particular, a new world, \rinhabited by new-created beings, of which report had spoken : \rlet these matters be duly conferred of. Straightway, a vast \rpalace Pandemonium is made, to serve as council-chamber. \rHere a council is held ; only the great Angels are present. \r\rII. The scene at first Pandemonium ; the debate begins. \rSatan invites their counsel "who can advise may speak." \rMoloch, Belial and Mammon speak their several counsels : \rlast Beelzebub, who reverts to Satan\'s hint of the new world. \rWhy not ruin it ? or make it their own ? or win its inhabitants \rto their side? What better revenge against the Almighty? \rThe plan approved but who will discover this world ? None \rvolunteer : and then Satan offers to undertake the journey. \rHis offer accepted; the council leaving Pandemonium breaks \rup ; the result announced to the rest of the Angels. How they \rpass the time till his return some exploring Hell (now more \rclosely described). Meanwhile he reaches Hell-gates, is suffered \rto pass by Sin and Death, voyages through Chaos (described), \rand at last comes within sight of the Universe hung in space \r(i.e. Chaos). We leave him directing his course towards the \rWorld. \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. lix \r\rIII. The scene at first Heaven. The Almighty perceives \rSatan, points him out to the Son, tells what his design is, and \rits destined success ; tells also that Man will be saved ultimately \rif he can find a Redeemer. " The Son of God freely offers \rhimself a ransom for Man " ; is accepted by the Father, and \rpraised by the Angelic host. Meanwhile the scene changing \rSatan, having reached the outer surface (described) of the \rUniverse, wanders through various regions (described), until, \rcoming to the single opening in the surface, he descends into \rthe inside of the Universe. He arrives at the sphere of the \rSun ; disguising himself as a young Angel from Heaven, en- \rquires from Uriel, the Sun-spirit, the way to Earth pretending \r" desire to behold the new Creation " ; is directed by Uriel, \rdescends again, and alights on Mt Niphates. \r\rIV. There, pausing awhile, he gives way to regret that he \rhas rebelled, and rage at his outcast state ; passion distorts his \rface, so that Uriel, watching, now knows him for an evil spirit. \rThence, recovering self-control, Satan journeys on towards \rEden, the main scene (described) ; sees Adam and Eve (famous \rdescription of them) ; overhears what they say concerning the \rTree of Knowledge, and perceives at once the means whereby \rto compass their fall At nightfall he essays to tempt Eve in a \rdream ; is discovered by Gabriel, who, warned by Uriel, has \rdescended to Eden to defend Man. A battle between Satan \rand Gabriel imminent, but averted. Satan flies. \r\rV The scene still Eden. A further picture of Adam and \rEve their worship and work. Raphael (the scene having \rchanged for a brief space to Heaven) comes to warn them of \rtheir danger, at the bidding of the Almighty so that Man, if he \rfalls, may fall knowingly, by his own fault. Raphael received \rand entertained ; admonishes Adam ; explains who his enemy \ris, and why . which leads to an account of the rebellion in \rHeaven its beginning described. \r\rVI. The scene of the events narrated by Raphael Heaven. \rHe describes the three days\' war in Heaven, at the end of which \rSatan and his followers were cast into Hell. The warning to \rAdam repeated. \r\r\r\rx INTRODUCTION. \r\rVII. The scene Eden. Raphael describes the Creation of \rthe World, which is accomplished by the Son of God. \r\rVIII. The scene the same. Adam enquires concerning \rthe stars and Heavenly bodies ; Raphael answers doubtfully. \rAdam recounts his own first experience of Eden how the \rAlmighty forbade him to touch the Tree of Knowledge, under \rpain of what penalty ; how he first saw Eve. The day declines, \rand Raphael departs once more warning Adam. \r\rIX. The scene the same. "Adam and Eve... go forth to \rtheir labours, which Eve proposes to divide in several places, \reach labouring apart." Adam dissuades ; she persisting, he \ryields. So Satan (in the form of a serpent) finds her alone and \rtempts her. She eats of the fruit and induces Adam to do so. \rTheir sense of sin and shame. \r\rX. The Son of God descends to Eden, and pronounces \rdoom on Adam and Eve and the Serpent. Meanwhile Satan, \rreturning to Pandemonium, announces the result of his journey, \rand lo ! on a sudden he and his followers are changed to reptiles. \rSin and Death now ascend from Hell to Eden, to claim the \rWorld as theirs ; but the Almighty foretells their ultimate over- \rthrow by the Son, and commands the Angels to make changes \rin the elements and stars, whereby the Earth becomes less fair. \rThe repentance of Adam and Eve, who seek comfort in suppli- \rcation of the Deity. The scene has changed often. \r\rXI. The Son interceding, the Father sends Michael to \rEden (henceforth the scene) to reveal the future to Adam \rabove all, his hope of redemption. After announcing to Adam \rhis approaching banishment from Eden, Michael takes him to a \rhigh mountain and unrolls before him a vision of the World\'s \rhistory till the Flood. \r\rXII. Then he traces the history of Israel after the Flood, \rtill the coming of Christ, with the subsequent progress of Chris- \rtianity : ending with renewed promise of redemption. The fiery \rCherubim now descend. Michael leads Adam and Eve to the \rgates of Eden ; and they go forth, sad yet consoled with the \rhope of salvation at the last. \r\r\r\r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. Ixi \r\r\r\rMILTON\'S PREFACE ON "THE VERSE "OF \rPARADISE LOST. \r\rMilton\'s attitude towards rhyme reminds us of the condem- \rnations showered on it by Elizabethan critics. Ascham in the \rSchoolmaster (1570) sneers at "our rude beggerly ryming, brought \rfirst into Italic by Gothes and Hunnes, whan all good verses \rand all good learning to, were destroyed by them... and at last \rreceyued into England by men of excellent wit indeede, but of \rsmall learning, and lesse judgement in that behalfe." "Barba- \rrous " is his darling epithet for rhymed verse. Puttenham is of \ra like mind, waving aside " the rhyming poesie of the barbarians,\'"\' \rand Webbe in his Discourse of English Poetry (1586) takes up \rthe tale, ridiculing it as " tinkerly verse " " brutish poesie " \r" a great decay of the good order of versifying." Why Milton \rshould have adopted the same position as these Elizabethan \rcritics who approached the question in a spirit of the merest \rpedantry, and based their objections to rhyme solely on the \rfact that, as a metrical principle, it was not employed by the \rancients, it is not easy to say. He uses rhyme occasionally in \rSamson Agonistes, in spite of his denunciation of it here ; and \rhis own early poems are sufficient refutation of the heresy that \rtherein lies " no true musical delight." Moreover, though he \rappeals to the example of some European poets " 01 prime \rnote" in support of his view, yet he must have foreseen the \robvious and just retort that the weight of " custom " was against \rhim, and that, in particular, the Italian exponents 01 versi \rsciolti whom he could cite on his side made a poor showing \rbeside those great masters of rhyme Dante, Ariosto, Tasso 1 \rto whom he himself owed so much. His contemptuous dis- \rmissal of what " in every country of modern Europe had been \radopted as the basis of metrical composition 2 " was ^character- \ristic touch of his resentment of criticism and defiance of \rauthority. \r\r1 See, however, p. 367. \r\r2 Courthope. \r\r\r\rIxii INTRODUCTION. \r\rThere is a polemical tone in his remarks, as though he were \rreplying to some unnamed antagonist ; and I cannot help \rthinking that this preface was meant to be his contribution to \rthe controversy then raging over the comparative advantages of \rrhymed and unrhymed metres on the stage. In fact, significant \rin itself, Milton\'s opinion becomes doubly so if regarded from \rthe standpoint of his contemporaries. Hardly could they fail to \rsee in it a retort to what Dryden had written in the behalf of \rrhyme notably in his Essay of Dramatic Poesy (1665), in \rwhich the rhymed couplet had been set forth as the best vehicle \rof dramatic expression. In play after play Dryden had put his \rtheory into practice : others had followed his example : to \rrhyme or not to rhyme that had become the great question; \rand here was Milton brushing the matter on one side as of no \rmoment, with the autocratic dictum that rhyme was a vain and \rfond thing with which a " sage and serious " poet need have no \rcommerce. His readers must have detected the contemporary \rapplication of his words just as later on they must have \rinterpreted his preface to Samson Agonistes, with its pointed \reulogy of the Greek stage and its depreciation of Restoration \rtragedy (and "other common interludes"), as a counterblast to \rthe comparison which Dryden had drawn between the modern \rand the classical drama, in the interests of the former. There \ris force too in the suggestion that the association of rhyme \rwith the amatory Caroline poets (Lycidas, 67 69) would not \rmake Milton more favourable to it. \r\rCuriously enough, Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained\\)Q\\h \rcontain a good deal of rhyme. We may compare it with the rare \rrhymed verse, accidental or designed (" leonine "), in the Latin \rpoets. Cowper noted some instances in his fragment of a com- \rmentary on Paradise Lost. " Rhyme," he said, " is apt to come \runcalled, and to writers of blank verse is often extremely trouble- \rsome 1 .\'\'\' Indeed complete absence of rhyme argues some artifici- \rality. To quote Mr Robert Bridges: "Rhyme occurs in. Paradise \r\r1 "The blank verse Italians have often done this [i.e. rhymed] : in \rfact, it is excessively difficult to prevent in Italian " (Saintsbury). \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. Ixiii \r\rL0st(see l. 146, 8, 51; II. 220, i; IV. 2427), but only as a natural \rrichness among the varieties of speech ; and it would seem that \rit cannot be forbidden in a long poem but by the scrupulosity \rwhich betrays art." Possibly, however, the amount of rhyme \rin the two epics exceeds what Milton would have desired. It \rillustrates, I think, the terrible difficulty of revision imposed by \rhis blindness. Yet such is the spell of the rhythm of his verse \rthat one may be unconscious of the rhyme till its presence \ris pointed out. Of consecutive rhymed lines, some being actual \rrhymed couplets, the following passages are examples : Paradise \rLost, ii. 220, 221 ; iv. 956, 957 ; vi. 709, 710 ; ix. 105, 106, 477, \r478; XI. 230, 231, 597, 598, 671, 672; Paradise Regained, in. 214, \r215; IV. 591, 592. In ii. 893, 894, a slight difference of pronun- \rciation, indicated by Milton\'s spelling, may account for what \rappears to the eye as a couplet. In v. 167, 168, 274, 275, \rIX. 191, 192, the assonance has the effect of rhyme. Of course, \rthe most frequent rhyme is that which comes with an interval of \rone or two intervening lines, as in two out of the three passages \rremarked by Mr Bridges. Other examples 1 are: Paradise Lost, \rI. 274, 276, 711,7135 764, 767; II. 390, 393, 942, 9445 ni. 140, 142, \r\rl68, 170; IV. 222, 224, 288, 290, 678, 680; V. 1 60, 162, 383, 385, \r\r857, 859; vi. 14, 1 6, 161, 163, 174, 176; viii. i, 3, 171, 173, 229, \r\r231; IX. 590, 591, 606, 608; XL 201, 204, 206, 637, 639, 740, 741; \r\rXIL 353, 355> 366, 368; Paradise Regained, II. 206, 208, 245, 247, \r250; IV. 25, 27, 145, 147, 222, 224. As remarked before, I cannot \rhelp thinking that a portion of this rhyme represents Milton\'s \rinability to focus the full measure of his fastidious taste 2 on the \rrevision of his work. \r\rSuperfluous as it may seem to us that he should justify his \radoption of blank verse wherein his surpassing skill is the \rbest of all justifications we have cause to be grateful to the \r"stumblings" of the unlettered which led him to write this \r\r1 The list is illustrative, not exhaustive. \r\r2 It would have resented surely the substitution of Chersonese in \rmost modern texts for the Chersoness of the original editions in \rParadise Regained, iv. 74. See the termination of the previous line. \r\r\r\rIxiv INTRODUCTION. \r\rpreface, since it happily defines the qualities for which the metre \rof Paradise Lost is remarkable. \r\rThe distinguishing characteristic of Milton\'s blank verse is \rhis use of what Mr Saintsbury calls the verse-paragraph. \rBlank verse is exposed to two dangers : it may be formal and \rstiff by being circumscribed in single lines or couplets; or \rdiffuse and formless through the sense and rhythm being carried \ron beyond the couplet. In its earlier stages, exemplified by \rworks like Gorboduc, the metre suffered from the former \rtendency. It either closed with a strong pause at the end of \revery line, or just struggled to the climax of the couplet. \rFurther it never extended until Marlowe took the " drumming \rdecasyllabon " into his hands, broke up the fetters of the \rcouplet-form, and by the process of overflow carried on the \rrhythm from verse to verse according as the sense required. \rIt is in his plays that we first get verse in which variety of \rcadence and pause and beat takes the place of rhyme. Milton \rentered on the heritage that Marlowe and Shakespeare be- \rqueathed, and brought blank verse to its highest pitch of \rperfection as an instrument of narration. \r\rBriefly, that perfection lies herein : if we examine a page of \rParadise Lost we find that what the poet has to say is, for the \rmost part, conveyed, not in single lines, nor in rigid couplets \rbut in flexible combinations of verses, which wait upon his \rmeaning, not twisting or constraining the sense, but suffering it \rto be " variously drawn out," so that the thought is merged in \rits expression. \r\rThese combinations, or paragraphs, are informed by a \rperfect internal concent and rhythm 1 held together by a chain \rof harmony With a writer less sensitive to sound this free \rmethod of versifying would result in mere chaos. But Milton\'s \rear is so delicate, that he steers unfaltering through the long, \rinvolved passages, distributing the pauses and rests and allitera- \r\r1 Cf. Professor Mackail\'s fine metaphor for it "the planetary \rwheeling of the long period " " that continuous planetary movement" \r(Lecture II. on Milton in The Springs of Helicon, pp. 156, 196). \r\r\r\r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. Ixv \r\rtive balance with a cunning which knits the paragraph into a \rcoherent, regulated whole. He combines, in fact, the two es- \rsential qualities of blank verse freedom and form : the freedom \rthat admits variety of effect, without which a long narrative \rbecomes intolerably monotonous ; and the form which saves an \runrhymed measure from drifting into that which is nearer to \rbad prose than to good verse. And restoration of form was \rprecisely what the metre needed. With the later Jacobean and \rCaroline dramatists metrical freedom had turned to "licence \rand slipshodness...then comes Milton,... takes non-dramatic \rblank verse in hand once for all, and introduces into it the \rorder, proportion, and finish which dramatic blank verse had \rthen lost 1 ." Milton in fact was the re-creator of blank verse, \r" the first to establish this peculiarly English form of metre in \rnon-dramatic poetry 1 ." Nor was he unconscious of the character \rof his achievement. Here, in the last lines of his preface, he \rcongratulates himself upon "an example set"; and many years \rbefore, in the grand passage apostrophising the Divine Goodness \rat the end of the treatise Of Reformation, he had written, with \robvious reference to the great design that ruled his whole life : \r" Then, amidst the hymns and hallelujahs of saints, some one \rmay perhaps be heard offering at high strains in new and \rlofty measure to sing and celebrate thy divine mercies and \rmarvellous judgments in this land throughout all ages 2 ." It \rwere hard to frame an apter summary of the metre of Paradise \rLost than "-new and lofty." \r\rAs he lays such stress upon the internal economy and \rbalance of his verse-paragraphs, much must depend on the \rpause or rest which in English prosody answers, to some extent, \rto the classical ccesura. Dr Masson notes that Milton\'s favourite \rpause is at the end of the third foot. These are typical \rspecimens : \r\r"I, at first, with two fair gifts \rCreated him endowed | with happiness \r\r1 Saintsbury, History of English Prosody, n. pp. 208, 224. \r\r2 P. W. ii. 418. \r\r\r\rIxvi INTRODUCTION. \r\rAnd immortality; | that fondly lost, \rThis other served but to eternize woe, \rTill I provided death : | so death becomes \rHis final remedy" | (xi. 57 62). \r\rNext in frequency comes the pause after the second foot; cf. \r\r"ere fallen \rFrom innocence " | (xi. 29, 30). \r\r" Made one with me, | as I with thee am one " (xi. 44). \r\rScarcely need we say that in this, as in everything else, \rMilton never forgets that variety of effect is essential. \r\rIt remains to note two other remarks made by Milton. \rOne of the elements, he says, of "true musical delight" is \r"fit quantity of syllables." By this, I think, he meant that \revery word should bear its natural accent, i.e. that a word \rshould not be forced by the exigence of the metre to bear \ran accent alien to it. Rather, a poet should be careful to \r"span words with just note and accent 1 ," so that each stress \rshould fall naturally, and the " fit quantity " of the component \rparts of a line not be violated. Considering the length of \rParadise Lost, it is marvellous how he maintains an unfaltering \rappropriateness of accent. But another interpretation of his \rwords is possible, namely that by " fit quantity of syllables " he \rmeant "that blank verse might be extended beyond the usual \rnumber of ten syllables when its sense and feeling so required 2 ." \rTaken in this way, "quantity" would have reference to the \rtrisyllabic element in his verse by which the number of syllables \rin a line is increased, and perhaps more obviously to the \rhypermetrical element. \r\rOne peculiarity of the metre of Paradise Lost, pointed out \rby Coleridge, is the rarity of verses with an extra syllable (or \rtwo extra syllables) at the close. Shakespeare, of course, uses \r\r1 Sonnet to Henry Lawes. \r\r2 Courthope, History of English Poetry, III. 428. Personally I \rthink that in a specifically metrical context " quantity " conveys the \rnotion "long" or "short," i.e. with or without accent (stress). \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. Ixvii \r\rthem freely especially in his later plays, and the percentage of \rthem in Comus and Samson Agonistes is high. But in Paradise \rLost Milton avoids them. There are several varieties of this \rextra-syllable verse e.g. lines (i) where the supernumerary \rsyllable comes at the close ; (ii) where it comes in the course \rof the line, particularly after the second foot ; (iii) where there \rare two extra syllables at the end, as in the line, "Like one j that \rmeans | his projper harm, | in ?s\\&.nacles" (Coriolanus, I. 9. 57) ; \rand (iv) where there are two extra syllables in the middle, as in \rCoriolanus, I. i. 230, "Our must|y su|perfluz/y |. See our | best \relders." In Comus there are examples of all four varieties : in \rParadise Lost of only two 1 (i) and (iii). This paucity is an \rillustration of what must be recognised as. the great metrical \rfeature of the epic that its metre is mainly iambic, and conse- \rquently decasyllabic in character. Such verse has a slower, \rstatelier movement, and is therefore appropriate to a narrative \rpoem that deals with the loftiest themes in an elevated, solemn \rstyle. Verse, on the other hand, that admits the supernumerary \rsyllable at the close of the line tends towards a conversational \rrapidity of rhythm which makes it suitable for the purposes of \rthe dramatist. It is typical of Milton\'s "inevitable," almost \rinfallible, art that he should vary his style so precisely to fit the \rseveral characteristics and requirements of the drama and of \repic narration. Such variation illustrates "a quality for which \rhe seldom or never gets the full credit due to him, a dramatic \rsense of extreme delicacy. With him, as with Sophocles, this \rquality is so fine that it may easily elude observation 2 ." \r\rAgain, another element of the pleasure offered by poetry \rlies in "apt numbers." Here Milton referred to that adaptation \rof expression to subject whereby the sound becomes an echo to \rthe sense. This adaptation is shown in its simplest form by the \r\r1 In most of the cases of one extra syllable it ,is a present participle \rthat is affected. I believe that the cases with two such syllables are \rin Milton confined to words like society ; cf. P. R. I. 302, " Such \rsolitude before choicest socutfy." So in P. L. vill. 216. Of course in \rthese cases an " Alexandrine " solves the difficulty. \r\r2 The Springs of Helicon, p. 175 (see also p. 178). \r\r\r\rIxviii INTRODUCTION. \r\rsuggestion of specific effects such as movement or sound 1 . \rBut it dominates the whole relation of the manner to the matter. \rNo one has understood the art of blending the thought with \rits expression better than Milton. " What other poets effect,\' 3 \rsays Dr Guest 2 , "as it were by chance, Milton achieved by the \raid of science and art ; he studied the aptness of his numbers, \rand diligently tutored an ear which nature had gifted with the \rmost delicate sensibility. In the flow of his rhythm, in the \rquality of his letter sounds, in the disposition of his pauses, his \rverse almost ever fits the subject, and so insensibly does \rpoetry blend with this the last beauty of exquisite versifica- \rtion that the reader may sometimes doubt whether it be the \rthought itself, or merely the happiness of its expression, which \ris the source of a gratification so deeply felt." \r\rWe have seen that Milton may have had in view the scan- \rsion of his verse when he referred to the "fit quantity of syllables." \rThat scansion has as its basic principle the "pure iambic" \rcarmen iambicum so much canvassed by Elizabethan metricists. \rThis stately, self-contained line of five feet in rising rhythm \r"O Prince, O chief of many throned powers " lies at the centre \rof the prosody of Paradise Lost. So much is patent; nor are the \rmain means by which it is varied obscure. By letting the lines \rrun on so that the rhythm of the unit of five feet passes into the \rricher harmony of groups of units Milton gives us the "verse- \rparagraph." And by substituting each of the possible variations \rof the disyllabic foot namely, the trochee (or inversion of \rrhythm), the spondee and the pyrrhic he tempers the monotony \rof a single-foot measure to " stops of various quills." But these \rfoot-modifications had become part of the machinery of blank \r\r1 Cf. e.g. i. 742 46, 768, ii. 947 50, 1021, 1022, vii. 495 (note), \rX. 521 28 (note). So in II. 641 we get the sense of vast space; in n. \r879 83 of combined movement and jarring noise ; in n. 890 906 of \rconfusion; iniv. i8i(note) of scornful laughter; in vii. 480 of length. \rA very elaborate example (admirably analysed in Mayor\'s Modern \rEnglish Metre, pp. 99 106) is the description of the march of the fallen \rangels in I. 549 62. \r\r2 English Rhythms, p. 530. \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. Ixix \r\rverse as developed since the pioneer days. There is nothing \rspecifically Miltonic about the use of them in Paradise Lost, \rexcept possibly as regards the spondee. Cowper was in- \rclined to think that " the grand secret to which his [Milton\'s] \rverse is principally indebted for its stately movement " is the \rfrequent employment of spondaic feet : " the more long syllables \rthere are in a verse, the more the line of it is protracted, and \rconsequently the pace, with which it moves, is the more majestic." \rThat Milton\'s use of the trochee (or rare double trochee) was \rdue to the partiality of the Italians for this foot seems a needless \rassumption, the trochee having been firmly established by \rMarlowe. And "pyrrhic" is merely a rather pedantic-sounding \rterm for a quite ordinary feature of blank verse namely, the \roccurrence of a foot with a weak stress. Dr Abbott estimates \rthat of Shakespeare\'s lines " rather less than one of three has \rthe full number of five emphatic accents." I doubt whether the \rinstances are so frequent in Milton; but they are sufficiently \rcommon to make it desirable to remember that five stresses are \rnot indispensable rather that for variety\'s sake it is necessary \rthat one or more should occasionally be remitted. Taken as a \rwhole, the obviously disyllabic element of Milton\'s poetry does \rnot present much difficulty : the crux lies in the less obviously \rtrisyllabic strata. \r\rThis is a subject on which irreconcilable opinions are held ; \rthe Miltonic blank verse described by Dr Masson is simply a \rdifferent thing from the Miltonic blank verse described by Mr \rBridges ; and the essential truth seems to me to lie very much \rnearer to the views of the latter critic. I think that Milton \rhimself would have been astonished at the elaborate trisyllabic \rapparatus bacchics and amphibrachs and cretics rare with \rwhich the verse of Paradise Lost has been credited. The base- \rprinciple of the slow-moving, majestic iambic decasyllabic is \rlost in the mazes of so complex a system. On the other hand, \rto attempt to ban the trisyllabic foot altogether from his metre \rinvolves impossible twistings and distortions. We shall not be \rfar astray if we steer a middle course and admit the anapaest \r\r\r\rIxx INTRODUCTION. \r\r(" the foot-of-all-work of English prosody ") and (to a much less \rimportant share) the dactyl and the tribrach 1 . These may be \rtaken to represent collectively "the trisyllabic foot, which was \rinherent in the nature of the [English] language, and had \rbeen recognised by long poetical usage 2 ." It reproduces "the \rswift triple rhythm 2 " of Old English poetry, while the iambic \relement corresponds with the typical movement of the Greek \rsenarius. And in the verse of Paradise Lost it is the iambic \rmovement that prevails, especially perhaps in the first six books, \rwhich are cast more in the typically grand Miltonic manner \rthan the second half of the poem, where the less impressive \rand less coherent interest of the subject is reflected in the style. \rBut the measure of this iambic predominance depends on the \rdegree to which the principle of elision of vowels applies. \r\r"Elision" comprehends not merely the cases where a vowel \rmust be dropped altogether in pronunciation, but those more \rnumerous cases where the metre indicates, or seems to indicate, \rthat a vowel has something less than its normal quantitative \rvalue, so that it is either slurred or made almost to coalesce \rwith a preceding or succeeding sound. Such elision resolves \ritself practically into cases of the open vowel and the vowel \r(or double vowel) followed by a liquid. Elision of the former \rtype belongs to poetic usage, of the latter to the currency \rof everyday speech ; and each is permissive, not obligatory. \rMoreover, elision is a matter of scansion, not necessarily of \rpronunciation and reading. It is, I think, perfectly true to say \rthat "Milton came to scan his verses one way, and read \rthem another." But is it not true of all poetic elision ? Who \r\r1 See Saintsbury, A History of English Prosody, I. 403, II. -259, 260. \r\r2 Courthope. Compare also Mayor (Modem English Metre, p. 15): \r"Anapaestic rhythm was familiar to the Elizabethan poets, not merely \rfrom its use by older writers, such as the author of Piers Ploughman, \rbut from the later \' tumbling verse \' as used by Skelton and Udall." \rAnd again (p. 44): "Trisyllabic rhythm is a marked feature of the \rOld English alliterative verse, and of the * tumbling measure \' which \rfollowed it." \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. Ixxi \r\rknows what precisely happened to the elided vowels of Greek \rand Latin verse ? Metrically their suppression may have been \rabsolute, as it is (I am told) in Greek MSS. : but in actual \rdeclamation? Similarly, though I cannot doubt that Milton \r\rscanned "th\' Aonian mount" and "th\' oblivious pool," yet I \rshould not like to say that he read the words so. Nor should I \rlike to have to determine whether in scansion he extended this \rprinciple of the elision of the open vowel beyond monosyllables \rlike the and to and the terminally which slides so easily into a \rvowel at the beginning of the next word. Thus it satisfies my \r\r"gross unpurged ear" to scan "Who highly thus t\' entitle me \rvouchsaf\'st" (X. 170) ; but to wrest an iambus out of the second \rfoot of the line " Virtue in her shape how lovely ; saw and pined " \r(IV. 848) by eliding the double vowel ue (" Virtue in | her shape") \rseems a needless violence, when the easy access of the anapaest \r(" Virtue | in her shape ") solves all. And so with many another \rline. \r\rSome light is thrown on this difficult question of Milton\'s \relisions by the Cambridge autographs of his earlier poems. The \revidence, indeed, is not conclusive because the MSS. are not \rconsistent in giving always an elided form where the metre \rrequires one as an alternative to a trisyllabic scansion. But one \rcannot help drawing some, inference from elisions like "Tem- \rper\'d to th\' oaten flute," and elided forms such as watrie \rivestringbatning -juandring toured, and the many con- \rtractions of the inflections of verbs, such as honour\'st turtst \rforttnur\'ststooptstolne dan\'ct\\ With some of these \rexamples before us, it is not hard to conjecture how Milton \rwould have scanned, say, Paradise Lost, xi. 779, " Wandering \rthat watery desert ; I had hope." Similarly when we come \racross lines of the epic in which Heaven appears to be equivalent \rto a monosyllable, it is apposite to remember that his autograph \rhas heavn in the prose draft of Adam unparaditfd (line 2). \r\r1 Cf. Lycidas, 4, 12, 23, 29, 31, 33; Arcades^ 21; Cornus, 39; \rSonnets n. and XIII. \r\r\r\rIxxii INTRODUCTION. \r\r\r\r# in the prose draft of Isaac redeemd serves as a metrical \rgloss on i. 84, " If thou beest he but Oh how fallen ! how \rchanged ! " The drift of such elisions and contractions is \robviously to diminish the trisyllabic element, and maintain that \riambic rhythm which was ever present 1 to Milton\'s ear and ever \rwafting the proud full sail of his verse. \r\r1 Two groups of exceptions to the general movement of his lines \rhave been remarked, viz. passages where he indulges his taste for \rsonorous proper names, and passages " where he follows the Authorised \rVersion of the Bible especially where the speaker is the Deity." \r\r\r\rCOMMENDATORY VERSES. \r\r\r\rIN PARADISUM AMISSAM SUMMI \rJOHANNIS MILTONI. \r\r\r\rOui legis Amissam Paradisum, grandia magni \r\rCarmina Miltoni, quid nisi cuncta legis? \rRes cunctas, et cunctarum primordia rerum, \r\rEt fata, et fines, continet iste liber. \rIntima panduntur magni penetralia mundi, \r\rScribitur et toto quicquid in orbe latet ; \rTerraeque, tractusque maris, ccelumque profundum, \r\rSulphureumque Erebi flammivomumque specus; \rQuaeque colunt terras, pontumque, et Tartara caeca, \r\rQuaeque colunt summi lucida regna poli ; 10 \r\rEt quodcunque ullis conclusum est finibus usquam ; \r\rEt sine fine Chaos, et sine fine Deus ; \rEt sine fine magis, si quid magis est sine fine, \r\rIn Christo erga homines conciliatus amor. \rHaec qui speraret quis crederet esse futurum? \r\rEt tamen haec hodie terra Britanna legit. \rO quantos in bella duces, quae protulit arma! \r\rQuae canit, et quanta, praelia dira tuba! \rCcelestes acies, atque in certamine ccelum! \r\rEt quae coelestes pugna deceret agros! 20 \r\rQuantus in setheriis tollit se Lucifer armis, \r\rAtque ipso graditur vix Michaele minor! \r\rP.

B., M.D. \r\r\r\rON PARADISE LOST. \r\rWHEN I beheld the Poet blind, yet bold, \r\rIn slender book his vast design unfold, \r\rMessiah crowned, God\'s reconciled decree, \r\rRebelling Angels, the Forbidden Tree, \r\rHeaven, Hell, Earth, Chaos, all ; the argument \r\rHeld me a while misdoubting his intent, \r\rThat he would ruin (for I saw him strong) \r\rThe sacred truths to fable and old song \r\r(So Samson groped the temple\'s posts in spite), \r\rThe world o\'ei whelming to revenge his sight. 10 \r\r\r\rCOMMENDATORY VERSES. 3 \r\rYet as I read, soon growing less severe, \rI liked his project, the success did fear; \rThrough that wide field how he his way should find \rO\'er which lame Faith leads Understanding blind ; \rLest he perplexed the things he would explain, \rAnd what was easy he should render vain. \r\rOr, if a work so infinite he spanned, \rJealous I was that some less skilful hand \r(Such as disquiet always what is well, \rAnd by ill imitating would excel) 20 \r\rMight hence presume the whole Creation\'s day \rTo change in scenes, and show it in a play. \r\rPardon me, mighty Poet; nor despise \rMy causeless, yet not impious, surmise. \rBut I am now convinced, and none will dare \rWithin thy labours to pretend a share. \rThou hast not missed one thought that could be fit, \rAnd all that was improper dost omit ; \rSo that no room is here for writers left, \rBut to detect their ignorance or theft. 30 \r\rThat majesty which through thy work doth reign \rDraws the devout, deterring the profane. \rAnd things divine thou treat\'st of in such state \rAs them preserves, and thee, inviolate. \rAt once delight and horror on us seize ; \rThou sing\'st with so much gravity and ease, \rAnd above human flight dost soar aloft \rWith plume so strong, so equal, and so soft. \rThe bird named from that Paradise you sing \rSo never flags, but always keeps on wing. 4^ \r\rWhere could\'st thou words of such a compass find? \rWhence furnish such a vast expense of mind? \rJust Heaven, thee like Tiresias to requite, \rRewards with prophecy thy loss of sight. \r\rWell might\'st thou scorn thy readers to allure \rWith tinkling rime, of thy own sense secure ; \r\rI 2 \r\r\r\rCOMMENDATORY VERSES. \r\rWhile the Town-Bayes writes all the while and spells, \r\rAnd, like a pack-horse, tires without his bells. \r\rTheir fancies like our bushy points appear; \r\rThe poets tag them, we for fashion wear. 50 \r\rI too, transported by the mode, offend, \r\rAnd while I meant to praise thee, must commend. \r\rThy verse created like thy theme sublime, \r\rIn number, weight, and measure, needs not rime. \r\rA. M. \r\r\r\rTHE VERSE 1 . \r\r\r\rThe measure is English heroic verse, without rime, as that \rof Homer in Greek, and of Virgil in Latin; rime being no \rnecessary adjunct or true ornament of poem or good verse, in \rlonger works especially, but the invention of a barbarous age, to \rset off wretched matter and lame metre ; graced indeed since by \rthe use of some famous modern poets, carried away by custom, \rbut much to their own vexation, hindrance, and constraint to \rexpress many things otherwise, and for the most part worse, \rthan else they would have expressed them. Not without cause, \rtherefore, some both Italian and Spanish poets of prime note \rhave rejected rime both in longer and shorter works, as have \ralso, long since, our best English tragedies ; as a thing of itself, \rto all judicious ears, trivial and of no true musical delight ; \rwhich consists only in apt numbers, fit quantity of syllables, \rand the sense variously drawn out from one verse into another, \rnot in the jingling sound of like endings, a fault avoided by the \r\r1 Preceded by some remarks from the publisher: \rThe Printer to the Reader. \r\rCourteous Reader^ there was no Argument at first intended to the \rbook; but for the satisfaction of many that have desired it, I have \rprocured it, and withal a reason of that which stumbled many others, \rwhy the poem rimes not. S. Simmons. \r\r\r\r6 TJII; VERSE. \r\rlearned ancients both in poetry and all good oratory. This \rneglect then of rime so little is to be taken for a defect, though \rit may seem so perhaps to vulgar readers, that it rather is to be \resteemed an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty \rrecovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and modern \rbondage of riming. \r\r\r\rBOOK I. \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\rThis First Book proposes, first in brief, the whole subject, Man\'s \rdisobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise, wherein he was \rplaced : then touches the prime cause of his fall, the Serpent, or rather \rSatan in the Serpent; who revolting from God, and drawing to his \rside many legions of Angels, was by the command of God driven out \rof Heaven with all his crew into the great Deep. Which action passed \rover, the Poem hastes into the midst of things; presenting Satan with \rhis Angels now fallen into Hell, described here, not in the Centre (for \rHeaven and Earth may be supposed as yet not made, certainly not yet \raccursed) but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest called Chaos: here \rSatan with his Angels lying on the burning lake, thunderstruck and \rastonished, alter a certain space recovers, as from confusion; calls up \rhim who, next in order and dignity, lay by him ; they confer of their \rmiserable fall. Satan awakens all his legions, who lay till then in the \rsame manner confounded; they rise: their numbers, array of battle, \rtheir chief leaders named, according to the idols known afterwards in \rCanaan and the countries adjoining. To these Satan directs his speech; \rcomforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven; but tells them lastly \rof a new world and new kind of creature to be created, according to an \rancient prophecy or report in Heaven ; for that Angels were long before \rthis visible creation was the opinion of many ancient Fathers. To find \rout the truth of this prophecy, and what to determine thereon, he refers \rto a full council. What his associates thence attempt. Pandemonium, \rthe palace of Satan, rises, suddenly built out of the Deep : the infernal \rPeers there sit in council. \r\r\r\rBOOK I. \r\r\r\rOF Man\'s first disobedience, and the fruit \rOf that forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste \rBrought death into the world, and all our woe, \rWith loss of Eden, till one greater Man \rRestore us, and regain the blissful seat, \rSing, Heavenly Muse, that on the secret top \rOf Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire \rThat shepherd, who first taught the chosen seed \rIn the beginning how the Heavens and Earth \rRose out of Chaos : or, if Sion hill 10 \r\rDelight thee more, and Siloa\'s brook that flowed \rFast by the oracle of God, I thence ^., \rInvoke thy aid to my adventurous song, \rThat with no middle flight intends to soar \rAbove the Aonian mount, while it pursues \rThings unattempted yet in prose or rhyme. \rAnd chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer \rBefore all temples the upright heart and pure, \rInstruct me, for thou know\'st; thou from the first \rWast present, and, with mighty wings outspread, 20 \r\rDove-like sat\'st brooding on the vast Abyss, \rAnd mad\'st it pregnant : what in me is dark \r\r\r\r10 PARADISE LOST. \r\rIllumine, what is low raise and support; \rThat to the highth of this great argument \rI may assert Eternal Providence, \rAnd justify the ways of God to men. \r\rSay first (for Heaven hides nothing from thy view, \rNor the deep tract of Hell) say first what cause \rMoved our grand parents, in that happy state, \rFavoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off 30 \r\rFrom their Creator, and transgress his will \rFor one restraint, lords of the world besides. \rWho first seduced them to that foul revolt? \r\r-The infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile, \rStirred up with envy and revenge, deceived \rThe Mother of Mankind, what time his pride \rHad cast" him 1 out from Heaven, with all his host \rOf rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring \rTo set himself in glory above his peers, \rHe trusted to have equalled the Most High, 40 \r\rIf he opposed; and with ambitious aim \rAgainst the throne and monarchy of God \rRaised impious war in Heaven and battle proud, \rWith vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power \rHurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky, \rWith hideous ruin and combustion, down \r\r| To bottomless perdition; there to dwell \r\rIn adamantine chains and penal fire, \r\rI Who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms. \r\rNine times the space that measures day and night 50 \rTo mortal men, he with his horrid crew \rLay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf, \rConfounded though immortal. But his doom \rReserved him to more wrath; for now the thought jp \rBoth of lost happiness and lasting pain \r\r\r\rBOOK I. II \r\rTorments him ; round he throws his baleful eyes, \r\rThat witnessed huge affliction and dismay, \r\rMixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate. \r\rAt once, as far as Angels ken, he views \r\rThe dismal situation waste and wild: j 60 \r\rI A dungeon horrible, on all sides round, / \r\rone great furnace flamed; yet from those flames \rJo light, but rather darkness visible \rserved only to discover sights of woe, \r\\ Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace \rAnd rest can never dwell, hope never comes \r\\That comes to all ; but torture without end \rStill urges, and a fiery deluge, fed \rWith ever-burning sulphur unconsumed. \rSuch place Eternal Justice had prepared 70 \r\rEorjhose rebellious; here their prison ordained \rIn utter darkness, and their portion set, \rAs far removed from God and light of Heaven \rAs from the centre thrice to the utmost pole. \rOh how unlike the place from whence they fell ! \rThere the companions of his fall, o\'erwhelmed \rWith floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, \rHe soon discerns ; and, weltering by his side, f^j^ \rOne next himself in power, and next in crime, V|, \rLong after known in Palestine, and named \rBeelzebub. To whom the Arch-Enemy, \rAnd thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words \rBreaking the horrid silence, thus began : \r\\ " If thou beest he but Oh how fallen ! how changed \r\\ From him, who in the happy realms of light, \r\\ Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine \r! Myriads, though bright! if he whom mutual \r1 United thoughts and counsels, equal hope \r\r\r\r12 PARADISE LOST. \r\rAnd hazard in the glorious enterprise, \r\rJoined with me once, now misery hath joined 90 \r\rIn equal ruin : into what pit thou seest \r\rFrom what highth fallen, so much the stronger proved \r\rHe with his thunder: and till then who knew \r\rThe force of those dire arms? Yet not for those, \r\rNor what the potent victor in his rage \r\ri Can else inflict, do I repent, or change, \r\rThough changed in outward lustre,, that fixed mind, I \r\rAnd high disdain from sense of injured merit, \\ \r\rThat with the Mightiest raised me to contend, \rAnd to the fierce contention brought along 100 \r\rInnumerable force of Spirits armed, \rThat durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring, \rHis utmost power with adverse power opposed \rIn dubious battle on the plains of Heaven, \rAnd shook his throne. What though the field be lost? \rAlLJs_not; Jpst : the unconquerable will, \rAnd study of revenge, immortal hate, \rAnd courage never to submit or yield: \rAnd what is elsejiot to be overcome? \rThat glory never shall his wrath or might no \r\rExtort from me.

If then his providence \rOut of our evil seek to bring forth good, \rOur labour must be to pervert that end, \rAnd out of good still to find means of evil ; \rWhichjpJtJ.^es may ^succeed, so as perhaps \r\r; Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb \rHis inmost counsels from their destined aim. \rBut see ! the angry victor hath recalled \rHis ministers of vengeance and pursuit 170 \r\rBack to the gates of Heaven; the sulphurous hail, \rShot after us in storm, o\'erblown hath laid \rThe fiery surge that from the precipice \rOf Heaven received us falling; and the thunder, \rWinged with red lightning and impetuous rage, \rPerhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now \rTo bellow through the vast and boundless deep. \r\r/Let us not slip the occasion,iwhether scorn \r\r*Or satiate fury yield it from our foe. \rSeest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild, 180 \r\rThe seat of desolation, void of light, \rSave what the glimmering of these livid flames \rCasts pale and dreadful?

Thammuz came next behind, \rWhose annual wound in Lebanon allured \rThe Syrian damsels to lament his fate \rIn amorous ditties all a summer\'s day, \rWhile smooth Adonis from his native rock 45 \r\rRan purple to the sea, supposed with blood \r\r\r\r\rBOOK I. 23 \r\rOf Thammuz yearly wounded : the love-tale \rInfected Sion\'s daughters with like heat, \rWhose wanton passions in the sacred porch \r\r^Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led, \r\r/ His eye surveyed the dark idolatries \r\rj Of alienated Judah. Next came one \r\r\\.,Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark \rMaimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off \rIn his own temple, on the grunsel-edge, 460 \r\rWhere he fell flat, and shamed his worshipers : \rDagon his name, sea-monster, upward man \rAnd downward fish; yet had his temple high \rReared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast \rOf Palestine, in Oath and Ascalon, \rAnd Accaron and Gaza\'s frontier bounds. \rHim followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat \rWas fair Damascus, on the fertile banks \rOf Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. \rHe also against the house of God was. bold: 470 \r\rA leper once he lost and gained a king, \rAhaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew \rGod\'s altar to disparage and displace \rFor one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn \rHis odious offerings, and adore the gods \rWhom he had vanquished. After these appeared \rA crew who, under names of old renown, \rOsiris, Isis, Orus, and their train, \rWith monstrous shapes and sorceries abused \rFanatic Egypt and her priests, to seek 480 \r\rTheir wandering gods disguised in brutish forms \rRather than human. Nor did Israel scape \rThe infection, when their borrowed gold composed \rThe calf in Oreb ; and the rebel king \r\r\r\r24 PARADISE LOST. \r\rDoubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan, \rLikening his Maker to the grazed ox \rJehovah, who, in one night, when he passed \rFrom Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke \rBoth her first-born and all her bleating gods. \rBelial came last, than whom a Spirit more lewd 490 \r\rFell not from Heaven, or more gross to love \rVice for itself. To him no temple stood \rOr altar smoked; yet who more oft than he \rIn temples and at altars, when the priest \rTurns atheist, as did Eli\'s sons, who filled \rWith lust and violence the house of God? \rIn courts and palaces he also reigns, \rAnd in luxurious cities, where the noise \rOf riot ascends above their loftiest towers, \rAnd injury and outrage; and when night 500 \r\rDarkens the streets, then wander forth the sons \rOf Belial, flown with insolence and wine. \rWitness the streets of Sodom, and that night \rIn Gibeah, when the hospitable door \rExposed a matron, to avoid worse rape. \r^ These were the prime in order and in might ; \r/*The rest were long to tell, though far renowned, \rThe Ionian gods of Javan\'s issue held \rGods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth, \rTheir boasted parents : Titan, Heaven\'s first-born, 510 \rWith his enormous brood, and birthright seized \rBy younger Saturn; he from mightier Jove, \rHis own and Rhea\'s son, like measure found ; \rSo Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete \rAnd Ida known, thence on the snowy top \rOf cold Olympus ruled the middle air, \rTheir highest Heaven ; or on the Delphian cliff, \r\r\r\rBOOK I. 25 \r\rOr in Dodona, and through all the bounds \r\rOf Doric land ; or who with Saturn old \r\rFled over Adria to the Hesperian fields, 520 \r\rAnd o\'er the Celtic roamed the utmost isles. \r\rAll these and more came flocking; but with looks \rDowncast and damp, yet such wherein appeared \rObscure some glimpse of joy, to have found their Chief \rNot in despair, to have found themselves not lost \rIn loss itself; which on his countenance cast \rLike doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride \rScxm recollecting, with jhigri words, that bora \r\rnot substancef gently raised \r\r\r\rTheir fainting courage, and dispelled their fears : 530 \r\rThen straight commands that, at the warlike sound \r\rOf trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared \r\rHis mighty standard. That proud honour claimed \r\rAzazel as his right, a Cherub tall: \r\rWho forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled \r\rThe imperial ensign, which, full high advanced, \r\rShone like a meteor streaming to the wind, \r\rWith gems and golden lustre rich emblazed, \r\rSeraphic arms and trophies ; all the while \r\rSonorous metal blowing martial sounds : 540 \r\rAt which the universal host up-sent \r\rA shout that tore Hell\'s concave, and beyond \r\rFrighted the reign of Chaos and old Night. \r\rAll in a moment through the gloom were seen \r\rTen thousand banners rise into the air, \r\rWith orient colours waving; with them rose \r\rA forest huge of spears ; and thronging helms \r\rAppeared, and serried shields in thick array \r\rOf depth immeasurable. Anon they move \r\rIn perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood 550 \r\r\r\r26 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOf flutes and soft recorders ; such as raised \rTo highth of noblest temper heroes old \rArming to battle, and instead of rage \rDeliberate valour breathed, firm and unmoved \rWith dread of death to flight or foul retreat; \rNor wanting power to mitigate and swage, \rWith solemn touches, troubled thoughts, and chase \rAnguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain \rFrom mortal or immortal minds. Thus they, \r.Breathing united force with fixed thought, 560 \r\rj fi Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed \r\\Their painful steps o\'er the burnt soil; >and now \rAdvanced in view they stand, a horrid front \rOf dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise \rOf warriors old, with ordered spear and shield, \rAwaiting what command their mighty Chief \rHad to impose. He through the armed files \rDarts his experienced eye, and soon traverse \rThe whole battalion views their order due, \rTheir visages and stature as of gods; 570 \r\rTheir number last he sums. And now his heart \rDistends with pride, and hardening in his strength \rGlories; for never, since created Man, \rMet such embodied force as, named with these, \rCould merit more than that small infantry \rWarred on by cranes : though all the giant brood \rOf Phlegra with the heroic race were joined \rThat fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side \rMixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds \rIn fable or romance of Uther\'s son, 580 \r\rBegirt with British and Armoric knights; \rAnd all who since, baptized or infidel, \rJousted in Aspramont, or Montalban, \r\r\r\rBOOK I. 27 \r\rDamasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond ; \r\rOr whom Biserta sent from Afric shore \r\rWhen Charlemain with all his peerage fell \r\rBy Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond \r\rCompare of mortal prowess, yet observed \r\rTheir dread Commander. He, above the rest \r\rIn shape and gesture proudly eminent, 590 \r\rStood like a tower; I his form had yet not lost \r\rAll her original brightness, prior appeared \r\rLess than Archangel ruined, and the excess \r\rOf glory obscured : as when the sun new-risen \r\rLooks through the horizontal misty air \r\rShorn of his beams, or from behind the moon, \r\rIn dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds \r\rOn half the nations, and with fear of change \r\rPerplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shone \r\rAbove them all the Archangel; but his face 600 \r\rDeep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care \r\rSat on his faded cheek, but under brows \r\rOf dauntless courage, .and considerate pride \r\rWaiting revenge. Cruel his eye, but cast \r\rSigns of remorse and passion, to behold \r\rThe fellows of his crime, the followers rather \r\r(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned \r\rFor ever now to have their lot in pain ; III \r\rMillions of Spirits for his fault amerced l^T.. . AJ**** :"* \r\rOf Heaven, and from eternal splendours flung 610 \r\rFor his revolt; vet faithful how r tfrev stood. \r\rTheir glory withered : as, when Heaven\'s fire \r\rHath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines, \r\rWith singed top their stately growth, though bare, \r\rStands on the blasted heath. He now prepared \r\rTo speak ; whereat their doubled ranks they bend \r\r\r\r28 PARADISE LOST. \r\rFrom wing to wing, and half enclose him round \rWith all his peers : attention held them mute. \rThrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn, \rTears, such as Angels weep, burst forth : at last 620 \r\rWords interwove with sighs found out their way : \r\r" O myriads of immortal Spirits ! O Powers \rMatchless, but with the Almighty ! and that strife \rWas not inglorious, though the event was dire, \rAs this place testifies, and this dire change, \rHateful to utter. I But what power of mind, \rForeseeing or presaging, from the depth \rOf knowledge past or present, could have feared \rHow such united force of gods, how such i \rAs stood like these, could ever know repulse? I 630 \r\rFor who can yet believe, though after loss, \rThat all these puissant legions, whose exile \rHath emptied Heaven, shall fail to re-ascend, \rSelf-raised, and re-possess their native seat? \rFor me, be witness all the host of Heaven, \rIf counsels different, or danger shunned \rBy me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns \rMonarch in Heaven, till then as one secure \rSat on his throne, upheld by old repute, \rConsent or custom, and his regal state ^ 640 \r\rPut forth at full,V^ut still his strength concealed,/ \rWhich tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. \rHenceforth his might we know, and know our own, \rSo as not either to provoke, or dread \rNew war, provoked;; our better part remains \rTo work in close design, by fraud or guile, \rWhat force effected not; that he no less \rAt length from us may find, who overcomes \rBy force hath overcome but half his foe. \r\r\r\r\\ \r\r\r\rBOOK I. 29 \r\rSpace may produce new worlds; whereof so rife 650 \r\rThere went a fame in Heaven that he ere long \r\rIntended to create, and therein plant \r\rA generation whom his choice regard \r\rShould favour equal to the Sons of Heaven. \r\rThither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps \r\rOur first eruption, thither or elsewhere; \r\rFor this infernal pit shall never hold \r\rCelestial Spirits in bondage, nor the Abyss \r\rLong under darkness cover. But these thoughts \r\rFull counsel must mature. Peace is despaired, 660 \r\rFor who can think submission? War, then, war \r\rOpen or understood, must be resolved." \r\rHe spake ; and, to confirm his words, out-flew \rMillions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs \rOf mighty Cherubim ; the sudden blaze \rFar round illumined Hell. Highly they raged \rAgainst the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms \rClashed on their sounding shields the din of war, \rHurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven. \r\rThere stood a hill not far, whose grisly top 670 \r\rBelched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire \rShone with a glossy scurf, undoubted sign \rThat in his womb was hid metallic ore, \rThe work of sulphur. Thither, winged with speed, \rA numerous brigad hastened : as when bands \rOf pioners, with spade and pickaxe armed, \rForerun the royal camp, to trench a field, \rOr cast a rampart. Mammon led them on, UJ^ \rMammon, the least erected SpTriFTEaTTell 679 \r\rFrom Heaven, for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts \rWere always downward bent, admiring more \rThe riches of Heaven\'s pavement, trodden gold, \r\r\r\r30 PARADISE LOST. \r\rThan aught divine or holy else enjoyed \r\rIn vision beatific. By him first \r\rMen also, and by his suggestion taught, \r\rRansacked the centre, and with impious hands \r\rRifled the bowels of their mother Earth \r\rFor treasures better hid. Soon had his crew \r\rOpened into the hill a spacious wound, \r\rAnd digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire 690 \r\rThat riches grow in Hell; that soil may best \r\rDeserve the precious bane. And here let those \r\rWho boast in mortal things, and wondering tell \r\rOf Babel, and the works of Memphian kings, \r\rLearn how their greatest monuments of fame, \r\rAnd strength, and art, are easily outdone \r\rBy Spirits reprobate, and in an hour \r\rWhat in an age they, with incessant toil \r\rAnd hands innumerable, scarce perform. \r\rNigh on the plain, in many cells prepared, 700 \r\rThat underneath had veins of liquid fire \r\rSluiced from the lake, a second multitude \r\rWith wondrous art founded the massy ore, \r\rSevering each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross. \r\rA third as soon had formed within the ground \r\rA various mould, and from the boiling cells \r\rBy strange conveyance filled each hollow nook : \r\rAs in an organ, from one blast of wind, \r\rTo many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes. \r\rAnon out of the earth a fabric huge 710 \r\rRose like an exhalation, with the sound \r\rOf dulcet symphonies and voices sweet, \r\rBuilt like a temple, where pilasters round \r\rWere set, and Doric pillars overlaid \r\rWith golden architrave; nor did there want \r\r\r\rBOOK I. 31 \r\rCornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven ; \r\rThe roof was fretted gold. Not Babylon, \r\rNor great Alcairo, such magnificence \r\rEqualled in all their glories, to enshrine \r\rBelus or Serapis their gods, or seat 720 \r\rTheir kings, when Egypt with Assyria strove \r\rIn wealth and luxury. The ascending pile \r\rStood fixed her stately highth, and straight the doors, \r\rOpening their brazen folds, discover, wide \r\rWithin, her ample spaces o\'er the smooth \r\rAnd level pavement: from the arched roof, \r\rPendent by subtle magic, many a row \r\rOf starry lamps and blazing cressets, fed \r\rWith naphtha and asphaltus, yielded light \r\rAs from a sky. The hasty multitude 730 \r\rAdmiring entered, and the work some praise, \r\rAnd some the architect: his hand was known \r\rIn Heaven by many a towered structure high, \r\rWhere sceptred Angels held their residence, \r\rAnd sat as princes, whom the supreme King \r\rExalted to such power, and gave to rule, \r\rEach in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright. \r\rNor was his name unheard or unadored \r\rIn ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land \r\rMen called him Mulciber; and how he fell 740 \r\rFrom Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove \r\rSheer o\'er the crystal battlements : from morn \r\rTo noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve, \r\rA summer\'s day; and with the setting sun \r\rDropt from the zenith, like a falling star, \r\rOn Lemnos, the yEgaean isle. Thus they relate, \r\rErring; for he with this rebellious rout \r\rFell long before; nor aught availed him now \r\r\r\r32 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTo have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape \r/ By all his engines, but was headlong sent 750 \r\r\\ With his industrious crew to build in Hell. \r^ Meanwhile the winged haralds, by command \rOf sovran power, with awful ceremony \rAnd trumpet\'s sound, throughout the host proclaim \rA solemn council forthwith to be held \rAt Pandemonium, the high capital \rOf Satan and his peers. Their summons called \rFrom every band and squared regiment \rBy place or choice the worthiest; they anon \rWith hundreds and with thousands trooping came 760 \rAttended. All access was thronged, the gates \rAnd porches wide, but chief the spacious hall \r(Though like a covered field, where champions bold \rWont ride in armed, and at the Soldan\'s chair \r\rr Defied the best of Panim chivalry \rTo mortal combat, or career with lance) \rThick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,^;* j \rBrushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees\\ \rIn spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, \rPour forth their populous youth about the hive 770 \r\rIn clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers \rFly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank, \rThe suburb of their straw-built citadel, \rNew rubbed with balm, expatiate and confer \r. Their state-affairs. So thick the aery crowd \r\r^ Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given, \r\rBehold a wonder ! they but now who seemed \rIn bigness to surpass Earth\'s giant sons, \rNow less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room \rThrong numberless, like that pygmean race 780 \r\rBeyond the Indian mount; or Jae.ryjslves, \r\r\r\rBOOK I. 33 \r\rWhose midnight revels, by a forest-side \r\rOr fountain, some belated peasant sees, \r\rOr dreams he sees, while overhead the moon \r\rSits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth \r\rWheels her pale course; they, on their mirth and dance \r\rIntent, with jocund music charm his ear; \r\rAt once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. \r\rThus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms \r\rReduced their shapes immense, and were at large, 790 \r\rThough without number still, amidst the hall \r\rOf that infernal court. But far within, \r\rAnd in their own dimensions like themselves, \r\rThe great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim \r\rIn close recess and secret conclave sat, \r\rA thousand demi-gods on golden seats, \r\rFrequent and full. After short silence then, \r\rAnd summons read, the great consult began. \r\r\r\rP. L. \r\r\r\rBOOK II. \r\r\r\r32 \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\rThe consultation begun, Satan debates whether another battle be to \rbe hazarded for the recovery of Heaven : some advise it, others dissuade. \rA third proposal is preferred, mentioned before by Satan, to search the \rtruth of that prophecy ortradition in Heaven concerning another-Meorld. \rand another kind of creature, equaUor^not much inferior, to them- \rje^s7ab^uT~thtsTrme to be created. Their doubt who shall be sent \ron this difficult search : Satan, their chief, undertakes alone the voyage; \ris honoured and applauded. The council thus ended, the rest betake \rthem several ways and to several employments, as their inclinations \rlead them, to entertain the time till Satan return. He passes on his \rjourney to Hell-gates, finds them shut, and who sat there to guard \rthem ; by whom at length they are opened, and discover to him the \rgreat gulf between Hell and Heaven ; with what difficulty he passes \rthrough, directed by Chaos, the Power of that place, to the sight \rof this new world which he sought. \r\r\r\rBOOK II. \r\r\r\rHIGH on a throne of royal state, which far \rOutshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind, \rOr where the gorgeous East with richest hand \rShowers on her kings barbaric pearland gold, \r\r* Satan exalted sat, by merit raised -Jf* > +&V \r\r\\To that bad eminence; and, from despair \rThus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires \rBeyond thus high, insatiate to pursue \rVain jwa with fTeave.n ; and, by success untaught, \rHis proud imaginations thus displayed : I0 \r\r" Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven ! \rFor since no deep within her gulf can hold \rImmortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen, \rI give not Heaven for lost: from this descent \rCelestial Virtues rising will appear \rMore glorious and more dread than from no fall, \rAnd trust themselves to fear no second fate. \rMe though just right, and the fixed laws of Heaven, \rDid first create your leader, next, free choice, \rWith what besides, in counsel or in fight, 20 \r\rHath been achieved of merit, yet this loss, \rThus far at least recovered, hath much more \r\r\r\r\r38 PARADISE LOST. \r\rEstablished in a safe unenvied throne, \r\rYielded with full consent. The happier state \r\rIn Heaven, which follows dignity, might draw \r\rEnvy from each inferior; but who here \r\rWill envy whom the highest place exposes \r\rForemost to stand against the Thunderer\'s aim \r\rYour bulwark, and condemns to greatest share \r\rOf endless pain? Where there is then no good \r\rFor which to strive, no strife can grow up there \r\rFrom faction; for none sure will claim in Hell \r\rPrecedence, none whose portion is so small \r\rOf present pain that with ambitious mind \r\rWill covet more. With this advantage then \r\rTo union, and firm faith, and firm accord, \r\rMore than can be in Heaven, we now return \r\rTo claim our just inheritance of old, \r\rSurer to prosper than prosperity \r\rCould have assured us; and by what best way, 40 \r\rWhether of open war or covert guile, \r\rWe now debate; who can advise may speak." \r\rHe ceased ; and next him Moloch^ sceptred king, \rStood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit \rThat fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair. \rHis trust was with the Eternal to be deemed \rEqual in strength, and rather than be less \rCared not to be at all ; with that care lost \rWent all his fear : of God, or Hell, or worse, \rHe recked not, and these words thereafter spake : 50 \r\r" My sentence is for open war : of wiles, \rMore unexpert, I boast not: them let those \rContrive who need, or when they need, not now. \rFor while they sit contriving, shall the rest, \rMillions that stand in arms, and longing wait \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 3vj \r\rThe signal to ascend, sit lingering here \rHeaven\'s fugitives, and for their dwelling-place \rAccept this dark opprobrious den of shame, \rThe prison of his tyranny who reigns \rBy our delay ? No ! let us rather choose, 60 \r\rArmed with Hell-flames and fury, all at once \rO\'er Heaven\'s high towers to force resistless way, \rTurning our tortures into horrid arms \rAgainst the Torturer; when to meet the noise \rOf his almighty engine he shall hear \rInfernal thunder, and for lightning see \rBlack fire and horror shot with equal rage \rAmong his Angels, and his throne itself \rMixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire, \rHis own invented torments. But perhaps 70 \r\rThe way seems difficult and steep to scale \rWith upright wing against a higher foe. \rLet such bethink them, if the sleepy drench \rOf that forgetful lake benumb not still, \rThat in our proper motion we ascend \rUp to our native seat; descent and fall \rTo us is adverse. Who but felt of late, \rWhen the fierce foe hung on our broken rear \rInsulting, and pursued us through the deep, \rWith what compulsion and laborious flight 80 \r\rWe sunk thus low ? The ascent is easy then ; \rThe event is feared : should we again provoke \rOur stronger, some worse way his wrath may find \rTo our destruction if there be in Hell \rFear to be worse destroyed ! What can be worse \rThan to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned \rIn this abhorred deep to utter woe; \rWhere pain of unextinguishable fire \r\r\r\r.40 PARADISE LOST. \r\rMust exercise us without hope of end, \r\rThe vassals of his anger, when the scourge 90 \r\rInexorably, and the torturing hour, \r\rCalls us to penance? More destroyed .than thus, \r\rWe should be quite abolished, and expire. \r\rWhat fear we then? what doubt we to incense \r\rHis utmost ire? which, to the highth enraged, \r\rWill either quite consume us, and reduce \r\rTo nothing this essential happier far \r\rThan miserable to have eternal being ! \r\rOr if our substance be indeed divine, \r\rAnd cannot cease to be, we are at worst 100 \r\rOn this side nothing; and by proof we feel \r\r;Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven, \r\rAnd with perpetual inroads to alarm, \r\rThough inaccessible, his fatal throne: \r\rWhich, if not victory, is yet revenge." \r\rHe ended frowning, and his look denounced \rDesperate revenge, and battle dangerous \rTo less than gods. On the other side up rose \rBelial, in act more graceful and humane ; \rA fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed no \r\rFor dignity composed, and high exploit. \rBut all was false and hollow; though his tongue \rDropt manna, and could make the worse appear \rThe better reason, to perplex and dash \rMaturest counsels : for his thoughts were low ; \rTo vice industrious, but to nobler deeds \rTimorous and slothful : yet he pleased the ear, \rAnd with persuasive accent thus began : \r\r" I should be much for open war, O Peers, \rAs not behind in hate, if what was urged 120 \r\rMain reason to persuade immediate war \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 41 \r\rDid not dissuade me most, and seem to cast \rOminous conjecture on the whole success; \rWhen he who most excels in fact of arms, \rIn what he counsels and in what excels \rMistrustful, grounds his courage on despair \rAnd utter dissolution, as the scope \rOf all his aim, after some dire revenge. \rFirst, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled \rWith armed watch, that render all access 130 \r\rImpregnable; oft on the bordering deep \rEncamp their legions, or with obscure wing \rScout far and wide into the realm of Night, \rScorning surprise. Or could we break our way \rBy force, and at our heels all Hell should rise \rWith blackest insurrection, to confound \rHeaven\'s purest light, yet our great enemy \rAll incorruptible would on his throne \rSit unpolluted, and the ethereal mould \rIncapable of stain would soon expel 140 \r\rHer mischief, and purge off the baser fire, \rVictorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope \r? Is flat despair: we must exasperate \ri f The almighty victor to spend all his rage, \rU And that must end us, that must be our cure \r< To be no more. Sad cure ! for who would lose, \rThough full of pain, this intellectual being, \rThose thoughts that wander through eternity, \rTo perish rather, swallowed up and lost \rIn the wide womb of uncreated Night, 150 \r\rDevoid of sense and motion? And who knows, \rLet this be good, whether our angry foe \rCan give it, or will ever? How he can \rIs doubtful; that he never will is sure. \r\r\r\r42 PARADISE LOST. \r\rWill he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, \rBelike through impotence, or unaware, \rTo give his enemies their wish, and end \rThem in his anger, whom his anger saves \rTo punish endless ? \' Wherefore cease we, then ? \' \rSay they who counsel war; \'we are decreed, 160 \r\rReserved, and destined to eternal woe; \rWhatever doing, what can we suffer more, \rCjVVhat can we suffer worse ? (C Is this then worst, \rThus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms? \rWhat when we fled amain, pursued and strook \rWith Heaven\'s afflicting thunder, and besought \rThe deep to shelter us? this Hell then seemed \rA refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay \rChained on the burning lake? that sure was \rWhat if the breath that kindled those grim fires, 170 \r\rAwaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage, \rAnd plunge us in the flames? or from above \rShould intermitted vengeance arm again \rHis red right hand to plague us? What if all \rHer stores were opened, and this firmament \rOf Hell should spout her cataracts of fire, \rImpendent horrors, threatening hideous fall \rOne day upon our heads ; while we perhaps, \rDesigning or exhorting glorious war, \r\rCaught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled, 180 \r\rEach on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey \rOf racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk \rUnder yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains; \rThere to converse with everlasting groans, \rUnrespited, unpitied, unreprieved, \rAges of hopeless end ! This would be worse. \rWar therefore, open or concealed, alike \r\r\r\rBOOK II. \'47 \r\rMy voice dissuades; for what can force or guile \r\rWith him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye \r\rViews all things at one view? He from Heaven\'s highth \r\rAll these our motions vain sees and derides, 191 \r\rNot more almighty to resist our might \r\rThan wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. \r\rShall we then live thus vile, the race of Heaven \r\rThus trampled, thus expelled to suffer here \r\rChains and these torments? Better these than worse, \r\rBy my advice; since fate inevitable \r\rSubdues us, and omnipotent decree, \r\rThe victor\'s will. To suffer, as to do, \r\rOur strength is equal, nor the law unjust 200 \r\rThat so ordains : this was at first resolved, \r\rIf we were wise, against so great a foe \r\rContending, and so doubtful what might fall. \r\rI laugh, when those who at the spear are bold \r\rAnd vent\'rous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear \r\rWhat yet they know must follow to endure \r\rExile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, \r\rThe sentence of their conqueror. This is now \r\rOur doom ; which if we can sustain and bear, \r\rOur supreme foe in time may much remit 210 \r\rHis anger, and perhaps, thus far removed, \r\rNot mind us not offending, satisfied \r\rWith what is punished ; whence these raging fires \r\rWill slacken, if his breath stir not their flames. \r\rOur purer essence then will overcome \r\rTheir noxious vapour, or inured not feel, \r\rOr changed at length, and to the place conformed \r\rIn temper and in nature, will receive \r\rFamiliar the fierce heat, and void of pain ; \r\rThis horror will grow mild, this darkness light; 220 \r\r\r\r4 2 PARADISE LOST. \r\r* Besides what hope the never-ending flight \rOf future days may bring, what chance, what change \rWorth waiting, since our present lot appears \rFor happy though but ill, for ill not worst, \rIf we procure not to ourselves more woe." \r\rThus Belial, with words clothed in reason\'s garb, \rCounselled ignoble ease, and peaceful sloth, \rNot peace ; and after him thus Mammon spake : \r\r"Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven \rWe war, if war be best, or to regain 230 \r\rOur own right lost : him to unthrone we then \rMay hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield \rTo fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife. \rThe former, vain to hope, argues as vain \rThe latter; for what place can be for us \rWithin Heaven\'s bound, unless Heaven\'s Lord supreme \rWe overpower? Suppose he should relent \rAnd publish grace to all, on promise made \rOf new subjection; with what eyes could we \rStand in his presence humble, and receive 240 \r\rStrict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne \rWith warbled hymns, and to his Godhead sing \rForced Halleluiahs; while he lordly sits \rOur envied sovran, and his altar breathes \r\r1 Ambrosial oduuTs~and ambrosial flowers, \rOur servile offerings? This must be our task \rIn Heaven, this our delight; how wearisome \rEternity so spent in worship paid \rTo whom we hate! Let us not then pursue, \rBy force impossible, by leave obtained 250 \r\rUnacceptable, though in Heaven, our state \rJ3f splendid vassalage ; but rather seek \rOur own good from ourselves, and from our own \r\r\r\rBOOK II. \r\rLive to ourselves, though in this vast recess, \rFree, and to none accountable, preferring \r\rTTarrl lihprfy hpforp ftp, pasy ynlcp.. \r\rOf servile pomp. Our greatness will appear \rThen most conspicuous, when great things of small, \r\\Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse, \r]We can create, and in what place soe\'er \rThrive under evil, and work ease out of pain \r^Through labour and endurance. This deep world \rOf darkness do we dread? How oft amidst \rThick clouds and dark doth Heaven\'s all-ruling Sire \rChoose to reside, his glory unobscured, \rAnd with the majesty of darkness round \rCovers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar, \rMustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell ! \rAs he our darkness, cannot we his light \rImitate when we please? This desert soil \rWants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold ; \rNor want we skill or art, from whence to raise \rMagnificence; and what can Heaven show more? \rOur torments also may in length of time \rBecome our elements, these piercing fires \rAs soft as now severe, our temper changed \rInto their temper; which must needs remove \rThe sensible of pain. All things invite \rTo peaceful counsels, and the settled state \rOf order, how in safety best we may \r[Compose our present evils, with regard \r)f what we are and where, dismissing quite \r11 thoughts of war. Ye have what I advise." \rHe scarce had finished, when such murmur filled \rle assembly, as when hollow rocks retain \rThe sound of blustering winds, which all night long \r\r\r\r-47 \r\r\r\r260 \r\r\r\r270 \r\r\r\r280 \r\r\r\r42- PARADISE LOST. \r\rHad roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull \r\rSeafaring men o\'erwatched, whose bark by chance, \r\rOr pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay \r\rAfter the tempest : such applause was heard 290 \r\rAs Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased, \r\rAdvising__peace ; for such another field \r\rTKey~dreaded worse than Hell ; so much the fear \r\rOf thunder and the sword of Michael \r\rWrought still within triem ; and no less desire \r\rToTound this Aether empire, which might rise, \r\rBy policy, and long process of time, \r\rIn emulation opposite to Heaven. \r\rWhich when Beelzebub perceived, than whom, \r\rSatan except, none higher sat, with grave 300 \r\rAspect he rose, and in his rising seemed \r\rA pillar of state ; deep on his front engraven \r\rDeliberation sat and public care; \r\rAnd princely counsel in his face yet shone, \r\rMajestic though in ruin. Sage he stood, \r\rWith Atlantean shoulders fit to bear \r\rThe weight of mightiest monarchies ; his look \r\rDrew audience and attention still as night \r\rOr summer\'s noontide air, while thus he spake: \r\r"Thrones and imperial Powers, Offspring of Heaven, \rEthereal Virtues! or these titles now 311 \r\rMust we renounce, and, changing style, be called \rPrinces of Hell? for so the popular vote \rInclines, here to continue, and build up here \rA growing empire doubtless ! while we dream, \rAnd know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed \rThis place our dungeon, not our safe retreat \rBeyond his potent arm, to live exempt \rFrom Heaven\'s high jurisdiction, in new league \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 47 \r\rBanded against his throne, but to remain 320 \r\rIn strictest bondage, though thus far removed, \rUnder the inevitable curb, reserved \rHis captive multitude. For he, be sure, \r\rI In highth or depth, still first and last will reign \rSole king, and of his kingdom lose no part \rBy our revolt, but over Hell extend \rHis empire, and with iron sceptre rule \rUs here, as with his golden those in Heaven. \rWhat sit we then projecting peace and war? \rWar hath determined us, and foiled with loss 330 \r\rIrreparable ; terms of peace yet none \rVouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given \rTo us enslaved, but custody severe, \rAnd stripes, and arbitrary punishment \rInflicted? and what peace can we return, \rBut, to our power, hostility and hate, \rUntamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow, \rYet ever plotting how the conqueror least \rMay reap his conquest, and may least rejoice \rIn doing what we most in suffering feel ? 340 \r\rNor will occasion want, nor shall we need \rWith dangerous expedition to invade \rHeaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege, \rOr ambush from the deep. What if we find \rSome easier enterprise? There is a place \r(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven \rErr not), another world, the happy seat \rOf some new race called Man, about this time \rTo be created like to us, though less \r\'In power and excellence, but favoured more 350 \r\rOf him who rules above; so was his will \rPronounced among the gods, and by an oath, \r\r\r\r48 PARADISE LOST. \r\r, That shook Heaven\'s whole circumference, confirmed. \r\rThither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn \rj What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, \rj Or substance, how endued, and what their power, \r1 And where their weakness, how attempted best, \r\rBy force or subtlety. Though Heaven be shut, \r\rAnd Heaven\'s high Arbitrator sit secure \r\rIn his own strength, this place may lie exposed, 360 \r\rThe utmost border of his kingdom, left \r\rTo their defence who hold it; here, perhaps, \r\rSome advantageous act may be achieved \r\rBy sudden onset : either with Hell-fire \r\rTo waste his whole creation, or possess \r? All as our own, and drive, as we are driven, \r\r{The puny habitants ; or if not drive, \rSeduce them to our party, that their God \rMay prove their foe, and with repenting hand \rAbolish his own works. This would surpass 370 \r\rCommon revenge, and interrupt his joy \rIn our confusion, and our joy upraise \rIn his disturbance; when his darling sons, \rHurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse \rTheir frail original, and faded bliss, \r\r, Faded so soon ! Advise if this be worth \r\r: Attempting, or to sit in darkness here \r\ri, Hatching vain empires." Thus Beelzebub \rPleaded his devilish counsel, first devised \rBy Satan, and in part proposed; for whence, 380 \r\rBut from the author of all ill, could spring \rSo deep a malice, to confound the race \rOf Mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell \rTo mingle and involve, done all to spite \rThe great Creator? But their spite still serves \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 49 \r\rHis glory to augment. The bold design \rPleased highly those infernal States, and joy \rSparkled in all their eyes; with full assent \rThey vote : whereat his speech he thus renews : \r\r"Well have ye judged, well ended long debate, 390 \rSynod of gods, and, like to what ye are, \rGreat things resolved; which from the lowest deep \rWill once more lift us up, in spite of fate, \rNearer our ancient seat; perhaps in view \rOf those bright confines, whence, with neighbouring arms \rAnd opportune excursion, we may chance \rRe-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone \rDwell not unvisited of Heaven\'s fair light, \rSecure, and at the brightening orient beam \rPurge off this gloom ; the soft delicious air, 400 \r\rTo heal the scar of these corrosive fires, \rShall breathe her balm. But first, whom shall we send \rIn search of this new world? whom shall we find \rSufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet \rThe dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss, \rAnd through the palpable obscure find out \rHis uncouth way, or spread his aery flight, \rUpborne with indefatigable wings \rOver the vast abrupt, ere he arrive \r\rThe happy isle? What strength, what art, can then 410 \rSuffice, or what evasion bear him safe \rThrough the strict senteries and stations thick \rOf Angels watching round? Here he had need \rAll circumspection, and we now no less \rChoice in our suffrage; for on whom we send \rThe weight of all, and our last hope, relies." \r\rThis said, he sat ; and expectation held \rHis look suspense, awaiting who appeared \r\rp. L. 4 \r\r\r\r50 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTo second, or oppose, or undertake \r\rt The perilous attempt ; but all sat mute, 420 \r\rj Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each \r\rI In other\'s countenance read his own dismay, \rAstonished. None among the choice and prime \rOf those Heaven-warring champions could be found \rSo hardy as to proffer or accept, \rAlone, the dreadful voyage; till at last \rSatan, whom now transcendent glory raised \rAbove his fellows, with monarchal pride \rConscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake: \r\r" O Progeny of Heaven, empyreal Thrones ! 430 \r\rWith reason hath deep silence and demur \rSeized us, though undismayed. Long is the way \rAnd hard, that out of Hell leads up to light; \r\rj Our prison strong, this huge convex of fire, \r\rj Outrageous to devour, immures us round \r\r1 Ninefold, and gates of burning adamant, \r\r1 Barred over us, prohibit all egress. \rThese passed, if any pass, the void profound \rrO Of unessential Night receives him next, \r\rWide-gaping, and with utter loss of being 440 \r\rThreatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf. \r\rIf thence he scape into whatever world, \r\rOr unknown region, what remains him less \r\rThan unknown dangers and as hard escape? \r\rBut I should ill become this throne, O Peers, \r\rAnd this imperial sovranty, adorned \r\rWith splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed \r\rAnd judged of public moment, in the shape \r\rOf difficulty or danger, could deter \r\rMe from attempting. Wherefore do I assume 450 \r\rThese royalties, and not refuse to reign, \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 51 \r\rRefusing to accept as great a share \rOf hazard as of honour, due alike \rTo him who reigns, and so much to him due \rOf hazard more, as he above the rest \rHigh honoured sits? Go therefore, mighty Powers, \rTerror of Heaven, though fallen ; intend at home, \rWhile here shall be our home, what best may ease \rThe present misery, andjender Hell \rMore tolerable ; if there be cure or charm 460 \r\r^To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain \r(Of this ill mansion; intermit no watch \r\\Against a wakeful foe, while I abroad \rThrough all the coasts of dark destruction seek \rDeliverance for us all : this enterprise \rNone shall partake with me." Thus saying, rose \rThe Monarch, and prevented all reply ; \rpmHpntj lest, from his resolution raised, \rOthers among the chief might offer now \r(Certain to be refused) what erst they feared, 470 \r\rAnd, so refused, might .in opinion stand \rHis rivals, winning cheap^ the high_ipute \riVhich he through^ hazard huge must earn. But they \rDreaded not inore the adventure than his voice \rForbidding ; and at once with him they rose ; \rTheir rising all at once was as the sound \rOf thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend \rWith awful reverence prone; and as a god \rhim equal to the Highest in Heaven. \rNor failed they to express how much they praised 480 \rThat for the general safety he despised \rHis own; for neither do the Spirits damned \rLose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast \rTheir specious deeds on Earth, which glory excites, \r\r42 \r\r\r\rVE \r\r\r\r52 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOr close ambition varnished o\'er with zeal. \r\rThus they their doubtful consultations dark \rEnded, rejoicing in their matchless Chief: \rAs when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds \rAscending, while the North-wind sleeps, o\'erspread \rHeaven\'s cheerful face, the louring element 490 \r\rScowls o\'er the darkened landskip snow or shower; \rIf chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet \rExtend his evening beam, the fields revive, \rThe birds their notes renew, and bleating herds \rAttest their joy, that hill and valley rings. \rO shame to men ! Devil with devil damned \rFirm concord holds, men only disagree \rOf creatures rational, though under hope \rOf heavenly grace ; and, God proclaiming peace, \rYet live in hatred, enmity, and strife 500 \r\rAmong themselves, and levy cruel wars, \rWasting the Earth, each other to destroy: \rAs if (which might induce us to accord) \rMan had not hellish foes enow besides, \rThat day and night for his destruction wait ! \r\rThe Stygian council thus dissolved ; and forth \rIn order came the grand infernal Peers; \rMidst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed \rAlone the antagonist of Heaven, nor less \rThan Hell\'s dread Emperor, with pomp supreme, 510 \rAnd god-like imitated state; him round \rA globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed \rWith bright emblazonry, and horrent arms. \rThen of their session ended they bid cry \rWith trumpet\'s regal sound the great result: \rToward the four winds four speedy Cherubim \rPut to their mouths the sounding alchymy, \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 53 \r\rBy harald\'s voice explained; the hollow Abyss \r\rHeard far and wide, and all the host of Hell \r\rWith deafening shout returned them loud acclaim. 520 \r\rThence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised \r\rBy false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers \r\rDisband ; and, wandering, each his several way \r\rPursues, as inclination or sad choice \r\rLeads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find \r\rTruce to his restless thoughts, and entertain \r\rThe irksome hours, till his great Chief return. \r\rPart on the plain, or in the air sublime, \r\rUpon the wing or in swift race contend, \r\rAs at the Olympian games or Pyjhian fields ; 530 \r\rPart curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal \r\rWith rapid wheels, or fronted brigads form : \r\rAs when, to warn proud cities, war appears \r\rWaged in the troubled sky, and armies rush \r\rTo battle in the clouds; before each van \r\rPrick forth the aery knights, and couch their spears, \r\rTill thickest legions close ; with feats of arms \r\rFrom either end of Heaven the welkin burns. \r\rOthers, with vast Typhoean rage more fell, \r\rRend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air 540 \r\rIn whirlwind ; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar : \r\rAs when Alcides, from GEchalia crowned \r\rWith conquest, felt the envenomed robe, and tore \r\rThrough pain up by the roots Thessalian pines, \r\rAnd Lichas from the top of (Eta threw \r\rInto the Euboic sea. Others more mild, \r\rRetreated in a silent valley, sing \r\rWith notes angelical to many a harp \r\rTheir own heroic deeds and hapless fall \r\rBy doom of battle; and complain that Fate 550 \r\r\r\r54 PARADISE LOST. \r\rFree Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance. \r\rTheir song was partial, but the harmony \r\r(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) \r\rSuspended Hell, and took with ravishment \r\rThe thronging audience. In discourse more sweet \r\r(For eloquence the soul, song charms the sense) \r\rOthers apart sat on a hill retired, \r\rIn thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high \r\rOf providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate, \r\rFixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, 560 \r\rAnd found no end, in wandering mazes lost. \r\rOf good and evil much they argued then, \r\rOf happiness and final misery, \r\rPassion and apathy, and glory and shame, \r\rVain wisdom all, and false philosophy ! \r\rYet with a pleasing sorcery could charm \r\rPain for a while or anguish, and excite \r\rFallacious hope, or arm the obdured breast \r\rWith stubborn patience as with triple steel. \r\rAnother part, in squadrons and gross bands, 570 \r\rOn bold adventure to discover wide \r\rThat dismal world, if any clime perhaps \r\rMight yield them easier habitation, bend \r\rFour ways their flying march, along the banks \r\rOf four infernal rivers that disgorge \r\rInto the burning lake their baleful streams: \r\rAbhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate; \r\rSad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; \r\rCocytus, named of lamentation loud \r\rHeard on the rueful stream ; fierce Phlegethon, 580 \r\rWhose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. \r\rFar off from these a slow and silent stream, \r\rLethe, the river of oblivion, rolls \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 55 \r\rHer watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks \r\rForthwith his former state and being forgets, \r\rForgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. \r\rBeyond this flood a frozen continent \r\rLies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms \r\rOf whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land \r\rThaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems 590 \r\rOf ancient pile ; all else deep snow and ice, \r\rA gulf profound as that Serbonian bog \r\rBetwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old, \r\rWhere armies whole have sunk : the parching air \r\rBurns frore, and cold performs the effect of fire. \r\rThither, by harpy-footed Furies haled, \r\rAt certain revolutions all the damned \r\rAre brought; and feel by turns the bitter change \r\rOf fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce, \r\rFrom beds of raging fire to starve in ice 600 \r\rTheir soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine \r\rImmovable, infixed, and frozen round \r\rPeriods of time ; thence hurried back to fire. \r\rThey ferry over this Lethean sound \r\rBoth to and fro, their sorrow to augment, \r\rAnd wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach \r\rThe tempting stream, with one small drop to lose \r\rIn sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, \r\rAll in one moment, and so near the brink ; \r\rBut Fate withstands, and, to oppose the attempt, 610 \r\rMedusa with Gorgonian terror guards \r\rThe ford, and of itself the water flies \r\rAll taste of living wight, as once it fled \r\rThe lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on \r\rIn confused march forlorn, the adventrous bands, \r\rWith shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast, \r\r\r\r56 PARADISE LOST. \r\rViewed first their lamentable lot, and found \r\rNo rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale \r\rThey passed, and many a region dolorous, \r\rO\'er many a frozen, many a fiery Alp, 620 \r\rRocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death, \r\rA universe of death, which God by curse \r\rCreated evil, for evil only good, \r\rWhere all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds, \r\rPerverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, \r\rAbominable, inutterable, and worse \r\rThan fables yet have feigned, or fear conceived, \r\rGorgons, and Hydras, and Chimseras dire. \r\rMeanwhile the Adversary of God and Man, \rSatan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design, 630 \r\rPuts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell \rExplores his solitary flight; sometimes \rHe scours the right\'Tiand coast, sometimes the left; \rNow shaves with level wing the deep, then soars \rUp to the fiery concave towering high. \rAs when far off at sea a fleet descried \rHangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds \rClose sailing from Bengala, or the isles \rOf Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring \rTheir spicy drugs; they on the trading flood, 640 \r\rThrough the wide Ethiopian to the Cape, \rPly stemming nightly toward the pole : so seemed \rFar off the flying Fiend. At last appear \rHell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof, \rAnd thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass, \rThree iron, three of adamantine rock, \rImpenetrable, impaled with circling fire, \rYet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat \rOn either side a formidable Shape. \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 57 \r\rThe one seemed woman to the waist, and fair, 650 \r\rI But ended foul in many a scaly fold \r1 Voluminous and vast, a serpent armed \r\\With mortal sting. About her middle round \r^. cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked \rWith wide Cerbergan mouths full loud, and rung \rA hideous peal ; yet, when they list, would creep, \rIf aught disturbed their noise, into her womb, \rAnd kennel there, yet there still barked and howled \rWithin unseen. Far less abhorred than these \rVexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts 660 \r\rCalabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore; \rNor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called \rIn secret, riding through the air she comes, \rLured with the smell of infant blood, to dance \rWith Lapland witches, while the labouring moon \rEclipses at their charms. The other Shape \rIf shape it might be called that shape had none \rDistinguishable in member, joint, or limb; \rOr substance might be called that shadow seemed, \rFor each seemed either black it stood as Night, 670 \rFierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, \rAnd shook a dreadful dart; what seemed his head \rThe likeness of a kingly crown had on. \rSatan was now at hand, and from his seat \rThe monster moving onward came as fast, \rWith horrid strides ; Hell trembled as he strode. \rThe undaunted Fiend what this might be admired, K\'OK \rAdmired, not feared God and his Son except, \rCreated thing naught valued he nor shunned \rAnd with disdainful look thus first began : 6So \r\r"Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape, \rThat dar\'st, though grim and terrible, advance \r\r\r\r| \r\r\r\r58 PARADISE LOST. \r\rThy miscreated front athwart my way \rTo yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass, \rThat be assured, without leave asked of thee. \rRetire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, \rHell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven." \r\rTo whom the Goblin, full of wrath, replied : \r"Art thou that Traitor- Angel, art thou he, \rj Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith, till then 690 \r, Unbroken, and in proud rebellious arms \r! Drew after him the third part of Heaven\'s sons, \r\\_ Conjured against the Highest, for which both thou \rAnd they, outcast from God, are here condemned \rTo waste eternal days in woe and pain? \rAnd reckon\'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven, \rHell-doomed, and breath\'st defiance here and scorn, \rWhere I reign king, and, to enrage thee more, \rThy king and lord? Back to thy punishment, \rFalse fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, 700 \r\rLest with a whip of scorpions I pursue \rThy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart \rStrange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before." \r\rSo spake the grisly Terror, and in shape, \rSo speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold \rMore dreadful and deform. On the other side, \rIncensed with indignation, Satan stood \rUnterrified, and like a comet burned, \rThat fires the length of Ophiuchus huge \rIn the arctic sky, and from Els horrid hair 710 \r\rShakes pestilence and war. Each at the head \rLevelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands \rNo second stroke intend ; and such a frown \rEach cast at the other, as when two black clouds, \rWith Heaven\'s artillery fraught, come rattling on \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 59 \r\rOver tiie Caspian, then stand front to front \r\rHovering a space, till winds the signal blow \r\rTo join their dark encounter in mid-air : \r\rSo frowned the mighty combatants, that Hell \r\rGrew darker at their frown; so matched they stood; 720 \r\rFor never but once more was either like \r\rTo meet so great a foe. And now great deeds \r\rHad been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung, \r\rHad not the snaky Sorceress, that sat \r\rFast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key, \r\rRisen, and with hideous outcry rushed between. \r\r"O father, what intends thy hand," she cried, \r"Against thy only son? What fury, O son, \rPossesses thee to bend that mortal dart \rAgainst thy father\'s head? and know\'st for whom; 730 \rFor him who sits above, and laughs the while \rAt thee ordained his drudge, to execute \rWhate\'er his wrath, which he calls justice, bids \rHis wrath, which one day will destroy ye both ! " \r\rShe spake, and at her words the hellish Pest \rForbore; then these to her Satan returned: \r\r"So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange \rThou interposest, that my sudden hand, \rPrevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds \rWhat it intends, till first I know of thee 740 \r\rWhat thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why, \rIn this infernal vale first met, thou call\'st \rMe father, and that phantasm call\'st my son. \rI know thee not, nor ever saw till now \rSight more detestable than him and thee." \r\rTo whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied: \r" Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem \rNow in thine eye so foul? once deemed so fair \r\r\r\r60 PARADISE LOST. \r\r1 In .rleaven, when at the assembly, and in sight \r^)f all the Seraphim with thee combined 750 \r\rI In bold conspiracy against Heaven\'s King, \rAll on a sudden miserable pain \rSurprised thee; dim thine eyes, and dizzy swum \rIn darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast \rThrew forth, till on the left side opening wide, \rLikest to thee in shape and countenance bright, \rThen shining Heavenly-fair, a goddess armed, \rOut of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized \rAll the host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid \rAt first, and called me Sin^ and for a sign 760 \r\rPortentous held me; but, familiar grown, \rI pleased, and with attractive graces won \rThe most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft \rThyself in me thy perfect image viewing \rBecam\'st enamoured; and such joy thou took\'st \rWith me in secret, that my womb conceived \rA growing burden. Meanwhile war arose, \rAnd fields were fought in Heaven ; wherein remained \r(For what could else?) to our almighty foe \rClear victory, to our part loss and rout 770 \r\rThrough all the Empyrean. Down they fell, \rDriven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down \rInto this deep, and in the general fall \rI also; at which time this powerful key \rInto my hands was given, with charge to keep \rThese gates for ever shut, which none can pass \rWithout my opening. Pensive here I sat \rAlone; but long I sat not, till my womb, \rPregnant by thee, and now excessive grown, \rProdigious motion felt and rueful throes. 780 \r\rAt last this odious offspring whom thou seest, \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 6 1 \r\rThine own begotten, breaking violent way, \r\rTore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain \r\rDistorted, all my nether shape thus grew \r\rTransformetl ; but he, my inbred enemy, \r\rForth issued, brandishing his fatal dart, \r\rMade to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death! \r\rHell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed \r\rFrom all her caves, and back resounded Death ! \r\rI fled ; but he pursued (though more, it seems, 790 \r\rInflamed with lust than rage) and, swifter far, \r\rMe overtook, his mother, all dismayed, \r\rAnd, in embraces forcible and foul \r\rEngendering with me, of that rape begot \r\rThese yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry \r\rSurround me, as thou saw\'st, hourly conceived \r\rAnd hourly born, with sorrow infinite \r\rTo me; for, when they list, into the womb \r\rThat bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw \r\rMy bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth 800 \r\rAfresh, with conscious terrors vex me round, \r\rThat rest or intermission none I find. \r\rBefore mine eyes in opposition sits \r\rGrim Death, my son and foe, who sets them on, \r\rAnd me, his parent, would full soon devour \r\rFor want of other prey, but that he knows \r\rHis end with mine involved, and knows that I \r\rShould prove a bitter morsel, and his bane, \r\rWhenever that shall be ; so Fate pronounced. \r\rBut thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun 810 \r\rHis deadly arrow ; neither vainly hope \r\rTcTbe invulnerable in those bright arms, \r\rThough tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint, \r\rSave he who reigns above, none can resist." \r\r\r\r\r62 PARADISE LOST. \r\rShe finished ; and the subtle Fiend his lore \rSoon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth: \r\r"Dear daughter since thou claim\'st me for thy sire, \rAnd my jajr son here show\'st me, the dear pledge \rOf dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys \rThen sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change 820 \rBefallen us unforeseen, unthought of know, \rI come no enemy, but to set free \rFrom out this dark and dismal house of pain \rBoth him and thee, and all the Heavenly host \rOf Spirits that, in our just pretences armed, \rFell with us from on high. From them I go \rThis uncouth errand sole, and one for all \rMyself expose, with lonely steps to tread \rThe unfounded deep, and through the void immense \rTo search with wandering quest a place foretold 830 \r\rShould be, and, by concurring signs, ere now \rCreated vast and round, a place of bliss \rIn the purlieus of Heaven, and therein placed \rA race of upstart creatures, to supply \rPerhaps our vacant room, though more removed, \rLest Heaven, surcharged with potent multitude, \rMight hap to move new broils. Be this, or aught \rThan this more secret, now designed, I haste \rTo know; and, this once known, shall soon return, \rAnd bring ye to the place where thou and Death 840 \rShall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen \rWing silently the buxom air, embalmed \rWith odours : there ye shall be fed and filled \rImmeasurably; all things shall be your prey." \r\rHe ceased, for both seemed highly pleased, and Death \rGrinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear \rHis famine should be filled, and blessed his maw \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 63 \r\rDestined to that good hour. No less rejoiced \rHis mother bad, and thus bespake her sire : \r\r"The key of this infernal pit, by due 850 \r\rAnd by command of Heaven\'s all-powerful King, \rI keep, by him forbidden to unlock \rThese adamantine gates; against all force \rDeath ready stands to interpose his dart, \rFearless to be o\'ermatched by living might. \rBut what owe I to his commands above, \rWho hates me, and hath hither thrust me down \rInto this gloom of Tartarus profound, \rTo sit in hateful office here confined, \rInhabitant of Heaven and Heavenly-born, 860 \r\rHere in perpetual agony and pain, \rWith terrors and with clamours compassed round \rOf mine own brood, that on my bowels feed? \rThou art my father, thou my author, thou \rMy being gav\'st me; whom should I obey \rBut thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon \rTo that new world of .light and bliss, among \rThe gods who live at ease, where I shall reign \rAt thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems \rThy daughter and thy darling, without end." 870 \r\rThus saying, from her side the fatal key, \rSfad instrument of all our woe, she took; \rAnd, towards the gate rolling her bestial train, \rForthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew, \rWhich but herself not all the StygiajL-Powers \rCould once have moved; then in the key-hole turns \rThe intricate wards, and every bolt and bar \rOf massy iron or solid rock with ease \rUnfastens : on a sudden open fly, \rWith impetuous recoil and jarring sound, 880 \r\r\r\r64 PARADISE LOST. \r\rThe infernal doors, and on their hinges grate \rHarsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook \rOf Erebus. She opened, but to shut \rExcelled her power; the gates wide open stood, \rThat with extended wings a bannered host, \rUnder spread ensigns marching, might pass through \rWith horse and chariots ranked in loose array; \rSo wide they stood, and like a furnace-mouth \rCast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame. \r\rf\\ Before their eyes in sudden view appear 890 \r\r( The secrets of the hoary deep, a dark \r* \\ Illimitable ocean, without bound, \r\r\\ Without dimension; where length, breadth, and highth, \r\rI And time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night \r\r/ And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold \rEternal anarchy, amidst the noise \rOf endless wars, and by confusion stand. \rFor Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce, \rStrive here for mastery, and to battle bring \rTheir embryon atoms; they around the flag 900 \r\rOf each his faction, in their several clans, \rLight-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow, \rSwarm populous, unnumbered as the sands \rOf Barca or Gyrene\'s torrid soil, \rLevied to side with warring winds, and poise \rTheir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere \rHe rules a moment; Qiaos umpire sits, \rAnd by decision more emEroils the fray \rBy which he reigns; next him, high arbiter, \rCJiance governs all. Into this wild Abyss, 910 \r\rThe womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave, \rOf neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire, \rBut all these in their pregnant causes mixed \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 65 \r\rConfusedly, and which thus must ever fight, \r\rUnless the Almighty Maker them ordain \r\rHis dark materials to create more worlds \r\rInto this wild Abyss the wary Fiend \r\rStood on the brink of Hell and looked a while, \r\rPondering his voyage; for no narrow frith \r\rHe had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed 920 \r\rWith noises loud and ruinous (to compare \r\rGreat things with small) than when Bellona storms, \r\rWith all her battering engines bent tcTrase"" \r\rSome capital city; or less than if this frame \r\rOf Heaven were falling, and these elements \r\rIn mutiny had from her axle torn \r\rThe steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans \r\rHe spreads for flight, and in the surging smoke \r\rUplifted spurns the ground; thence many a league, \r\rAs in a cloudy chair, ascending rides 930 \r\rAudacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets \r\rA vast vacuity : all unawares, \r\rFluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops \r\rTen thousand fathom deep, and to this hour \r\rDown had been falling, had not by ill chance \r\rThe strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud, \r\rInstinct with fire and nitre, hurried him \r\rAs many miles aloft ; that fury stayed \r\rQuenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea, \r\rNor. good dry land nigh foundered, on he fares, 940 \r\rTreading the crude consistence, half on foot, \r\rHalf flying; behoves him now both oar and sail. \r\rAs when a gryphon through the wilderness \r\rWith winged course, o\'er hill or moory dale, p \r\rPursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth \r\rHad from his wakeful custody purloined \r\rp. L. c \r\r\r\r66 PARADISE LOST. \r\rThe guarded gold : so eagerly the Fiend \r\rO\'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, \r\rWith head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way, \r\rAnd swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies. 950 \r\rAt length a universal hubbub wild \r\rOf stunning sounds and voices all confused, \r\rBorne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear \r\rWith loudest vehemence. Thither he plies \r\rUndaunted, to meet there whatever Power \r\rOr Spirit of the nethermost Abyss \r\rMight in that noise reside, of whom to ask \r\rWhich way the nearest coast of darkness lies \r\rBordering on light; when straight behold the throne \r\rOf Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread 960 \r\rWide on the wasteful Deep! With him enthroned \r\rSat sable-vested Night, eldest of things, \r\rThe consort of his reign ; and by them stood \r\rOrcus and Ades, and the dreaded name \r\rOf Demogorgon; Rumour next and Chance, \r\rAnd Tumult and Confusion all embroiled, \r\rAnd Discord with a thousand various mouths. \r\rTo whom Satan, turning boldly, thus : " Ye Powers \rAnd Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, \rChaos and ancient Night, I come no spy, 970 \r\rWith purpose to explore or to disturb \rThe secrets of your realm ; but, by constraint \rWandering this darksome desert, as my way \rLies through your spacious empire up to light, \rAlone and without guide, half lost, I seek, \rWhat readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds \rConfine with Heaven ; or if some other place, \rFrom your dominion won, the Ethereal King \rPossesses lately, thither to arrive \r\r\r\rBOOK II. \r\r\r\r6 7 \r\r\r\rI travel this profound. Direct my course : 980 \r\rDirected, no mean recompense it brings \r\rTo your behoof, if I that region lost, \r\rAll usurpation thence expelled, reduce \r\rTo her original darkness and your sway \r\r(Which is my present journey), and once more \r\rErect the standard there of ancient Night \r\rYours be the advantage all, mine the revenge !" \r\rThus Satan ; and him thus the Anarch old, \rWith faltering speech and visage incomposed, \rAnswered: "I know thee, stranger, who thou art, 990 \rThat mighty leading Angel, who of late \rMade head against Heaven\'s King, though overthrown. \rI saw and heard ; for such a numerous host \rFled not in silence through the frighted deep, \rWith ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, \rConfusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates \rPoured out by millions her victorious bands, \rPursuing. I upon my frontiers here \rKeep residence ; if all I can will serve \rThat little which is left so to defend, 1000 \r\rEncroached on still through our intestine broils \rWeakening the sceptre of old Night : first Hell, \rYour dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath; \rNow lately Heaven and Earth, another world \rHung o\'er my realm, linked in a golden chain \rTo that side Heaven from whence your legions fell. \rIf that way be your walk, you have not far; \rSo much the nearer danger. Go, and speed! \rHavoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain." \r\rHe ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply, 1010 \r\rBut, glad that now his sea should find a shore, \rWith fresh alacrity and force renewed \r\r52 \r\r\r\r68 PARADISE LOST. \r\rSprings upward, like a pyramid of fire, \r\rInto the wild expanse, and through the shock \r\rOf fighting elements, on all sides round \r\rEnvironed, wins his way; harder beset \r\rAnd more endangered, than when Argo passed \r\rThrough Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks; \r\rOr when Ulysses on the larboard shunned \r\rCharybdis, and by the other whirlpool steered : 1020 \r\rSo he with difficulty and labour hard \r\rMoved on : with difficulty and labour he ; \r\rBut, he once passed, soon after, when Man fell, \r\rStrange alteration ! Sin and Death amain, \r\rFollowing his track (such was the will of Heaven) \r\rPaved after him a broad and beaten way \r\rOver the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf \r\rTamely endured a bridge of wondrous length, \r\rFrom Hell continued, reaching the utmost orb \r\rOf this frail world; by which the Spirits perverse 1030 \r\rWith easy intercourse pass to and fro \r\rTo tempt or punish mortals, except whom \r\rGod and good Angels guard by special grace. \r\rBut now at last the sacred influence \rOf light appears, and from the walls of Heaven \rShoots far into the bosom of dim Night \rA glimmering dawn. Here Nature first begins \rHer farthest verge, and Chaos to retire, \rAs from her outmost works, a broken foe, \rWith tumult less and with less hostile din ; 1040 \r\rThat Satan with less toil, and now with ease, \rWafts on the calmer wave by dubious light, \rAnd, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds \rGladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; \rOr in the emptier waste, resembling air, \r\r\r\rBOOK II. 69 \r\rWeighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold \r\rFar off the empyreal Heaven, extended wide \r\rIn circuit, undetermined square or round, \r\rWith opal towers and battlements adorned \r\rOf living sapphire, once his native seat; 1050 \r\rAnd fast by, hanging in a golden chain, \r\rThis pendent world, in bigness as a star \r\rOf smallest magnitude close by the moon. \r\rThither, full fraught with mischievous revenge, \r\rAccurst, and in a cursed hour, he hies. \r\r\r\rBOOK III. \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\rGod, sitting on his throne, sees Satan flying towards this World, \rthen newly created; shows him to the Son, who sat at his right hand; \rforetells the success of Satan in perverting mankind; clears his own \rjustice and wisdom from all imputation, having created Man free, and \rable enough to have withstood his Tempter; yet declares his purpose of \rgrace towards him, in regard he fell not of his own malice, as did \rSatan, but by him seduced. The Son of God renders praises to his \rFather for the manifestation of his gracious purpose towards Man ; but \rGod again declares that grace cannot be extended towards Man without \rthe satisfaction of Divine Justice : Man hath offended the majesty of \rGod by aspiring to Godhead, and therefore, with all his progeny, \rdevoted to death, must die, unless some one can be found sufficient to \ranswer for his offence, and undergo his punishment. The Son of God \rfreely offers himself a ransom for Man : the Father accepts him, ordains \rhis incarnation, pronounces his exaltation above all names in Heaven and \rEarth ; commands all the Angels to adore him : they obey, and, hymning \rto their harps in full quire, celebrate the Father and the Son. Mean- \rwhile Satan alights upon the bare convex of this World\'s outermost \rorb; where wandering he first finds a place since called the Limbo of \rVanity; what persons and things fly up thither: thence comes to the \rgate of Heaven, described ascending by stairs, and the waters above the \rfirmament that flow about it. His passage thence to the orb of the \rSun: he finds there Uriel, the regent of that orb, but first changes \rhimself into the shape of a meaner Angel, and pretending a zealous \rdesire to behold the new Creation, and Man whom God had placed \rhere, inquires of him the place of his habitation, and is directed : alights \rfirst on Mount Niphates. \r\r\r\rBOOK III. \r\rHAIL, holy Light, offspring of Heaven first-born! \rOr of the Eternal coeternal beam \rMay I express thee unblamed? since God is light, \rAnd never but in unapproached light \rDwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee, \rBright effluence of bright essence increate! \rOr hear\'st thou rather pure Ethereal stream, \rWhose fountain who shall tell? Before the sun, \rBefore the Heavens, thou wert, and at the voice \rOf God, as with a mantle, didst invest 10 \r\rThe rising World of waters dark and deep, \rWon from the void and formless infinite! \rThee I revisit now with bolder wing, \rEscagedLlhe.-. Stygian pool, though long detained \rIn that obscure sojourn, while in my flight, \rThrough utter and through middle darkness borne, \rWith other notes than to the Orphean lyre \rI sung of Chaos and eternal Night; \rTaught by trie Heavenly Muse to venture down \rThe dark descent, and up to re-ascend, 20 \r\rThough hard and rare : thee I revisit safe, \rAnd feel thy sovran vital lamp ; but thou \r\r\r\r74 PARADISE LOST. \r\rRevisit\'st not these eyes, that roll in vain \r\rTo find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; \r\rSo thick a drop serene hath quenched their orbs, \r\rOr dim suffusion veiled. Yet not the more \r\rCease I to wander where the Muses haunt \r\rClear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill, \r\rSmit with the love of sacred song; but chief \r\rThee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath, 30 \r\rThat wash thy hallowed feet, and warbling flow, \r\rNightly I visit; nor sometimes forget \r\rThose other two equalled with me in fate, \r\rSo were I equalled with them in renown, \r\rBlind Thamyris and blind Masonides, \r\rAnd Tiresias and Phmeus T prophets old: \r\rThen feed on thoughts that voluntary move \r\rHarmonious numbers ; as the wakeful bird \r\rSings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid \r\rTunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year 40 \r\rSeasons return; but not to me returns \r\rDay, or the sweet approach of even or morn, \r\rOr sight of vernal bloom, or summer\'s rose, \r\rOr flocks, or herds, or human face divine; \r\rBut cloud instead and ever-during dark \r\rSurrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men \r\rCut off, and, for the book of knowledge fair, \r\rPresented with a universal blank \r\rOf Nature\'s works, to me expunged and rased, \r\rAnd wisdom at one entrance quite shut out. 50 \r\rSo much the rather thou, celestial Light, \r\rShine inward, and the mind through all her powers \r\rIrradiate : there plant eyes, all mist from thence \r\rPurge and disperse, that I may see and tell \r\rOf things invisible to mortal sight. \r\r\r\rBOOK III. 75 \r\rNow had the Almighty Father from above, \rFrom the pure Empyrean where he sits \rHigh throned above all highth, bent down his eye, \rHis own works and their works at once to view : \rAbout him all the Sanctities of Heaven 60 \r\rStood thick as stars, and from his sight received \rBeatitude past utterance; on his right \rTheradiantiiTiage of his ^glory-sat, \rHis only Son. On Earth he first beheld \rOur two first \'parents, yet the only two \rOf mankind, in the Happy Garden placed, \rReaping immortal fruits of joy and love, \rUninterrupted joy, unrivalled love, \rIn blissful solitude. He then surveyed \rHell and the gulf between, and Satan there, 70 \r\rCoasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night \rIn the dun air sublime, and ready now \rTo stoop with wearied wings and willing feet \rOn the bare outside of this World, that seemed \rFirm land imbosomed without firmament, \rUncertain which, in ocean or in air. \rHim God beholding from his prospect high, \rWherein past, present, future, he beholds, \rThus to his only Son foreseeing spake: \r\r" Onlyj-begotten Son, seest thou what rage 80 \r\rfljr Af1vprc;gry_?_wjinm ru \r\r\r\rPrescribed, no bars of Hell, nor all the chains \r\' Heaped on him there, nor yet the main Abyss \r| Wide interrupt, can hold ; so bent he seems \r\\On desperate revenge, that shall redound \rI Upon his own rebellious head. And now, \r\'Through all restraint broke loose, he wings his way \rNot far off Heaven, in the precincts of light, \r\r\r\r/6 PARADISE LOST. \r\rf Directly towards the new-created World, \r\r" And Man there placed, with purpose to assay 90 \r\rIf him by force he can destroy, or, worse, \rBy some false guile pervert : and shall pervert ; \rFor Man will hearken to his glozing lies, \rAnd easily transgress the sole command, \rSole pledge of his obedience; so will fall \rHe and his faithless progeny. Tvhose fault? \rWhose but his own? Ingrate, he had of me \rAll he could have; I made him just and right, \rSufficient to have stood, though free to fall. \rSuch I created all the ethereal powers 100 \r\rAnd Spirits, both them who stood and them who failed : \rFreely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. \rNot free, what proof could they have given sincere \rOf true allegiance, constant faith, or love, \rWhere only what they needs must do appeared, \rNot what they would? what praise could they receive, \rWhat pleasure I, from such obedience paid, \rWhen will and reason reason also is choice- \rUseless and vain, of freedom both despoiled, \rMade passive both, had served necessity, no \r\rNot me?J They therefore, as to right belonged, \rSo were created, nor can justly accuse \rTheir Maker, or their making, or their fate, \rAs if predestination overruled \rTheir will, disposed by absolute decree \rOr high foreknowledge. They themselves decreed \rTheir own revolt, not I : if I foreknew, \rForeknowledge had no influence on their fault, \rWhich had no less proved certain unforeknown. \rSo without least impulse or shadow of fate, 120 \r\rOr aught by me immutably foreseen, \r\r\r\rBOOK III. 77 \r\rThey trespass, authors to themselves in all, \rBoth what they judge and what they choose; for so \rI formed them free, and free they must remain \rTill they enthrall themselves : I else must change \rTheir nature, and revoke the high decree \rUnchangeable, eternal, which ordained \rTheir freedom ; they themselves ordained their fall. \rThe first sort by their own suggestion fell,.- \rSelf-tempted, self-depraved ; JVlan. Jalls^.. deceived 130 \r\rBy the other first: Man therefore- -shall find grace; \rThejDther, none. In mercy and justice both,. \rThrough Heaven and Earth, so shall my glory excel; \r.But mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine." \r\rThus while God spake ambrosial fragrance filled \rAll Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect \rSense of new joy ineffable diffused. \rBeyond compare the Son of God was seen \rMost glorious; in him all his Father shone \rSubstantially expressed ; and in his face 140 \r\rDivine compassion visibly appeared, \rLove without end, and without measure grace; \rWhich uttering, thus he to his Father spake : \r\r"O Father, gracious was that word which closed \rThy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace; \rFor which both Heaven and Earth shall high extol \rThy praises, with the innumerable sound \rOf hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne \rEncompassed shall resound thee ever blest. \rFor should Man finally be lost, should Man, 150 \r\rThy creature late so loved, thy youngest son, \rFall circumvented thus by fraud, though joined \rWith his own folly? that be from thee far, \rThat far be from thee, Father, who art judge \r\r\r\r78 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOf all things made, and judgest only right! \r\rOr shall the Adversary thus obtain \r\rHis end, and frustrate thine? shall he fulfil \r\rHis malice, and thy goodness bring to naught? \r\rOr proud return, though to his heavier doom, \r\rYet with revenge accomplished, and to Hell 160 \r\rDraw after him the whole race of mankind, \r\rBy him corrupted? or wilt thou thyself \r\rAbolish thy creation, and unmake, \r\rFor him, what for thy glory thou hast made? \r\rSo should thy goodness and thy greatness both \r\rBe questioned and blasphemed without defence." \r\rTo whom the great Creator thus replied : \r"O Son, in whom my soul hath chief delight, \rSon of my bosom, Son who art alone \rMy word, my wisdom, and effectual might, 170 \r\rAll hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all \rAs my eternal purpose hath decreed. \rMan shall not quite be lost, but saved who will; \rYet not of will in him, but grace in me \rFreely vouchsafed. Once more I will renew \rHis lapsed powers, though forfeit, and enthralled \rBy sin to foul exorbitant desires : \rUpheld by me, yet once more he shall stand \rOn even ground against his mortal foe; \rBy me upheld, that he may know how frail 180 \r\rHis fallen condition is, and to me owe \rAll his deliverance, and to none but me. \rSome I have chosen of peculiar grace, \rElect above the rest ; so is my will : \rThe rest shall hear me call, and oft be warned \rTheir sinful state, and to appease betimes \rThe incensed Deity, while offered grace \r\r\r\rBOOK III. 79 \r\rInvites; for I will clear their senses dark, \rWhat may suffice, and soften stony hearts \rTo pray, repent, and bring obedience due. 190 \r\rTo prayer, repentance, and obedience due, \rThough but endeavoured with sincere intent, \rMine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. \rAnd I will place within them as a guide \rMy umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear, \rLight after light well used they shall attain, \rAnd to the end persisting safe arrive. \rThis my long sufferance and my day of grace \rThey who neglect and scorn shall never taste; \rBut hard be hardened, blind be blinded more, 200 \r\rThat they may stumble on, and deeper fall; \rAnd none but such from mercy I exclude. \rBut yet all is not done. Man, disobeying, \rDisloyal breaks his fealty, and sins \rAgainst the high supremacy of Heaven, \rAffecting Godhead, and so, losing all, \rTo expiate his treason . hath naught left, \rBut, to destruction sacred and devote, \rHe with his whole posterity must die- \rDie he or justice must; unless for him 210 \rSome other, able and as willing, pay \rThe rigid satisfaction, death for death. \rSay, Heavenly powers, where shall we find such love? \rWhich of ye will be mortal, to redeem \rMan\'s mortal crime, and just the unjust to save? \rDwells in all Heaven charity so dear?" \r\rHe asked, but all the Heavenly quire stood mute, \rAnd silence was in Heaven : on Man\'s behalf \rPatron or intercessor none appeared \rMuch less that durst upon his own head draw 220 \r\r\r\r80 PARADISE LOST. \r\rThe deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. \r\rAnd now without redemption all mankind \r\rMust have been lost, adjudged to Death and Hell \r\rBy doom severe, had not the Son of God, \r\rIn whom the fulness dwells of love divine, \r\rHis dearest mediation thus renewed : \r\r" Father, thy word is passed, Man shall find grace ; \rAnd shall grace not find means, that finds her way, \rThe speediest of thy winged messengers, \rTo Visit all thy creatures, and to all 230 \r\rComes unprevented, unimplored, unsought? \rHappy for Man, so coming ! He her aid \rCan never seek, once dead in sins and lost; \rAtonement for himself, or offering meet, \rIndebted and undone, hath none to bring. \rBehold me, then : me for him, life for life, \rI offer; on me let thine anger fall; \rAccount me Man : I for his sake will leave \rThy bosom, and this glory next to thee \rFreely put off, and for him lastly die 240 \r\rWell pleased ; on me let Death wreak all his rage : \rUnder his gloomy power I shall not long \rLie vanquished : thou hast given me to possess \rLife in myself for ever ; by thee I live ; \rThough now to Death I yield, and am his due, \rAll that of me can die, yet, that debt paid, \rThou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave, \rHis prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul \rFor ever with corruption there to dwell; \rBut I shall rise victorious, and subdue 250 \r\rMy vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil. \rDeath his death\'s wound shall then receive, and stoop \rInglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed; \r\r\r\r\r\r\rBOOK III. 8 1 \r\rI through the ample air in triumph high \r\rShall lead Hell captive maugre Hell, and show \r\rThe powers of Darkness bound. Thou, at the sight \r\rPleased, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, \r\rWhile, by thee raised, I ruin all my foes, \r\rDeath last, and with his carcase glut the grave; \r\rThen, with the multitude of my redeemed, 260 \r\rShall enter Heaven, long absent, and return. \r\rFather, to see thy face, wherein no cloud \r\rOf anger shall remain, but peace assured \r\rAnd reconcilement : wrath shall be no more \r\rThenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire." \r\rHis words here ended; but his meek aspect \rSilent yet spake, and breathed immortal love \rTo mortal men, above which only shone \rFilial obedience : as a sacrifice \r\rGlad to be offered, he attends the will 270 \r\rOf his great Father. Admiration seized \rAll Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend, \rWondering ; but soon the Almighty thus replied : \r\r" O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace \rFound out for mankind under wrath, O thou \rMy sole complacence ! well thou know\'st how dear \rTo me are all my works ; nor Man the least, \rThough last created, that for him I spare \rThee from my bosom and right hand, to save, \rBy losing thee a while, the whole race lost ! 280 \r\rThou therefore, whom thou only canst redeem, \rTheir nature also to thy nature join; \rAnd be thyself Man among men on Earth, \rMade flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed, \rBy wondrous birth; be thou in Adam\'s room \rThe head of all mankind, though Adam\'s son. \r\rP. L. < \r\r\r\r82 PARADISE LOST. \r\rAs in him perish all men, so in thee, \r\rAs from a second root, shall be restored \r\rAs many as are restored ; without thee, none. \r\rHis crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit, 290 \r\rImputed, shall absolve them who renounce \r\rTheir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, \r\rAnd live in thee transplanted, and from thee \r\rReceive new life. So Man, as is most just, \r\rShall satisfy for Man, be judged and die, \r\rAnd dying rise, and rising with him raise \r\rHis brethren, ransomed with his own dear life. \r\rSo Heavenly love shall outdo Hellish hate, \r\rGiving to death, and dying to redeem, \r\rSo dearly to redeem what Hellish hate 300 \r\rSo easily destroyed, and still destroys \r\rIn those who, when they may, accept not grace. \r\rNor shalt thou, by descending to assume \r\rMan\'s nature, lessen or degrade thine own. \r\rBecause thou hast, though throned in highest bliss \r\rEqual to God, and equally enjoying \r\rGod-like fruition, quitted all to save \r\rA world from utter loss, and hast been found \r\rBy merit more than birthright Son of God \r\rFound worthiest to be so by being good, 310 \r\rFar more than great or high ; because in thee \r\rLove hath abounded more than glory abounds; \r\rTherefore thy humiliation shall exalt \r\rWith thee thy manhood also to this throne : \r\rHere shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign \r\rBoth God and Man, Son both of God and Man, \r\rAnointed universal King. All power \r\rI give thee; reign for ever, and assume \r\rThy merits; under thee, as Head supreme, \r\r\r\rBOOK III. 83 \r\rThrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce: 320 \r\rAll knees to thee shall bow of them that bide \r\rIn Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell. \r\rWhen thou, attended gloriously from Heaven, \r\rShalt in the sky appear, and from thee send \r\rThe summoning Archangels to proclaim \r\rThy dread tribunal, forthwith from all winds \r\rThe living, and forthwith the cited dead \r\rOf all past ages, to the general doom \r\rShall hasten : such a peal shall rouse their sleep. \r\rThen, all thy Saints assembled, thou shalt judge 330 \r\rBad men and Angels; they arraigned shall sink \r\rBeneath thy sentence ; Hell, her numbers full, \r\rThenceforth shall be for ever shut. Meanwhile \r\rThe World shall burn, and from her ashes spring \r\rNew Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell, \r\rAnd after all their tribulations long \r\rSee golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, \r\rWith Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. \r\rThen thou thy regal sceptre shalt lay by, \r\rFor regal sceptre then no more shall need; 340 \r\rGod shall be all in all. But all ye gods, \r\rAdore him who, to compass all this, dies; \r\rAdore the Son, and honour him as me." \r\rNo sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all \rThe multitude of Angels, with a shout \rLoud as from numbers without number, sweet \rAs from blest voices, uttering joy Heaven rung \rWith jubilee, and loud hosannas filled \rThe eternal regions. Lowly reverent \r\rTowards either throne they bow, and to the ground 350 \rWith solemn adoration down they cast \rTheir crowns inwove with amarant and gold : \r\r62 \r\r\r\r84 PARADISE LOST. \r\rImmortal amarant, a flower which once \rIn Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life, \rBegan to bloom, but soon for Man\'s offence \rTo Heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows \rAnd flowers aloft, shading the Fount of Life, \rAnd where the River of Bliss through midst of Heaven \rRolls o\'er Elysian flowers her amber stream. \rWith these that never fade the Spirits elect 360 \r\rBind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams. \rNow in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright \rPavement, that like a sea of jasper shone, \rImpurpled with celestial roses smiled. \rThen, crowned again, their golden harps they took, \rHarps ever tuned, that glittering by their side \rLike quivers hung; and with preamble sweet \rOf charming symphony they introduce \rTheir sacred song, and waken raptures high : \rNo voice exempt, no voice but well could join 370 \r\rMelodious part; such concord is in Heaven. \rThee, Father, first they sung, Omnipotent, \r\r\' Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, \rEternal King ; thee, Author of all being, \rFountain of light, thyself invisible \r\r\' Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitt\'st \rThroned inaccessible, but when thou shadest \rThe full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud \rDrawn round about thee like a radiant shrine \rDark with excessive bright thy skirts appear, 380 \r\rYet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim \rApproach not, but with both wings veil their eyes. \rThee next they sang, of all creation first, \rBegotten Son, Divine Similitude, \rIn whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud \r\r\r\rBOOK III. 85 \r\rMade visible, the Almighty Father shines, \r\rWhom else no creature can behold : on thee \r\rImpressed the effulgence of his glory abides ; \r\rTransfused on thee his ample Spirit rests. \r\rHe Heaven of Heavens, and all the powers therein, 390 \r\rBy thee created; and by thee threw down \r\rThe aspiring Dominations. Thou that day \r\rThy Father\'s dreadful thunder didst not spare, \r\rNor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels, that shook \r\rHeaven\'s everlasting frame, while o\'er the necks \r\rThou drov\'st of warring Angels disarrayed. \r\rBack from pursuit, thy powers with loud acclaim \r\rThee only extolled, Son of thy Father\'s might, \r\rTo execute fierce vengeance on his foes; \r\rNot so on Man; him, through their malice fallen, 400 \r\rFather of mercy and grace, thou didst not doom \r\rSo strictly, but much more to pity incline. \r\rNo sooner did thy dear and only Son \r\rPerceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man \r\rSo strictly, but much more to pity inclined, \r\rHe, to appease thy wrath, and end the strife \r\rOf mercy and justice in thy face discerned, \r\rRegardless of the bliss wherein he sat \r\rSecond to thee, offered himself to die \r\rFor Man\'s offence. O unexampled love ! 410 \r\rLove nowhere to be found less than divine! \r\rHail, Son of God, Saviour of men ! Thy name \r\rShall be the copious matter of my song \r\rHenceforth, and never shall my harp thy praise \r\rForget, nor from thy Father\'s praise disjoin ! \r\rThus they in Heaven, above the starry sphere, \rTheir happy hours in joy and hymning spent. \rMeanwhile, upon the firm opacous globe \r\r\r\r86 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOf this round World, whose first convex divides \r\rThe luminous inferior orbs, enclosed 420 \r\rFrom Chaos and the inroad of Darkness old, \r\rSatan alighted walks. A globe far off \r\rIt seemed; now seems a boundless continent, \r\rDark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night \r\rStarless exposed, and ever-threatening storms \r\rOf Chaos blustering round, inclement sky; \r\rSave on that side which from the wall of Heaven, \r\rThough distant far, some small reflection gains \r\rOf glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud : \r\rHere walked the Fiend at large in spacious field. 430 \r\rAs when a vulture on Imaus bred, \r\rWhose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds, \r\rDislodging from a region scarce of prey, \r\rTo gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids \r\rOn hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs \r\rOf Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; \r\rBuTm his* way tignTson the barren plains \r\rOf Sericana, where Chineses drive \r\rWith sails and wind their cany waggons light: \r\rSo, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend 440 \r\rWalked up and down alone, bent on his prey; \r\rAlone, for other creature in this place, \r\rLiving or lifeless, to be found was none \r\rNone yet; but store hereafter from the Earth \r\rUp hither like aerial vapours flew \r\rOf all things transitory and vain, when sin \r\rWith vanity had filled the works of men : \r\rBoth all things vain, and all who in vain things \r\rBuilt their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame, \r\rOr happiness in this or the other life. 450 \r\rAll who have their reward on earth, the fruits \r\r\r\rBOOK III. 87 \r\rOf painful superstition and blind zeal, \r\rNaught seeking but the praise of men, here find \r\rFit retribution, empty as their deeds; \r\rAll the unaccomplished works of Nature\'s hand, \r\rAbortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed, \r\rDissolved on Earth, fleet hither, and in vain, \r\rTill final dissolution, wander here; \r\rNot in the neighbouring moon, as some have dreamed : \r\rThose argent fields more likely habitants, 460 \r\rTranslated saints, or middle Spirits, hold, \r\rBetwixt the angelical and human kind. \r\rHither, of ill-joined sons and daughters born, \r\rFirst from the ancient world those giants came, \r\rWith many a vain exploit, though then renowned; \r\rThe builders next of Babel on the plain \r\rOf Sennaar, and still with vain design \r\rNew Babels, had they wherewithal, would build; \r\rOthers came single : he who, to be deemed \r\rA god, leaped fondly into ^Etna flames, 470 \r\rEmpedocles ; and he who, to enjoy \r\rPlato\'s Elysium, leaped into the sea, \r\rCleombrptiis,; and many more, too long, \r\rEmbryos and idiots, eremites and friars, \r\rWhite, black, and grey, with all their trumpery. \r\rHere pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek \r\rIn Golgotha him dead who lives in Heaven; \r\rAnd they who, to be sure of Paradise, \r\rDying put on the weeds of Dominic, \r\rOr in Franciscan think to pass disguised. 480 \r\rThey pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed, \r\rAnd that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs \r\rThe trepidation talked, and that first moved; \r\rAnd now Saint Peter at Heaven\'s wicket seems \r\r\r\r88 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTo wait them with his keys, and now at foot \r\rOf Heaven\'s ascent they lift their feet, when, lo ! \r\rA violent cross wind from either coast \r\rBlows them transverse, ten thousand leagues awry, \r\rInto the devious air. Then might ye see \r\rCowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost 490 \r\rAnd fluttered into rags; then reliques, beads, \r\rIndulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls, \r\rThe sport of winds : all these, upwhirled aloft, \r\rFly o\'er the backside of the World far off \r\rInto a limbo large and broad, since called \r\rThe Paradise of Fools; to few unknown \r\rLong after, now unpeopled and untrod. \r\rAll this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed; \r\\ And long he wandered, till at last a gleam \r\\Of dawning light turned thitherward in haste 500 \r\rfHis travelled steps. Far distant he descries, \rAscending by degrees magnificent \rUp to the wall of Heaven, a structure high; \rAt top whereof, but far more rich, appeared \rThe work as of a kingly palace-gate, \rWith frontispiece of diamond and gold \rEmbellished; thick with sparkling orient gems \rThe portal shone, inimitable on Earth \rBy model, or by shading pencil drawn. \rThe stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw 510 \r\rAngels ascending and descending, bands \rOf guardians bright, when he from Esau fled \rTo Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz \rDreaming by night under the open sky, \rAnd waking cried, "This is the gate of Heaven." \rEach stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood \rThere always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes \r\r\r\rBOOK III. 89 \r\rViewless ; and underneath a bright sea flowed \r\rOf jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon \r\rWho after came from Earth sailing arrived, 520 \r\rWafted by Angels, or flew o\'er the lake, \r\rRapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds. \r\rThe stairs were then let down, whether to dare \r\rThe Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate \r\rHis sad exclusion from the doors of bliss ; \r\rDirect against which opened from beneath, \r\rJust o\'er the blissful seat of Paradise, \r\rA passage down to the Earth, a passage wide; \r\rWider by far than that of after-times \r\rOver Mount Sion, and, though that were large, 530 \r\rOver the Promised Land to God so dear; \r\rBy which, to visit oft those happy tribes, \r\rOn high behests his Angels to and fro \r\rPassed frequent, and his eye with choice regard, \r\rFrom Paneas, the fount of Jordan\'s flood, \r\rTo Begisaha* where the Holy Land \r\rBorders on Egypt and. the Arabian shore. \r\rSo wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set \r\rTo darkness, such as bound the ocean wave. \r\rSatan from hence, now on the lower stair, 540 \r\rThat scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate, \rLdoks"Hown with wonder at the sudden view \rOf all this World at once. As when a scout, \rThrough dark and desert ways with peril gone \rAll night, at last by break of cheerful dawn \rObtains the brow of some high-climbing hill, \rWhich to his eye discovers unaware \r|The goodly prospect of some foreign land \rtirst seen, or some renowned metropolis \rjVith glistering spires and pinnacles adorned, 550 \r\r\r\r9O PARADISE LOST. \r\rWhich now the rising sun gilds with his beams : \r\rSuch wonder seized, though after Heaven seen, \r\rThe Spirit malign, but much more envy seized, \r\rAt sight of all this World beheld so fair. \r\rRound he surveys (and well might where he stood, \r\rSo high above the circling canopy \r\rOf Night\'s extended shade) from eastern point \r\rOf Libra to the fleecy star that bears \r\rAndromeda far off Atlantic seas \r\rBeyond the horizon; then from pole to pole 560 \r\rHe views in breadth; and, without longer pause, \r\rDown right into the World\'s first region throws \r\rHis flight precipitant, and winds with ease \r\rThrough the pure marble air his oblique way \r\rAmongst innumerable stars, that shone \r\rStars distant, but nigh-hand seemed other worlds. \r\rOr other worlds they seemed, or happy isles, \r\rLike those Hesperian Gardens famed of old, \r\rFortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales, \r\rThrice happy isles; but who dwelt happy there 570 \r\rHe stayed not to inquire. Above them all \r\rThe golden sun, in splendour likest Heaven, \r\rAllured his eye. Thither his course he bends, \r\rThrough the calm firmament (but up or down, \r\rBy centre or eccentric, hard to tell, \r\rOr longitude) where the great luminary, \r\rAloof the vulgar constellations thick, \r\rThat from his lordly eye keep distance due, \r\rDispenses light from far. They, as they move \r\rTheir starry dance in numbers that compute 580 \r\rDays, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp \r\rTurn swift their various motions, or are turned \r\rBy his magnetic beam, that gently warms \r\r\r\rBOOK III. 91 \r\rThe Universe, and to each inward part \rWith gentle penetration, though unseen, \rShoots invisible virtue even to the deep; \rSo wondrously was set his station bright. \r\rThere lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps \rAstronomer in the sun\'s lucent orb \r\rThrough his glazed optic tube yet never saw. 590 \r\rThe place he found beyond expression bright, \rCompared with aught on Earth, metal or stone; \r\' Not all parts like, but all alike informed \r1 With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire : \r1 If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear ; \r\\If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite, \rRuby or topaz, to tjffi J-WAW ti<- chnn^ \rIn Aaron\'s breast-plate, and a stone besides, \rImagined rather oft than elsewhere seen \rThat stone, or like to that, which here below 600 \r\rPhilosophers in vain so long have sought; \rIn vain, though by their powerful art they bind \rVolatile Hermes, and call up unbound \rIn various shapes old Proteus from the sea, \rDrained through a limbec to his native form. \rWhat wonder then if fields and regions here \rBreathe forth elixir pure, and rivers run \rPotable gold, when, with one virtuous touch, \rThe arch-chemic sun, so far from us remote, \rProduces, with terrestrial humour mixed, 610 \r\rHere in the dark so many precious things \rOf colour glorious and effect so rare? \rHere matter new to gaze the Devil met \rUndazzled. Far and wide his eye commands; \rFor sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, \rBut all sunshine, as when his beams at noon \r\r\r\r92 PARADISE LOST. \r\rCulminate from the equator, as they now \r\rShot upward still direct, whence no way round \r\rShadow from body opaque can fall ; and the air, \r\rNowhere so clear, sharpened his visual ray 620 \r\rTo objects distant far, whereby he soon \r\rSaw within ken a glorious Angel stand, \r\rThe same whom John saw also in the sun. \r\rHis back was turned, but not his brightness hid; \r\rOf beaming sunny rays a golden tiar \r\rCircled his head, nor less his locks behind \r\rIllustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings \r\rLay waving round : on some great charge employed \r\rHe seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep. \r\rGlad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope 630 \r\rI To find who might direct his wandering flight \r\r\\ To Paradise, the happy seat of Man, \r\r\\His journey\'s end, and our beginning woe. \r\r\'jBut first he casts to change his proper shape, \r\r^Vhich else might work him danger or delay: \r\rAnd now a stripling Cherub he appears, \r\rNot of the prime, yet such as in his face \r\rYouth smiled celestial, and to every limb \r\rSuitable grace diffused; so well he feigned. \r\rUnder a coronet his flowing hair 640 \r\rIn curls on either cheek played; wings he wore \r\rOf many a coloured plume sprinkled with gold, \r\rHis habit fit for speed succinct; and held \r\rBefore his decent steps a silver wand. \r\rHe drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright, \r\rEre he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned, \r\rAdmonished by his ear, and straight was known \r\rThe Archangel Uriel; one of the seven \r\rWho in God\'s presence, nearest to his throne, \r\r\r\rBOOK III. 93 \r\rStand ready at command, and are his eyes 650 \r\rThat run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth \rBear his swift errands over moist and dry, \rO\'er sea and land. Him Satan thus accosts : \r\r" Uriel ! for thou of those seven Spirits that stand \rIn sight of God\'s high throne, gloriously bright, \rThe first art wont his great authentic will \rInterpreter through highest Heaverf to bring, \rWhere all his Sons thy embassy attend ; \rAnd here art likeliest by supreme decree \rLike honour to obtain, and as his eye 660 \r\rTo visit oft this new creation round ; \rUnspeakable desire to see and know \rAll these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, \rHis chief delight and favour, him for whom \rAll these his works so wondrous he ordained, \rHath brought me from the quires of Cherubim \rAlone thus wandering. Brightest Seraph, tell \rIn which of all these shining orbs hath Man \rHis fixed seat; or fixed seat hath none, \rBut all these shining orbs his choice to dwell; 670 \r\rThat I may find him, and with secret gaze \rOr open admiration him behold \rOn whom the great Creator hath bestowed \rWorlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured; \rThat both in him and all things, as is meet, \rThe Universal Maker we may praise; \rWho justly hath driven out his rebel foes \rTo deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss, \rCreated this new happy race of Men \rTo serve him better: wise are all his ways!" 680 \r\rSo spake the false dissembler unperceived; \rFor neither man nor Angel can discern \r\r\r\r94 PARADISE LOST. \r\rHypocrisy, the only evil that walks \r\rInvisible, except to God alone, \r\rBy his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth; \r\rAnd oft, though Wisdom wake, Suspicion sleeps \r\rAt Wisdom\'s gate, and to Simplicity \r\rResigns her charge, while Goodness thinks no ill \r\rWhere no ill seems : which now for once beguiled \r\rUriel, though regent of the sun, and held 690 \r\rThe sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven; \r\rWho to the fraudulent impostor foul, \r\rIn his uprightness, answer thus returned: \r\r"Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know \rThe works of God, thereby to glorify \rThe great Work-master, leads to no excess \rThat reaches blame, but rather merits praise \rThe more it seems excess, that led thee hither \rFrom thy empyreal mansion thus alone, \rTo witness with thine eyes what some perhaps, 700 \r\rCon tented with report, hear only in Heaven; \rFor wonderful indeed are all his works, \rPleasant to know, and worthiest to be all \rHad in remembrance always with delight! \rBut what created mind can comprehend \rTheir number, or the wisdom infinite \rThat brought them forth, but hid their causes deep? \rI saw when at his word the formless mass, \rThis World\'s material mould, came to a heap: \rConfusion heard his voice, and wild uproar 710 \r\rStood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined; \rTill at his second bidding Darkness fled, \rLight shone, and order from disorder sprung. \rSwift to their several quarters hasted then \rThe cumbrous elements earth, flood, air, fire; \r\r\r\rBOOK III. 95 \r\rAnd this ethereal quintessence of Heaven \r\rFlew upward, spirited with various forms, \r\rThat rolled orbicular, and turned to stars \r\rNumberless, as thou seest, and how they move; \r\rEach had his place appointed, each his course; 720 \r\rThe rest in circuit walls this Universe. \r\rLook downward on that globe, whose hither side \r\rWith light from hence, though but reflected, shines : \r\rThat place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light \r\rHis day, which else, as the other hemisphere, \r\rNight would invade; but there the neighbouring moon \r\r(So call that opposite fair star) her aid \r\rTimely interposes, and, her monthly round \r\rStill ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven, \r\rWith borrowed light her countenance triform 730 \r\rHence fills and empties, to enlighten the Earth, \r\rAnd in her pale dominion checks the night. \r\rThat spot to which I point is Paradise, \r\rAdam\'s abode; those lofty shades his bower. \r\rThy way thou canst not miss; me mine requires." \r\rThus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low, \rAs to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, \rWhere honour due and reverence none neglects, \rTook leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, \rDown from the ecliptic, sped with hoped success, 740 \rThrows his steep flight in many an aery wheel, \rNor stayed till on Niphates\' top he lights. \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. \r\r\r\rP. L. \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\r\r\rSatan, now in prospect of Eden, and nigh the place where he must \rnow attempt the bold enterprise which he undertook alone against God \rand Man, falls into many doubts with himself, and many passions \rfear, envy, and despair; but at length Confirms himself in evil ; journeys \ron to Paradise, whose outward prospect and situation is described; \roverleaps the bounds; sits, in the shape of a cormorant, on the Tree \rof Life, as highest in the Garden, to look about him. The Garden \rdescribed: Satan\'s first sight of Adam and Eve; his wonder at their \rpvrfllpnt form and happy state, but with resolutiflnj^ work their fall; \roverhears their discourse ; thence gathers that the Tree of Knowledge \rwas forbidden them to eat of under penalty of death, and thereon \rintends to found his temptation &y seducing thenTTcTtransgress ; then \rleaves them a while, to know further of their state by some other \rmeans. Meanwhile Uriel, descending on a sunbeam, warns Gabriel, \rwho had in charge the gate of Paradise, that some evil Spirit had \rescaped the Deep, and passed at noon by his Sphere, in the shape of a \rgood Angel, down to Paradise ; discovered after by his furious gestures \rin the mount. Gabriel promises to find him ere morning. Night \rcoming on, Adam and Eve discourse of going to their rest : their bower \rdescribed; their evening worship. Gabriel, drawing forth his bands of \rnight-watch to walk the rounds of Paradise, appoints two strong Angels \rto Adam\'s bower, lest the evil Spirit should be there doing some harm \rto Adam or Eve sleeping : there they find him at the ear- of Eve, \rtempting her in a dream, and bring him, though unwilling, to Gabriel; \rby whom questioned, he scornfully answers, prepares resistance, but, \rhindered by a sign from Heaven, flies out of Paradise. \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. \r\r\r\rOFOR that warning voice, which he who saw \rThe Apocalypse heard cry in Heaven aloud, \rThen when the Dragon, put to second rout, \rCame furious down to be revenged on men, \r"Woe to the inhabitants on Earth!" that now, \rWhile time was, our first parents had been warned \rThe coming of their secret foe, and scaped, \rHaply so scaped, his mortal snare ! For now \rSatan, now first inflamed with rage, came down, \rThe tempter ere the accuser of mankind, 10 \r\rTo wreak on innocent frail Man his loss \rOf that first battle, and his flight to Hell : \rYet not rejoicing in his speed, though bold \rFar off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, \rBegins his dire attempt; which, nigh the birth \rNow rolling, boils in his tumultuous breast, \rAnd like a devilish engine back recoils \rUpon himself. Horror and doubt distract \rHis troubled thoughts, and from" the bottom stir \rThe hell within him; for within him Hell 20 \r\rHe brings, and round about him, nor from Hell \rOne step, no more than from himself, can fly \r\r72 \r\r\r\r\r\r\ri re/ #wy \r\rIOO PARADISE LOST. \r\rBy change of place. Now conscience_ wakes despair \rThat slumbered; wakes the bitter memory \rOf what he was, what is, and what must be \rWorse : of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue ! \rSometimes towards Eden, which now in his view \rLay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad; \rSometimes towards Heaven and the full-blazing sun, \rWhich now sat high in his meridian tower : 30 \r\rThen, much revolving, thus in sighs began : \r\r"O thou that, with surpassing glory crowned, \rLook\'st from thy sole dominion like the god \rOf this new World ; at whose sight all the stars \rHide their diminished heads; ,to thee I call, \r\r\\ But with no friendly voice, ^aj^i add thy name, \rsZ-^ O Sun, to tell thee how I {hate) thy beams^ \r\rThat bring to my remembrance from what state \r\rj I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere, c% \rTill pride and worse ambition threw me down, 40 \r\rWarringjn Heaven against Heaven\'sjnatchless King ! \rAh, wherefore ? He~deserved no such return \r\r/ From me, whom he created what I was \rIn that bright eminence, and with his good \rUpbraided none; nor was his service hard. \rWhat could be less than to afford him praise, \r\r! \\ The easiest recompense, and pay him thanks, \r\r; How due ? Yet all his good proved ill in me, \rAnd wrought but malice. ^Lifted up so high, \rI sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher 50 \rWould set me highest, and in a moment quit \rThe debt immense of endless gratitude, \rSo burdensome, still paying, still to owe; \rForgetful what from him I still received; \rAnd understood not that a grateful mind \r\r\r\r\rBOOK IV. 101 \r\rBy owing owes not, but still pays, at once \r\rIndebted and discharged what burden then? \r\rOh, had his powerful destiny ordained \r\rMe some inferior Angel, I had stood \r\rThen happy; no unbounded hope had raised 60 \r\rAmbition. Yet why not? some other power \r\rAs great might have aspired, and me, though mean, \r\rDrawn to his part. But other powers as great \r\rFell not, but stand unshaken, from within \r\rOr from without, to all temptations armed. \r\rHa^isJ_JhojyLlke_^ stand ? \r\rThou hadst. Whom hast thou then, or what, to accuse, \r\rBut Heaven\'s freej lovejdealt equajly^jo all?__ \r\rBe then his love accursed, since, love or hate, \r\rTo me alike it deals eternal woe. 70 \r\rNay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will \r\rChose freely what it now so justly rues. \r\rMe miserable ! which way shall I fly \r\rInfinite wrath ajid infinite despair? \r\rWhichway I^7^s~lTelTpmyW-am Hell; ^ \r\rAnd, in the lowest deep, a lower deep \r\rStill threatening to devour me opens wide, - \r\rTo which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven. \r\rO, then, at last relent ! Is there no place \r\rLeft for repentance, none for pardon left? - i 80 \r\rNone left but by submission; and that word \r\rDisdain forbids me, and my dread of shame \r\rAmong the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced \r\rWith other promises and other vaunts \r\rThan to submit, boasting I could subdue \r\rThe Omnipotent. Ay me ! they little know \r\rHow dearly I abide that boast so vain, \r\rUnder what torments inwardly I groan. \r\r\r\r\r102 PARADISE LOST. \r\rWhile they adore me on the throne of Hell, \r\rWith diadem and sceptre high advanced, 90 \r\rThe^ lower stilLJ-feiy only supreme \r\rIn^misery : such joy ambition "finds ! \r\rBut say I could repent, and could obtain \r\rBy act of grace my former state ; how soon \r\rWould highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay \r\rWhat feigned, submission swore ! Ease would recant \r\rVows made in pain, as violent and void \r\rIFor never can true reconcilement grow \rWhere wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep \r\rWhich would but lead me to a worse relapse 100 \r\rAnd heavier fall : so should I purchase dear \rj Short intermission, bought with double smart. \rI This knows my Punisher; therefore as far \r| From granting he, as I from begging, peace. \r\rAll hope excludedr-thusr -behold, instead \r\rOf us, outcast, exiled, his new delight, \r\rMankind created, and for himthis World! \r\rSo farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear, \r\rFarJwenjimoTse j All good to me is lost ; \r\rEvil L be thou my goodT by thee at least no \r\rDivided ^empire with^Hgaveifs King I hold, \r\rBy thee, and more than half perhaps will reign ; \rI As Man ere long and this new World shall know." * \rThus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face, \r\rThrice changed with pale ire, envy, and despair; \r\rWhich marred his borrowed visage, and betrayed \r\rHim counterfeit, if any eye beheld; \r\rFor Heavenly minds from such distempers foul \r\rAre ever clear. Whereof he soon aware \r\rEach perturbation smoothed with outward calm, 120 \r\rArtificer of fraud; and was the first \r\r\r\rHOOK IV. IO3 \r\rThat practised falsehood under saintly show, \r\rDeep malice to conceal, couched with revenge: \r\rYet not enough had practised to deceive \r\rUriel, once warned; whose eye pursued him down \r\rThe way he went, and on the Assyrian mount \r\rSaAaLMnX-disfigured, rnj^rje..than^cmiTcT^r5eTair " \r\rSpirit of happy sort: his gestures fierce \r\rHejnarked and. mad demeanour, then, alone, \r\rAs he supposed, all unobserved, unseen. 130 \r\rSo on he fares, and to the border comes \rOf Eden, where delicious Paradise, * \r\rNow nearer, crowns with her enclosure green, \rAs with a rural mound, the champain head \rOf a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides \rWith thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild, \rAccess denied; and overhead up-grew \rInsuperable highth of loftiest shade, \rCedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm, \rA sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend 140 \r\rShade above shade, a woody theatre \rOf stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops \rThe verdurous wall of Paradise up-sprung; \rWhich to our general sire gave prospect large \rInto his nether empire neighbouring round. \rAnd higher than that wall a circling row \rOf goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit, \rBlossoms and fruits at once of golden hue, \rAppeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed ; \rOn which the sun more glad impressed his beams 150 \rThan in fair evening cloud, or humid bow, \rWhen God hath showered the earth : so lovely seemed \rThat landskip. And of pure now purer air \rMeets his approach, and to the heart inspires \r\r\r\r104 PARADISE LOST. \r\rVernal delight and joy, able to drive \rAll sadness but despair; now gentle gales, \rFanning their odoriferous wings, dispense \rNative perfumes, and whisper whence they stole \rThose balmy spoils. As when to them who sail \rBeyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past 160 \r\rMozarnbic, off at sea north-east winds blow \rSibaearTodours from the spicy shore \rOf 4raby the Blest: with such delay \rWell pleased they slack their course, and many a league \rCheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles: \rSo entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend \rWho came their bane, though with them better pleased \rThan Asmode\'us with the fishy fume \rThat drove^Kim, though enamoured, from the spouse \rOf Tobias, son, and with a vengeance sent 170 \r\rFrom Media post to Egypt, there fast bound. \rNow to the ascent of that steep savage hill \rSatan had journeyed on, pensive and slow; \rBut further way found none; so thick entwined, \rAs one continued brake, the undergrowth \rOf shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed \rAll path of man or beast that passed that way. \rOne gate there only was, and that looked east \rOn the other side : which when the Arch-Felon saw, \rDue entrance he disdained, and in contempt 180 \r\rAt one slight bound high overleaped all bound \rOf hill or highest wall, and sheer within \r.Lights on his feet. As when a prowling wolf, \rI Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, \ri Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve, \rjln hurdled cotes amid the field secure, \r^Leaps o\'er the fence with ease into the fold; \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. 105 \r\rlOr as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash \rOf some rich burgher, whose substantial doors, \rCross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault, 190 \r\rIn at the window climbs, or o\'er the tiles : \rSo clomb this first grand thief into God\'s fold : \rSo since into his Church lewd hirelings climb. \rThence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, \rThe middle tree and highest there that grew, \rSat like a cormorant; yet not true life \rThereby regained, but sat devising death \rTo them who lived ; nor on the virtue thought \rOf that life-giving plant, but only used \rFor prospect what, well used, had been the pledge 200 \rOf immortality. So little knows \rAny but God alone to value right \rThe good before him, but perverts best things \rTo worst abuse, or to their meanest use. \r\rBeneath him, with new wonder, now he views, \rTo all delight of human sense exposed, \rIn narrow room Nature\'s whole wealth; yea, more \rA Heaven on Earth; for blissful Paradise ** \rOf God the garden was, by him in the east \rOf Eden planted : Eden stretched her line 210 \r\rFrom Auran eastward to the royal towers \rOf great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings, \rOr wfiere^the sons of Eden long before \rDwelt in Telassar. In this pleasant soil \rHis far more pleasant garden God ordained. \rOut of the fertile ground he caused to grow \rAH trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; \rAnd all amid them stood the Tree of Life, \rHigh eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit \rOf vegetable gold; and next to life, 220 \r\r\r\r106 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOur death, the Tree of Knowledge, grew fast by \rKnowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill. \rSouthward through Eden went a river large, \rNor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill \rPassed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown \rThat mountain as his garden-mould, high raised \rUpon the rapid current, which, through veins \rOf porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn, \rRose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill \rWatered the garden ; thence united fell 230 \r\rDown the steep glade, and met the nether flood, \rWhich from his darksome passage now appears; \rAnd now, divided into four main streams, \rRuns diverse, wandering many a famous realm \rAnd country, whereof here needs no account; \rBut rather to tell how, if art could tell, \rHow from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks, \rRolling on orient pearl and sands of gold, \rWith mazy error under pendent shades \rRan nectar, visiting each plant, and fed 240 \r\rFlowers worthy of Paradise; which not nice art \rIn beds and curious knots, but Nature boon \rPoured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain, \rBoth where the morning sun first warmly smote \rvl The open field, and where the unpierced shade ^ \rImbrowned the noontide bowersj) Thus was this place, \rA happy rural seat of various view : \rGroves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm; \rOthers whose fruit, burnished with golden rind, \rHung amiable Hesperian fables true, 250 \r\rIf true, here only and of delicious taste. \rBetwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks \rGrazing the tender herb, were interposed, \r\r\r\r\r\r\rBOOK IV. \r\rOr palmy hillock; or the flowery lap \r\rOf some irriguous valley spread her store, \r\rFlowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose. \r\rAnother side, umbrageous grots and caves \r\rOf cool recess, o\'er which the mantling vine \r\rLays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps \r\rLuxuriant; meanwhile murmuring waters fall 260 \r\rDown the slope hills dispersed, or in a lake, \r\rThat to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned \r\rHer crystal mirror holds, unite their streams. \r\rThe birds their quire apply ; airs, vernal airs, \r\rBreathing the smell of field and grove, attune \r\rThe trembling leaves, while universal Pan, \r\rKnit with the Graces and the Hours in dance, \r\rLed on the eternal Spring. Not that fair field \r\rOf Enna, where Proserpin gathering flowers, \r\rHerself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis \r\rWas gathered which cost Ceres all that pain \r\rTo seek her through the world, nor that sweet grove \r\rOf Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired \r\rCastalian spring, might with this Paradise \r\rOf Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle, \r\rGirt with the river Triton, where old Cham, \r\rWhom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove, \r\rHid Amalthea, and her florid son, \r\rYoung Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea\'s eye; \r\rNor where Abassin kings their issue guard, 280 \r\rMount Amara, though this by some supposed \r\rTrue Paradise, under the Ethiop line \r\rBy Nilus\' head, enclosed with shining rock, \r\rA whole day\'s journey high, but wide remote \r\rFrom this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend \r\rSaw undelighted all delight, all kind \r\r\r\r108 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOf living creatures, new to sight and strange. \r\rTwo of far nobler shape, erect and tall, \rGod-like erect, with native honour clad, \rIn naked majesty seemed lords of all, 290 \r\rAnd worthy seemed ; for in their looks divine \rThe image of their glorious Maker shone, \rTruth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure \rSevere, but in true filial freedom placed, \rWhence true authority in men; though both \ri Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed : \rFor contemplation he and valour formed, \rFor softness she and sweet attractive grace; \r\rfor God only, she for God in him. ^ \rHis fair large front and eye sublime declared 300 \r\rAbsolute rule; and hyacinthine locks \rRound from his parted forelock manly hung \rClustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad: \rShe, as a veil down to the slender waist, \rHer unadorned golden tresses wore \rDishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved, \rAs the vine curls her tendrils vhich implied \rSubjection, but required with gentle sway, \rAnd by her yielded, by him best received, \rYielded with coy submission, modest pride, . 310 \r\rAnd sweet, reluctant, amorous delay. \rNor those mysterious parts were then concealed; \rThen was not guilty shame. Dishonest shame \rOf Nature\'s works, honour dishonourable, \rSin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind \rWith shows instead, mere shows of seeming pure, \rAnd banished from man\'s life his happiest life, \rSimplicity and spotless innocence ! \rSo passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. 109 \r\rOf God or Angel, for they thought no ill; 320 \r\rSo hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair \r\rThat ever since in love\'s embraces met : \r\rAdam the goodliest man of men since born \r\rHis sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve. \r\rUnder a tuft of shade that on a green \r\rStood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain-side, \r\rThey sat them down ; and after no more toil \r\rOf their sweet gardening labour than sufficed \r\rTo recommend cool Zephyr, and make ease \r\rMore easy, wholesome thirst and appetite 330 \r\rMore grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell, \r\rNectarine fruits, which the compliant boughs \r\rYielded them, sidelong as they sat recline \r\rOn the soft downy bank damasked with flowers. \r\rThe savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind, \r\rStill as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream; \r\rNor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles \r\rWanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems \r\rFair couple linked in .happy nuptial league, \r\rAlone as they. About them frisking played 340 \r\rAll beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase \r\rIn wood or wilderness, forest or den. \r\rSporting the lion ramped, and in his paw \r\rDandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards, \r\rGambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant, \r\rTo make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed \r\rHis lithe proboscis ; close the serpent sly, \r\rInsinuating, wove with Gordian twine \r\rHis braided train, and of his fatal guile \r\rGave proof unheeded. Others on the grass 350 \r\rCouched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat, \r\rOr bed ward ruminating; for the sun, \r\r\r\rHO PARADISE LOST. \r\rDeclined, was hastening now with prone career \rTo the Ocean Isles, and in the ascending scale \rOf Heaven the stars that usher evening rose: \rWhen Satan, still in gaze as first he stood, \rScarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad : \r\r" O Hell ! what do mine eyes with grief behold ? \rInto our room of bliss thus high advanced \rCreatures of other mould, Earth-born perhaps, 360 \r\rNot Spirits, yet to Heavenly Spirits bright \rLittle inferior; whom my thoughts pursue \rWith wonder, and could love, so lively shines \rIn them divine resemblance, and such grace \rThe hand that formed them on their shape hath poured. \rAh \\ gentle pair, ye little think how nigh \rYour change approaches, when all these delights \rWill vanish, and deliver ye to woe \rMore woe, the more your taste is now of joy : \rHappy, but for so happy ill secured 370 \r\rLong to continue, and this high seat, your Heaven, \r111 fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe \rAs now is entered; yet no purposed foe \rTo you, whom I could pity thus forlorn, \rThough I unpitied. League with you I seek, \rAnd mutual amity, so strait, so close, \rThat I with you must dwell, or you with me, \rHenceforth: my dwelling, haply, may not please, \rLike this fair Paradise, your sense ; yet such \rAccept your Maker\'s work; he gave it me, 380 \r\rWhich I as freely give. Hell shall unfold, \rTo entertain you two, her widest gates, \rAnd send forth all her kings; there will be room, \rNot like these narrow limits, to receive \rYour numerous offspring; if no better place, \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. Ill \r\rThank him who puts me loath to this revenge \r\rOn you who wrong me not, for him who wronged. \r\rAnd, should I at your harmless innocence \r\rMelt, as I do, yet public reason just \r\rHonour and empire with revenge enlarged 390 \r\rBy conquering this new World compels me now \r\rTo do what else, though damned, I should abhor." \r\rSo spake the Fiend, and with necessity, \rThe tyrant\'s plea, excused his devilish deeds. \rThen from his lofty stand on that high tree \rDown he alights among the sportful herd \rOf those four-footed kinds, himself now one, \rNow other, as their shape served best his end \rNearer to view his prey, and unespied \rTo mark what of their state he more might learn 400 \rBy word or action marked. About them round \rA lion now he stalks with fiery glare; \rThen as a tiger, who by chance hath spied \rIn some purlieu two gentle fawns at play, \rStraight couches . close ; then, rising, changes oft \rHis couchant watch, as one who chose his ground, \rWhence rushing he might surest seize them both, \rGriped in each paw : when Adam, first of men, \rTo first of women, Eve, thus moving speech, \rTurned him all ear to hear new utterance flow: 410 \r\r"Sole partner and sole part of all these joys, \r^Dearer thyself than all, needs must the Power \rThat made us, and for us this ample World, \rBe infinitely good, and of his good \rAs liberal and free as infinite; \r\' That raised us from the dust, and placed us here \r^n all this happiness, who at his hand \rHave nothing merited, nor can perform \r\r\r\r112 PARADISE LOST. \r\rAught whereof he hath need; he who requires \r\rFrom us no other service than to keep 420 \r\rThis one, this easy charge of all the trees \r\rIn Paradise that bear delicious fruit \r\rSo various, not to taste that only Tree \r\rOf Knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life; \r\rSo near grows death to life, whate\'er death is ; \r^ Some dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou know\'st \r\rGod hath pronounced it death to taste that Tree \r\rThe only sign of our obedience left \r\rAmong so many signs of power and rule \r\rConferred upon us, and dominion given 430 \r\rOver all other creatures that possess \r\rEarth, air, and sea. Then let us not think hard \r\rOne easy prohibition, who enjoy \r\rFree leave so large to all things else, and choice \r\rUnlimited of manifold delights; \r\rBut let us ever praise him, and extol \r\rHis bounty, following our delightful task, \r\rTo prune these growing plants, and tend these flowers ; \r\rWhich, were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet." \rf To whom thus Eve replied: "O thou for whom 440 \r\rAnd from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh, \r\rAnd without whom am to no end, my guide \r\rAnd head ! what thou hast said is just and right. \r\rFor we to him indeed all praises owe, \r\rAnd daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy \r\rSo far the happier lot, enjoying thee \r\rPre-eminent by so much odds, while thou \r\rLike consort to thyself canst nowhere find. \r\rThat day I oft remember, when from sleep \r\rI first awaked, and found myself reposed 450 \r\rUnder a shade on flowers, much wondering where \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. 113 \r\rAnd what I was, whence thither brought, and how. \rNot distant far from thence a murmuring sound \rOf waters issued from a cave, and spread \rInto a liquid plain ; then stood unmoved, \rPure as the expanse of Heaven. I thither went \rWith unexperienced thought, and laid me down \rOn the green bank, to look into the clear \rr Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky. \r, As I bent down to look, just opposite 460 \r\r\\A shape within the watery gleam appeared, \rBending to look on me : I started back, \rIt started back; but pleased I soon returned, \rPleased it returned as soon with answering looks \rOf sympathy and love. There I had fixed \rMine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire, \rHad not a voice thus warned me : \' What thou seest, \rWhat there thou seest, fair creature, is thyself; \rWith thee it came and goes : but follow me, \rAnd I will bring thee where no shadow stays 470 \r\rThy coming, and thy soft embraces he \rWhose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy \rInseparably thine; to him shalt bear \rMultitudes like thyself, and thence be called \rMother of human race.\' What could I do \rBut follow straight, invisibly thus led? \rTill I espied thee, fair indeed and tall, \rUnder a platane; yet methought less fair, \rLess winning soft, less amiably mild, \rThan that smooth watery image. Back I turned; 480 \rThou, following, cried\'st aloud, \'Return, fair Eve; \rWhom fliest thou? whom thou fliest, of him thou art, \rHis flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent \rOut of my side to thee, nearest my heart, \r\rp. L. 8 \r\r\r\r114 PARADISE LOST. \r\rSubstantial life, to have thee by my side \r\rHenceforth an individual solace dear : \r\rPart of my soul, I seek thee, and thee claim \r\rMy other half.\' With that thy gentle hand \r\rSeized mine: I yielded; and from that time see \r\rHow beauty is excelled by manly grace 490 \r\rAnd wisdom, which alone is truly fair." \r\rSo spake our general mother, and with eyes \rOf conjugal attraction unreproved, \rAnd meek surrender, half-embracing leaned \rOn our first father; half her swelling breast \rNaked met his, under the flowing gold \rOf her loose tresses hid. He, in delight \rBoth of her beauty and submissive charms, \r\rmiled with superior love, as Jupiter \rOn Juno smiles when he impregns the clouds 500 \r\rThat shed May flowers, and pressed her matron lip \r\rith kisses pure. Aside the Devil turned \rFor envy; yet with jealous leer malign \rEyed them askance, and to himself thirs plained : \r, " Sight hateful, sight tormenting ! thus these two, \r\\Imparadised in one another\'s arms, \rThe happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill \riDf bliss on bliss ; while I to Hell am thrust, \rWhere neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, \rAmong our other torments not the least, 510 \r\rStill unfulfilled, with pain of longing pines. \rYet let me not forget what I have gained \rFrom their own mouths. All is not theirs, it seems; \rOne fatal tree there stands, of Knowledge called, \rForbidden them to taste. Knowledge forbidden? \rSuspicious, reasonless ! why should their Lord \rEnvy them that? can it be sin to know? \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. 115 \r\rCan it be death? and do they only stand \rBy ignorance? is that their happy state, \rThe proof of their obedience and their faith? 520 \r\rO fair foundation laid whereon to build \rTheir ruin ! Hence I will excite their minds \rWith more desire to know, and to reject \rEnvious commands, invented with design \rTo keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt \rEqual with gods. Aspiring to be such, \rXhey taste and fle i what like.lip.r. can ensue? :&-ei^H \rBut first with narrow search I must walk round \rThis garden, and no corner leave unspied; \rA chance but chance may lead where I may meet 530 \rSome wandering Spirit of Heaven, by fountain-side, \rOr in thick shade retired, from him to draw \rWhat further would be learned. Live while ye may, \rYet happy pair; enjoy, till I return, \rShort pleasures; for long woes are to succeed." \rSo saying, his proud step he scornful turned, \rBut with sly circumspection, and began \rThrough wood, through waste, o\'er hill, o\'er dale, his roam. \rMeanwhile in utmost longitude, where Heaven \rWith Earth and Ocean meets, the setting sun 540 \r\rSlowly descended, and with right aspect \rAgainst the eastern gate of Paradise \rLevelled his evening rays. It was a rock \rOf alabaster, piled up to the clouds, \rConspicuous far, winding with one ascent \rAccessible from Earth, one entrance high; \rThe rest was craggy cliff, that overhung \rStill as it rose, impossible to climb. \rBetwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat, \rChief of the angelic guards, awaiting night; 550 \r\r82 \r\r\r\rIl6 PARADISE LOST. \r\rAbout him exercised heroic games \r\rThe unarmed youth of Heaven ; but nigh at hand \r\rCelestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears, \r\rHung high, with diamond flaming and with gold. \r\rThither came Uriel, gliding through the even \r\rOn a sunbeam, swift as a shooting star \r\rIn autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired \r\rImpress the air, and shows the mariner \r\rFrom what point of his compass to beware \r\rImpetuous winds. He thus began in haste: 560 \r\r"Gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath given \rCharge and strict watch, that to this happy place \rNo evil thing approach or enter in. \rThis day at highth of noon came to my sphere \rA Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know \rMore of the Almighty\'s works, and chiefly Man, \rGod\'s latest image. I described his way \rBent all on speed, and marked his aery gait; \r, But in the mount that lies from Eden north, \rWhere he first lighted, soon discerned his looks 570 \r\rAlien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured. \r,Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade \rLost sight of him. One of the banished crew, \rI fear, hath ventured from the Deep, to raise \rNew troubles; him thy care must be to find." \rTo whom the winged warrior thus returned: \r" Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight, \rAmid the Sun\'s bright circle where thou sitt\'st, \rSee far and wide. In at this gate none pass \rThe vigilance here placed, but such as come 580 \r\rWell-known from Heaven; and since meridian hour \rNo creature thence. If Spirit of other sort, \rSo minded, have o\'erleaped these earthy bounds \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. 117 \r\rOn purpose, hard thou know\'st it to exclude \r\rSpiritual substance with corporeal bar. \r\rBut if within the circuit of these walks, \r\rIn whatsoever shape, he lurk of whom \r\rThou tell\'st, by morrow dawning I shall know." \r\rSo promised he; and Uriel to his charge \rReturned on that bright beam, whose point now raised 590 \rBore him slope downward to the sun, now fallen \rBeneath the Azores ; whether the prime orb, \rIncredible how swift, had thither rolled \rDiurnal, or this less volubil Earth, \rBy shorter flight to the east, had left him there, \rArraying with reflected purple and gold \rThe clouds that on his western throne attend. \r\rNow came still Evening on, and Twilight gray \rHad in her sober livery all things clad ; \rSilence accompanied; for beast and bird, 600 \r\rThey to their grassy couch, these to their nests, \rWere slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale; \rShe all night long her amorous descant sung : \rSilence was pleased. Now glowed the firmament \rWith living sapphires; Hesperus, that led \rThe starry host, rode brightest, till the Moon, \rRising in clouded majesty, at length \rApparent queen, unveiled her peerless light, \rAnd o\'er the dark her silver mantle threw ; \rWhen Adam thus to Eve : " Fair consort, the hour 610 \rOf night, and all things now retired to rest, \rMind us of like repose, since God hath set \rLabour and rest, as day and night, to men \rSuccessive; and the timely dew of sleep, \rNow falling with soft slumberous weight, inclines \rOur eye-lids. Other creatures all day long \r\r\r\rIl8 PARADISE LOST. \r\rRove idle, unemployed, and less need rest; \r\rMan hath his daily work of body or mind \r\rAppointed, which declares his dignity, \r\rAnd the regard of Heaven on all his ways; 620 \r\rWhile other animals unactive range, \r\rAnd of their doings God takes no account. \r\rTo-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east \r\rWith first approach of light, we must be risen, \r\rAnd at our pleasant labour, to reform \r\rYon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green, \r\rOur walk at noon, with branches overgrown, \r\rThat mock our scant manuring, and require \r\rMore hands than ours to lop their wanton growth. \r\rThose blossoms also, and those dropping gums, 63* \r\rThat lie bestrewn, unsightly and unsmooth, \r\rAsk riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; \r\rMeanwhile, as Nature wills, night bids us rest." \r\rTo whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorned : \rf* 1 My author and disposer, what thou bidd\'st \rc i Unargued I obey ; so God ordains : \r\\God is thy law, thou mine : to know no more \r15s woman\'s happiest knowledge, and her praise. \rWith thee conversing I forget all time, \rAll seasons and their change: all please alike. 640 \r\rSweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet, \rWith charm of earliest birds; pleasant the Sun, \rWhen first on this delightful land he spreads \rHis orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower, \rGlistering with dew; fragrant the fertile Earth \rAfter soft showers ; and sweet the coming-on \rOf grateful Evening mild ; then silent Night, \rWith this her solemn bird, and this fair Moon, \rAnd these the gems of Heaven, her starry train: \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. IIQ \r\rBut neither breath of Morn, when she ascends 650 \r\rWith charm of earliest birds ; nor rising Sun \r\rOn this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower, \r\rGlistering with dew ; nor fragrance after showers ; \r\rNor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night, \r\rWith this her solemn bird; nor walk by moon, \r\rOr glittering star-light, without thee is sweet. \r\rBut wherefore all night long shine these? for whom \r\rThis glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?" \r\rTo whom our general ancestor replied : \r" Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve, 660 \r\rThose have their course to finish round the Earth \rBy morrow evening, and from land to land \rIn order, though to nations yet unborn, \rMinistering light prepared, they set and rise; \rLest total Darkness should by night regain \rHer old possession, and extinguish life \rIn nature and all things ; which these soft fires \rNot only enlighten, but with kindly heat \rOf various influence foment and warm, \rTemper or nourish, or in part shed down 670 \r\rTheir stellar virtue on all kinds that grow \rOn Earth, made hereby apter to receive \rPerfection from the sun\'s more potent ray. \rThese then, though unbeheld in deep of night, \rShine not in vain. Nor think, though men were none, \rThat Heaven would want spectators, God want praise. \rMillions of spiritual creatures walk the Earth \rUnseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep : \rAll these with ceaseless praise his works behold, \rBoth day and night. How often, from the steep 680 \rOf echoing hill or thicket, have we heard \rCelestial voices to the midnight air, \r\r\r\rI2O PARADISE LOST. \r\rSole, or responsive each to other\'s note, \rSinging their great Creator ! Oft in bands \rWhile they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk, \rWith heavenly touch of instrumental sounds \rIn full harmonic number joined, their songs \rDivide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven." \r\rf Thus talking, hand in hand alone they passed \r\r[jOn to their blissful bower. It was a place 690 \r\rChosen by the sovran Planter, when he framed \rAll things to Man\'s delightful use. The roof \rOf thickest covert was inwoven shade, \rLaurel and myrtle, and what higher grew \rOf firm and fragrant leaf; on either side \rAcanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub, \rFenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flower, \rIris all hues, roses, and jessamine, \r\rReared high their flourished heads between, and wrought \rMosaic; under-foot the violet, 700 \r\rCrocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay \rBroidered the ground, more coloured than with stone \rOf costliest emblem. Other creature here, \rBeast, bird, insect, or worm, durst enter none ; \rSuch was their awe of Man. In shadier bower \rMore sacred and sequestered, though but feigned, \rPan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nyjoph \rt Nor Fauntnr"riaunted. Here, in close recess, \r\\ With ^flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs \r\rI Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed, 710 \r\r\\ And Heavenly choirs the hymenaean sung, \r\rVwhat day the genial Angel to our sire \rv |B rough t her, in naked beauty more adorned, \r\riMore lovely, than Pandora, whom the gods \r\r(Endowed with all their gifts ; and, O ! too like \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. 121 \r\rIn sad event, when, to the unwiser son \rOf Japhet brought by Hermes~she ensnared \rMankind with her fair looks, to be avenged \rOn him who had stole Jove\'s authentic fire. \r\rThus at their shady lodge arrived, both stood, 720 \r\rBoth turned, and under open sky adored \rThe God that made both sky, air, Earth, and Heaven, \rWhich they beheld, the moon\'s resplendent globe, \rAnd starry pole : " Thou also madest the night, \r\rr Maker Omnipotent; and thou the day, \rWhich we, in our appointed work employed, \rHave finished, happy in our mutual help \rAnd mutual love, the crown of all our bliss \rOrdained by thee; and this delicious place, \rFor us too large, where thy abundance wants 730 \r\rPartakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. \rBut thou hast promised from us two a race \rTo fill the Earth, who shall with us extol \rThy goodness infinite, both when we wake, \rAnd when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep." \r\rThis said unanimous, and other rites \rObserving none but adoration pure, \rWhich God likes best, into their inmost bower \rHanded they went; and, eased the putting-off \rThese troublesome disguises which we wear, 740 \r\rStraight side by side were laid; nor turned, I ween, \r\rfAdam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the rites \r\ri Mysterious of connubial love refused : \rWhatever hypocrites austerely talk \rOf purity, and place, and innocence, \rDefaming as impure what God declares \rPure, and commands to some, leaves free to all. \rOur Maker bids increase; who bids abstain \r\r\r\r122 PARADISE LOST. \r\rBut our destroyer, foe to God and Man? \rT Hail, wedded Love, mysterious law, true source 750 \r\ru Of human offspring, sole propriety \rL In Paradise of all things common else ! \r\rfBy thee adulterous lust was driven from men \rAmong the bestial herds to range ; by thee, \r\r< Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure, \rRelations dear, and all the charities \rOf father, son, and brother, first were known. \rFar be it that I should write thee sin or blame, \rOr think thee unbefitting holiest place, \rPerpetual fountain of domestic sweets, 760 \r\rWhose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced, \rPresent or past, as saints and patriarchs used. \r\rjHere Love his golden shafts employs, here lights \rHis constant lamp, and waves his purple wings, \rReigns here and revels : not in the bought smile \r\rj Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared, \r\r\\ Casual fruition; nor in court-amours, \rMixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball, \rn Or serenate, which the starved lover sings \r\rTo his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. 770 \r\rThese, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept, \rAnd on their naked limbs the flowery roof \r\r[Showered roses, which the mom repaired. Sleep on, \rBlest pair ! and, O i yet happiest, if ye seek \rNo happier state, and know to know no more ! \r\rNow had night measured with her shadowy cone \rHalf-way up-hill this vast sublunar vault; \rAnd from their ivory port the Cherubim \rForth issuing, at the accustomed hour, stood armed \rTo their night-watches in warlike parade; 780 \r\rWhen Gabriel to his next in power thus spake: \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. \r\r" ..Uzziel, halfjthese dra^vjjff^and coast the south \rWith strictest watch; these other wheel the north: \rOur circuit meets full west." As flame they part, \rHalf wheeling to the shield, half to the spear. \rFrom these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called \rThat near him stood, and gave them thus in charge : \r\r"fchuriel and Zephon, with winged speed \rSearch through tins garden ; leave unsearched no nook ; \rBut chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge, 790 \r\rNow laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm. \rThis evening from the sun\'s decline arrived \rWho tells of some infernal Spirit seen \rHitherward bent (who could have thought?), escaped \rThe bars of Hell, on errand bad, no doubt: \rSuch, where ye find, seize fast, and hither bring." \r\rSo saying, on he led his radiant files, \rDazzling the moon ; these to the bower direct \rIn search of whom they sought. Him there they found \rSquat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve, 800 \r\rAssaying by his devilish art to reach \rThe organs of her fancy, and with them forge \rIllusions as he list, phantasms and dreams; \rOr if, inspiring venom, he might taint \rThe animal spirits, that from pure blood arise \rLike gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise \r_ At least distempered, discontented thoughts, J\\ \r\rVain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires, \r\' Blown up with high conceits engendering pridej) \r\rHim thus intent Ithuriel with his spear 810 \r\rTouched lightly; for no falsehood can endure \r\rTouch of celestial temper, but returns \r\rOf force to its own likeness : up he starts, \r\rDiscovered and surprised. As when a spark \r\r\r\r124 PARADISE LOST. \r\rLights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid \r\rFit for the tun, some magazine to store \r\rAgainst a rumoured war, the smutty grain, \r\rWith sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air: \r\rSo started up in his own shape the Fiend. \r\rBack stept those two fair Angels, half amazed 820 \r\rSo sudden to behold the grisly King; \r\rYet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon : \r\r"Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell \rCom\'st thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed, \rWhy sat\'st thou like an enemy in wait, \rHere watching at the head of these that sleep?" \r\r"Know ye not, then," said Satan, filled with scorn, \r"Know ye not me? Ye knew me once no mate \rFor you, there sitting where ye durst not soar ! \rNot to know me argues yourselves unknown, 830 \r\rThe lowest of your throng ; or if ye know, \rWhy ask ye, and superfluous begin \rYour message, like to end as much in vain?" \r\rTo whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn : \r"Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, \rOr undiminished brightness, to be known \rAs when thou stood\'st in Heaven upright and pure. \rThat glory then, when thou no more wast good, \rDeparted from thee; and thou resemblest now \rThy sin and place of doom obscure and foul. 840 \r\rBut come; for thou, be sure, shalt give account \rTo him who sent us, whose charge is to keep \rThis place inviolable, and these from harm." \r\rSo spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke, \rSevere in youthful beauty, added grace \rInvincible. Abashed the Devil stood, \ri And felt how awful goodness is, and saw \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. 125 \r\rVirtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined \r\rHis loss; but chiefly to find here observed \r\rHis lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed 50 \r\rUndaunted. " If I must contend, 5 \' said he, \r\r"Best with the best the sender, not the sent; \r\rOr all at once : more glory will be won, \r\rOr less be lost." "Thy fear," said Zephon bold, \r\r"Will save us trial what the least can do \r\rSingle against thee, wicked and thence weak." \r\rThe Fiend replied not, overcome with rage; \rBut, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on, \rChamping his iron curb : to strive or fly \rHe held it vain; awe from above had quelled 860 \r\rHis heart, not else dismayed. Now drew they nigh \rThe western point, where those half-rounding guards \rJust met, and closing stood in squadron joined, \rAwaiting next command. To whom their chief, \rGabriel, from the front thus called aloud : \r\r"O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet \rHasting this way, and now by glimpse discern \rIthuriel and Zephon through the shade; \rAnd with them comes a third, of regal port, \rBut faded splendour wan, who by his gait 870 \r\rAnd fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell; \rNot likely to part hence without contest. \rStand firm, for in his look, defiance lours." \r\rHe scarce had ended, when those two approached, \rAnd brief related whom they brought, where found, \rHow busied, in what form and posture couched. \rTo whom, with stern regard, thus Gabriel spake : \r"Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed \rTo thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge \rOf others, who approve not to transgress 880 \r\r\r\r126 PARADISE LOST. \r\rBy thy example, but have power and right \rTo question thy bold entrance on this place? \rEmployed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those \rWhose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss." \r\rTo whom thus Satan, with contemptuous brow : \r"Gabriel, thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise, \rAnd such I held thee; but this question asked \rPuts me in doubt. Lives there who loves his pain? \rWho would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, \rThough thither doomed? Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt, 890 \rAnd boldly venture to whatever place \rFarthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change \rTorment with ease, and soonest recompense \rDole with delight ; which in this place I sought : \rTo thee no reason, who know\'st only good, \rBut evil hast not tried. And wilt object \rHis will who bound us? let him surer bar \rHis iron gates, if he intends our stay \rIn that dark durance. Thus much what was asked : \rThe rest is true, they found me where they say; 900 \rBut that implies not violence or harm." \r\rThus he in scorn. The warlike Angel moved, \rDisdainfully half smiling, thus replied : \r"O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise, \rSince Satan fell, whom folly overthrew, \rAnd now returns him from his prison scaped, \rGravely in doubt whether to hold them wise \rOr not who ask what boldness brought him hither \rUnlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed ! \rSo wise he judges it to fly from pain 910 \r\rHowever, and to scape his punishment ! \rSo judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrath, \rWhich thou incurr\'st by flying, meet thy flight \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. 127 \r\rSevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, \r\rWhich taught thee yet no better, that no pain \r\rCan equal anger infinite provoked. \r\rBut wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee \r\rCame not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them \r\rLess pain, less to be fled? or thou than they \r\rLess hardy to endure? Courageous chief, 920 \r\rThe first in flight from pain, hadst thou alleged \r\rTo thy deserted host this cause of flight, \r\rThou surely hadst not come sole fugitive." \r\rTo which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern: \r"Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, \rInsulting Angel ! well thou know\'st I stood \rThy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid \rThe blasting vollied thunder made all speed, \rAnd seconded thy else not dreaded spear. \rBut still thy words at random, as before, 930 \r\rArgue thy inexperience what behoves, \rFrom hard assays and ill successes past, \rA faithful leader; not to hazard all \rThrough ways of danger by himself untried. \rI therefore, I alone, first undertook \rTo wing the desolate Abyss, and spy \rThis new-created World, whereof in Hell \rFame is not silent; here in hope to find \rBetter abode, and my afflicted powers \rTo settle here on Earth, or in mid air; 940 \r\rThough for possession put to try once more \rWhat thou and thy gay legions dare against; \rWhose easier business were to serve their Lord \rHigh up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne, \rAnd practised distances to cringe, not fight." \r\r\r\r128 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTo whom the warrior Angel soon replied: \r"To say and straight unsay, pretending first \rWise to fly pain, professing next the spy, \rArgues no leader, but a liar traced, \r\rSatan; and couldst thou \'faithful\' add? O name, 950 \rO sacred name of faithfulness profaned ! \r\rFaithful fn whnm?^. ri, y m^nlHmm ^r fw j> \r\rArmy of fiends, fit body to fit head, \r\rWas this your discipline and faith engaged, \r\rYour military obedience, to dissolve \r\rAllegiance to the acknowledged Power Supreme? \r\rAnd thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem \r\rPatron of liberty, who more than thou \r\rOnce fawned, and cringed, and servilely adored \r\rHeaven\'s awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope 960 \r\rTo dispossess him, and thyself to reign? \r\rBut mark what I areed thee now : Avaunt ! \r\rFly thither whence thou fledst. If from this hour \r\rWithin these hallowed limits thou appear, \r\rBack to the infernal pit I drag thee chained, \r\rAnd seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn \r\rThe facile gates of Hell too slightly barred." \r\rSo threatened he; but Satan to no threats \rGave heed, but waxing more in rage replied : \r\r"Then, when I am thy captive, talk of chains, 970 \rProud limitary Cherub ! but ere then \rFar heavier load thyself expect to feel \rFrom my prevailing arm, though Heaven\'s King \rRide on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers, \rUsed to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels \rIn progress through the road of Heaven star-paved." \r\rWhile thus he spake, the angelic squadron bright \r\r\r\rBOOK IV. 129 \r\rTurned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns \r\rTheir_ phalanx, and began to hem him round \r\rWith p7>rtecT"s"pears, as thick as when a field 980 \r\rOf Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends \r\rHer bearded grove of ears which way the wind \r\rSways them; the careful ploughman doubting stands \r\rLest on the threshing-floor his hopeful sheaves \r\rProve chaff. On the other side, Satan, alarmed, \r\rCollecting all his might, dilated stood, \r\rLike TenerirT or Atlas, unremoved : \r\rHis stature reached the sky, and grxJiis.. crest \r\rSat Horror plumed ; nor wanted in his grasp \r\rWhat seemed both spear and shield. Now dreadful deeds 990 \r\rMight have ensued: nor only Paradise, \r\rIn this commotion, but the starry cope \r\rOf Heaven perhaps, or all the elements \r\rAt least, had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn \r\rWith violence of this conflict, had not soon \r\rThe Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray, \r\rHung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen \r\rBetwixt Astraea and the Scorpion sign, \r\rWherein all things created first he weighed, \r\rThe pendulous round Earth with balanced air IOOG \r\rIn counterpoise now ponders all events, \r\rBattles and realms. In these he put two weights, \r\rThe sequel each of parting and of fight : \r\rThe latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam; \r\rWhich Gabriel spying thus bespake the Fiend : \r\r" Satan, I know thy strength, and thou know\'st mine ; \r1 Neither our own, but given ; what folly then \rI To boast what arms can do ! since thine no more \r\'Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now \r\r\r\rp. L. \r\r\r\r130 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTo trample thee as mire. For proof look up, 1010 \r\rAnd read thy lot in yon celestial sign, \r\rWhere thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak \r\rIf thou resist." The Fiend looked up, and knew \r\rHis mounted scale aloft : nor more ; but fled \r\rMurmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. \r\r\r\rBOOK V. \r\r\r\r92 \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\r\r\rMorning approached, Eve relates to Adam her troublesome dream ; \rhe likes it not, yet comforts her : they come forth to their day labours : \rtheir morning hymn at the door of their bower. CGod, to render Man \rinexcusable, sends Raphael to admonish him of his obedience, of his \rfree estate, of his enemy near at hand who he is, and why his enemy, \rand whatever else may avail Adam to know v Raphael comes down to \rParadise ; his appearance described ; his coming discerned by Adam \rafar off, sitting at the door of his bower; he goes out to meet him, \rbrings him to his lodge, entertains him with the choicest fruits of \rParadise got together by Eve ; their discourse at table. Raphael \rperforms his message, minds Adam of his state and of his enemy ; \rrelates, at Adam\'s request, who that enemy is, and how he came to be \rso, beginning from his first revolt in Heaven, and the occasion thereof; \rhow he drew his legions after him to the parts of the North, and there \rincited them to rebel with him, persuading all but only Abdiel, a Seraph, \rwho in argument dissuades and opposes him, then forsakes him. \r\r\r\rBOOK V. \r\r\r\rNOW Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime \rAdvancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl, \rWhen Adam waked, so customed ; for his sleep \rWas aery light, from pure digestion bred, \rAnd temperate vapours bland, which the only sound \rOf leaves and fuming rills, Aurora\'s fan, \rLightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song \rOf birds on every bough ; so much the more \rHis wonder was to find unwakened Eve \rWith tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek, \rj~As through unquiet rest. He, on his side \r\\ Leaning half-raised, with looks of cordial love \rHung over her enamoured, and beheld \rBeauty, which, whether waking or asleep, \r^ LShot forth peculiar graces; then, with voice \rMild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes, \rHer hand soft touching, whispered thus : " Awake, \rMy fairest, my espoused, my latest found, \rHeaven\'s last, best gift, my ever-new delight ! \rAwake ! the morning shines, and the fresh field \rCalls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring \rOur tended plants, how blows the citron grove, \r\r\r\r10 \r\r\r\r20 \r\r\r\r1 \r\r\r\r134 PARADISE LOST. \r\rWhat drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed, \rHow Nature paints her colours, how the bee \rSits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet." \r\rSuch whispering waked her, but with startled eye \rOn Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake : \r[~ "O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, \rMy glory, my perfection ! glad I see \rThy face, and morn returned; for I this night 30 \r\r(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed, \rIf dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee, \rWorks of day past, or morrow\'s next design, \rBut of offence and trouble, which my mind \rKnew never till this irksome night. Methought, \rClose at mine ear one called me forth to walk \rWith gentle voice; I thought it thine. It said, \r\'Why sleep\'st thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time, \rThe cool, the silent, save where silence yields \rTo the night- warbling bird, that now awake 40 \r\rTunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns \rFull-orbed the moon, and, with more pleasing light, \rShadowy sets off the face of things in vain, \rIf none regard. Heaven wakes with all his eyes, \rWhom to behold but thee, Nature\'s desire, \rIn whose sight all things joy, with ravishment \rAttracted by thy beauty still to gaze?\' \rI rose as at thy call, but found thee not: \rTo find thee I directed then my walk ; \rAnd on, methought, alone I passed through ways 50 \r\rThat brought me on a sudden to the Tree """x. \rOf interdicted Knowledge. Fair it seemed, ) \r\rMuch fairer to my fancy than by day; \rAnd, as I wondering looked, beside it stood \rOne shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven \r\r\r\rBOOK V. 135 \r\r3y us oft seen : his dewy locks distilled \rAmbrosia. On that Tree he also gazed; \rAnd, \'O fair plant,\' said he, \'with fruit surcharged, \rDeigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet, \r\rr god, nor man? Is knowledge so despised? 60 \r\r)r envy, or what reserve forbids to taste? \r\rbrbid who will, \'none shall from me withhold \r\rConger thy offered good, why else set here?\' \r\':fhis said, he paused not, but with venturous arm \rtie plucked, he tasted. Me damp horror chilled \rAe* such bold words vouched with a deed so bold ; \rBut he thus, overjoyed : \' O fruit divine, \rSweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropped, \rForbidden here, it seems, as only fit \rFor gods, yet able to make gods of men ! 70 \r\rAnd why not gods of men, since good, the more \rCommunicated, more abundant grows, \rThe author not impaired, but honoured more? \rHere, happy creature, fair angelic Eve, \rPartake thou also : happy though thou art, \rHappier thou may\'st be, worthier canst not be ; \rTaste this, and be henceforth among the gods \rThyself a goddess ; not to Earth confined, \rBut sometimes in the Air, as we; sometimes \rAscend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see So \r\rWhat life the gods live there, and such live \rSo saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, \rEven to my mouth of that same fruit held part \rWhich he had plucked ; the pleasant savoury smell \rSo quickened appetite that I, methought, \rCould not but taste. Forthwith up to the clouds \rWith him I flew, and underneath beheld \rThe Earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide \r\r\r\r136 PARADISE LOST. \r\rAnd various : wondering at my flight and change \rTo this high exaltation, suddenly 90 \r\rMy guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down, \rAnd fell asleep ; but, O, how glad I waked \rTo find this but a dream !" Thus Eve her night \rJ Related, and thus Adam answered sad: \rV" " Best image of myself, and dearer half, \r^The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep \r" ^Affects me equally; nor can I like \r\rThis uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear; \rYet evil whence ? in thee can harbour none, \r\r\r\r< \r\r. i/t \r-Created pure. But know that in the soul 100 \r\rAre many lesser faculties, that serve \rReason as chief; among these Fancy next \rHer office holds ; of all external things, \rWhich the five watchful senses represent, \rShe forms imaginations, aery shapes, \rWhich Reason, joining or disjoining, frames \rAll what we affirm or what deny, and call \rOur knowledge or opinion; then retires \rInto her private cell when Nature rests. \rOft in her absence mimic Fancy wakes no \r\rTo imitate her; but, misjoining shapes, \rWild work produces oft, and most in dreams, \r111 matching words and deeds long past or late. \r..Some such resemblances, methinks, I find \r* ! Of our last evening\'s talk in this thy dream, \r^"But with addition strange; yet be not sad: \rEvil into the mind of god or man \rMay come and go, so unapproved, and leave \rNo spot or blame behind; which gives me hope \rThat what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream, 120 \r\rWaking thou never wilt consent to do. \r\r\r\r\r\r\rBOOK V. 137 \r\rBe not disheartened, then, nor cloud those looks, \rThat wont to be more cheerful and serene \rThan when fair Morning first smiles on the world ; \rAnd let us to our fresh employments rise \rAmong the groves, the fountains, and the flowers, \rThat open now their choicest bosomed smells, \rReserved from night, and kept for thee in store." \r\' So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered, \rBut silently a gentle tear let fall 130 \r\rFrom either eye, and wiped them with her hair; \rTwo other precious drops that ready stood, \rEach in their crystal sluice, he, ere they fell, \r) Kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse \ri And pious awe, that feared to have offended. \r\rSo all was cleared, and to the field they haste. \rBut first, from under shady arborous roof \rSoon as they forth were come to open sight \rOf day-spring, and the sun who, scarce uprisen, \rWith wheels yet hovering o\'er the ocean-brim, 140 \r\rShot parallel to the Earth his dewy ray, \rDiscovering in wide landskip all the east \r-> <: > Of Paradise and Eden\'s happy plains \rLowly they bowed adoring, and began \rTheir orisons, each morning duly paid \rIn various style; for neither various style \rNor holy rapture wanted they to praise \rTheir Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung \rUnmeditated ; such prompt eloquence \rFlowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse, 150 \rMore tuneable than needed lute or harp \rTo add more sweetness : and they thus began : \r\r"These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, \rAlmighty! thine this universal frame, \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. \r\rThus wondrous fair : thyself how wondrous then ! \rUnspeakable ! who sitt\'st above these Heavens \r\rKTo us invisible, or dimly seen \rIn these thy lowest works; yet these declare \rThy goodness beyond thought, and power oliyiae. \rSneak, ye who best can tell, ye Sons of \'Cjght, 160 \r\rAngels, for ye behold him, and with v songs \rAnd ^choral symphonies^ clay without night, v \rCircle his throne rejoicing ye in Heaven; \rOn Earthjoin, all ye creatures, to extol \rHim first, hii_ last, him piidst, and without end. \rFairest_pf(^arsjlast in the train of nightT~T~" \rIf better thou belong^iot/To the^-d \rSure pledge oFclay, th^c crown\'sTtKe smiling M< \rWith thy brighrliirclSt, praise him in thj \r\rrisjsrthat sweet hour (^fjprime. 170 \r\r^ _ if this great world both eye and soul, \r\rAcknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise \r\rIn thy eternaljcourse, both when thou< \r\rAnd wher/tiigri noon) hast gained, a.n.cl^when tboujall\'st?

This let him know, \rLest wilfully transgressing he pretend \rSurprisal, unadmonished, unfore warned." \r\rSo spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled \rAll justice; nor delayed the winged Saint \rAfter his charge received; but from among \rThousand celestial Ardours, where he stood \rVeiled with his gorgeous wings, upspringing light, 250 \rFlew through the midst of Heaven ; the angelic quires, \rOn each hand parting, to his speed gave way \rThrough all the empyreal road, till, at the gate \r\r\r\rBOOK V. I4I \r\rOf Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide, \r\rOn golden hinges turning, as by work \r\rDivine the sovran Architect had framed. \r\rFrom hence no cloud or, to obstruct his sight, \r\rStar interposed, however small he sees, \r\rNot unconform to other shining globes, \r\rEarth, and the Garden* of God, with cedars crowned 260 \r\rAbove ^11 hills ; as when by. night -the_glass- \r\rOf Galileo, less assured^" observes \r\rImagined lands and regions in the moon; \r\rQr_pi,lo from amidst the Cyclades \r\rDelos or Samos first appearing kens, \r\rA cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight \r\rHe speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky \r\rSails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing \r\rNow on the polar winds ; then with quick fan \r\rWinnows the buxom air, till, within soar 270 \r\rOf towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems \r\rA phcenix gazed by all, as that sole bird, \r\rWhen, to enshrine his re-liques in the Sun\'s \r\rBright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies. \r\rAt once on the eastern cliff of Paradise \r\rHe lights, and to his proper shape returns, \r\rA Seraph winged. Six wings he wore, to shade \r\rHis lineaments divine : the pair that clad \r\rEach shoulder broad came mantling o\'er his breast \r\rWith regal ornament; the middle pair 280 \r\rGirt like a starry zone his waist, and round \r\rSkirted his loins and thighs with downy gold \r\rAnd colours dipt in heaven; the third his feet \r\rShadowed from either heel with feathered mail, \r\rSky-tinctured grain. Like Maia\'s son he stood, \r\rAnd shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled \r\r\r\r142 PARADISE LOST. \r\rThe circuit wide. Straight knew him all the bands \r\rOf Angels under watch; and to his state \r\rAnd to his message high in honour rise ; \r\rFor on some message high they guessed him bound. 290 \r\rTheir glittering tents he passed, and now is .come \r\rInto the blissful field, through groves of myrrh, \r\rAnd flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm, \r\rA wilderness of sweets ; for Nature here \r\rWantoned as in her prime, and played at will \r\rHer virgin fancies, pouring forth more sweet, \r\rWild above rule or art, enormous bliss. \r\rHim, through the spicy forest onward come, \r\r/Adam discerned, as in the door he sat \r\r| Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun 300 \r\r: Shot down direct his fervid rays, to warm \rEarth\'s inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs ; \rAnd Eve within, due at her hour, prepared \r\ri^or dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please \rTrue appetite, and not disrelish thirst \rOf nectarous draughts between, from milky stream, \rBerry or grape : to whom thus Adam called : \r\r"Haste hither, Eve, and, worth thy sight, behold \rEastward among those trees what glorious shape \rComes this way moving; seems another morn ^$* 310 \rRisen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven \r\ro us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe \rThis day to be our guest. But go with speed, \rAnd what thy stores contain bring forth, and pour \rAbundance, fit to honour and receive \r* I. Our heavenly stranger; well we may afford \rOur givers their own gifts, and large bestow \rFrom large bestowed, where Nature multiplies \rHer fertile growth, and by disburdening grows \r\r\r\rBOOK V. 143 \r\rMore fruitful ; which instructs us not to spare." 320 \r\rTo whom thus Eve : " Adam, Earth\'s hallowed mould, \rOf God inspired, small store will serve where store, \rAll seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; \rSave what by frugal storing firmness gains \rTo nourish, and superfluous moist consumes. \r\r\' But I will haste, and from each bough and brake, \r\rEach plant and juiciest gourd, will pluck such choice \r.g. 1 To entertain our Angel-guest, as he \r\rBeholding shall confess that here on Earth \r\r\' JGod hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven." 330 \r\rSo saying, with dispatchful looks in haste \r\rf She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent, \rWhat choice to choose for delicacy best, \r\rI What order, so contrived as not to mix \rTastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring \rTaste after taste upheld with kindliest change : \rBestirs her then, and from each tender stalk \rWhatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields \r\r/ In India-East or West, .or middle shore, \r\rVln Pgntus^or the ^unic coast, or where 340 \r\rAlcinpus. reigned, fxtUt^CSTkinds, in coat \r.Rough or smooth-rined, or bearded husk, or shell, \rShe gathers, tribute large, and on the board \rHeaps with unsparing hand. For drink the grape \rShe crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths \rFrom many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed \rShe tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold \rWants her fit vessels pure; then strews the ground \rWith rose and odours from the shrub unfumed. \r\rMeanwhile our primitive great Sire, to meet 350 \r\rHis godlike guest, walks forth, without more train \rAccompanied than with his own complete \r\r\r\r144 PARADISE LOST. \r\rPerfections ; in himself was all his state, \r\rMore solemn than the tedious pomp that waits \r\rOn princes, when their rich retinue long \r\rOf horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold, \r\rDazzles the crowd, and sets them all agape. \r\rNearer his presence, Adam, though not awed, \r\rYet with submiss approach and reverence meek, \r\rAs to a superior nature, bowing low, 360 \r\rThus said : " Native of Heaven (for other place \r\rNone can than Heaven such glorious shape contain), \r\rSince, by descending from the Thrones above, \r\rThose happy places thou hast deigned a while \r\rTo want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us, \r\rTwo only, who yet by sovran gift possess \r\rThis spacious ground, in yonder shady bower \r\rTo rest, and what the Garden choicest bears \r\rTo sit and taste, till this meridian heat \r\rBe over, and the sun more cool decline." 370 \r\rWhom thus the angelic Virtue answered mild : \r"Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such \rCreated, or such place hast here to dwell, \rAs may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven, \rTo visit thee; lead on, then, where thy bower \rO\'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise, \rI have at will." So tq^the-syrvan lodge \rThey came, that like Pomona\'s arbour smiled, \rWith flowerets decked and fragrant smells; but Eve, \rUndecked save with herself, more lovely fair 380 \r\rThan wood-nymph, or the fairest goddess feigned \rOf three that in Mount Ida naked strove, \rStood to entertain her guest from Heaven ; no veil \rShe needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm \rAltered her cheek. On whom the Angel "Hail!" \r\r\r\rBOOK V. 145 \r\rBestowed, the holy salutation used \rLong after to blest Mary, second Eve: \rr" " Hail ! Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb \r\rShall fill the world more numerous with thy sons \r! Than with these various fruits the trees of God 390 \r\rI Have heaped this table ! " Raised of grassy turf \rTheir table was, and mossy seats had round, \rAnd on her ample square from side to side \rAll autumn piled, though spring and autumn here \rDanced hand-in-hand. A while discourse they hold \rNo fear lest dinner cool when thus began \rOur Author: "Heavenly stranger, please to taste \rThese bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom \rAll perfect good, unmeasured-out, descends, \rTo us for food and for delight hath caused 400 \r\rThe Earth to yield : unsavoury food, perhaps, \rTo spiritual natures; only this I know, \r\'That one celestial Father gives to all." \r\rTo whom the Angel : " Therefore, what he gives \r(Whose praise be ever Sung) to Man, in part \rSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be found \rNo ingrateful food : and food alike those pure \rIntelligential substances require \rAs doth your rational; and both contain \rWithin them every lower faculty 410 \r\rOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, \rTasting concoct, digest, assimilate, \rAnd corporeal to incorporeal turn. \rFor know, whatever was created needs \rTo be sustained and fed; of elements \rThe grosser feeds the purer: earth the sea; \rEarth and the sea feed air; the air those fires \rEthereal, and, as lowest, first the moon; \r\rP. L. 10 \r\r\r\r146 PARADISE LOST. \r\rWhence in her visage round those spots, unpurged \r\rVapours not yet into her substance turned. 420 \r\rNor doth the moon no nourishment exhale \r\rFrom her moist continent to higher orbs. \r\rThe sun, that light imparts to all, receives \r\rFrom all his alimental recompense \r\rIn humid exhalations, and at even \r\rSups with the ocean. Though in Heaven the trees \r\rOf life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines \r\rYield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn \r\rWe brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground \r\rCovered with pearly grain; yet God hath here 430 \r\rVaried his bounty so with new delights \r\rAs may compare with Heaven; and to taste \r\rThink not I shall be nice." So down they sat, \r\rAnd to their viands fell; nor seemingly \r\rThe Angel, nor in mist the common gloss \r\rOf theologians but with keen dispatch \r\rOf real hunger, and concoctive heat \r\rTo transubstantiate : what redounds transpires \r\rThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder, if by fire \r\rOf sooty coal the empiric alchemist 440 \r\rCan turn, or holds it possible to turn, \r\rMetals of drossiest ore to perfect gold, \r\rfrom the mine. Meanwhile at table Eve \r\r[inistered naked, and their flowing cups \rWith pleasant liquors crowned. O innocence \r>eserving Paradise ! If ever, then, \rThen had the Sons of God excuse to have been \rEnamoured at that sight; but in those hearts \rLove unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy \rWas understood, the injured lover\'s hell. 450 \r\rThus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed, \r\r\r\rBOOK V. \r\r(Humaijrdened nature, sudden mind arose \r\rTo ^ m not to let the occasion pass, \rAttendhim by this great conference, to know \rThat t^gs above his world, and of their being \rThat dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw \rTb ans cend his own so far, whose radiant forms \rC\'ivine effulgence whose high power, so far \rExceeded human; and his wary speech \rThus to the empyreal minister he framed : 460 \r\r"Inhabitant with God, now know I well \rThy favour, in this honour done to Man, \rUnder whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed \rTo enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, \rFood not of Angels, yet accepted so, \rAs that more willingly thou couldst not seem \rAt Heaven\'s high feasts to have fed : yet what compare?" \r\rTo whom the winged Hierarch replied : \r"O Adam, one Almighty is, from whom \rAll things proceed, and up to him return, 470 \r\rIf not depraved from good, created all \rSuch to perfection, one first matter all, \rEndued with various forms, various degrees \rOf substance, and, in things that live, of life; \rBut more refined, more spiritous and pure, \rAs nearer to him placed or nearer tending, \rEach in their several active spheres assigned, \rTill body up to spirit work, in bounds \rProportioned to each kind. So from the root \rSprings lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves 480 \rMore aery, last the bright consummate flower \rSpirits odorous breathes : flowers and their fruit, \rMan\'s nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed, \rTo vital spirits aspire, to animal, \r\r\r\r10 2 \r\r\r\r148 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTo intellectual; give both life and sense, \r\rFancy and understanding; whence the soul 420 \r\rReason receives, and reason is her being, \r\rDiscursive, or intuitive : discourse \r\rIs oftest yours, the latter most is ours, \r\rDiffering but in degree, of kind the same. s \r\rWonder not, then, what God for you saw good \r\rIf I refuse not, but convert, as you, \r\rTo proper substance. Time may come when men \r\rWith Angels may participate, and find \r\rNo inconvenient diet, nor too light fare; \r\rAnd from these corporal nutriments, perhaps, \r\rYour bodies may at last turn all to spirit, \r\rImproved by tract of time, and winged ascend \r\rEthereal, as we; or may at choice \r\rHere or in heavenly Paradises dwell, 500 \r\rIf ye be found obedient, and retain \r\rUnalterably firm his love entire, \r\rWhose progeny you are. Meanwhile enjoy \r\rYour fill what happiness this happy state \r\rCan comprehend, incapable of more." \r\rTo whom the Patriarch of Mankind replied : \r"O favourable Spirit, propitious guest, \rWell hast thou taught the way that might direct \rOur knowledge, and the scale of Nature set \rFrom centre to circumference, whereon, 510 \r\rIn contemplation of created things, \rBy steps we may ascend to God. But say, \rWhat meant that caution joined, If ye be found \rr Obedient? Can we want oj^edience, then, \rTo him, or possibly his love desert, \rWho formed us from the dust, and placed us here \rFull to the utmost measure of what bliss \r\r\r\rBOOK V. IAQ \r\r(Human desires can seek or apprehend?" ^F \r\rTo whom the Angel : " Son of Heaven and Earth, \r\rAttend ! That thou art happy, owe to God ; 520 \r\rThat thou continuest such, owe to thyself, \r\rThat is, to thy obedience; therein stand: \r\rThis was that caution given thee; be advised^ \r\rGod made thee perfect, not immutable; \r\rAnd good he made thee, but to persevere^! \r\rHe left it in thy power ordained thy wilj \r\rBy nature free, not over-ruled by fate \r\rInextricable, or strict necessity. \r\rOur voluntary service he requires, \r\rNot our necessitated ; such with him \\ 530 \r\rFinds no acceptance, nor can find; for how \r\rCan hearts not free be tried whether they serve \r\rWilling or no, who will but what they must \r\rBy destiny, and can no other choose? \r\rMyself, and all the angelic host, that stand \r\rIn sight of God enthroned, our happy state \r\rHold, as you yours, while our obedience hole \rn other surety none : freely we serve, \r\rBecause we freely love, as in our will \r\rTo love or not; in this we stand or fall. 540 \r\r! And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen, \r\rAnd so from Heaven to deepest Hell: O fall \r, From what high state of bliss into what woe!" \rTo whom our great Progenitor: "Thy words \r\rAttentive, and with more delighted ear, \r\rDivine instructor, I have heard, than when \r\rCherubic songs by night from neighbouring hills \r\rAerial music send; nor knew I not \r\rTo be, both will and deed, created free. \rI Yet that we never shall forget to love 550 \r\r\r\r\r/ \r\r\r\r150 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOur Maker, and obey him whose command \r\rSingle is yet so just, my constant thoughts \r\rAssured me, and still assure; though what thou tell\'st \r\rHath passed in Heaven some doubt within me move, \r\rBut more desire to hear, if thou consent, \r\rThe full relation, which must needs be strange, \r\rWorthy of sacred silence to be heard. \r\rAnd we have yet large day, for scarce the sun \r\rHath finished half his journey, and scarce begins \r\rHis other half in the great zone of heaven." * 560 \r\rThus Adam made request; and Raphael, \rAfter short pause assenting, thus began : \r\r"High matter thou enjoin\'st me, O prime of men, \rSad task and hard; for how shall I relate \rTo human sense the invisible exploits \rOf warring Spirits? how, without remorse, \rThe ruin of so many, glorious once \rAnd perfect while they stood? how, last, unfold \rThe secrets of another world, perhaps \rNot lawful to reveal? Yet for thy good 570 \r\rThis is dispensed, and what surmounts the reach \rOf human sense I shall delineate so, \rBy likening spiritual to corporal forms, \rAs may express them best though what if Earth \rBe but the shadow of Heaven, and things therein \rEach to other like, more than on Earth is thought! \r\r"As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild \rReigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now \r\rrests \r\rUpon her centre poised; when on a day \r(For time, though in eternity, applied 580 \r\rTo motion, measures all things durable \rBy present, past, and future), on such day \r\r\r\rBOOK V. 151 \r\rAs Heaven\'s great year brings forth, the empyreal host \r\rOf Angels, by imperial summons called, \r\rInnumerable before the Almighty\'s throne \r\rForthwith from all the ends of Heaven appeared \r\rUnder their Hierarchs in orders bright : \r\rTen thousand thousand ensigns high advanced, \r\rStandards and gonfalons, \'twixt van and rear, \r\rStream in the air, and for distinction serve 590 \r\rOf Hierarchies, of orders, and degrees; \r\rOr in their glittering tissues bear emblazed \r\rHoly memorials, acts of zeal and love \r\rRecorded eminent. Thus when in orbs \r\rOf circuit inexpressible they stood, \r\rOrb within orb, the Father Infinite, \r\rBy whom in bliss embosomed sat the Son, \r\rAmidst, as from a flaming mount, whose top \r\rBrightness had made invisible, thus spake: \r\r" * Hear, all ye Angels, progeny of light, 600 \r\rThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers, \rHear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand! \rThis day I have begot whom I declare \rMy only Son, and on this holy hill \rHim have anointed, whom ye now behold \rAt my right hand; your head I him appoint, \rAnd by myself have sworn, to him shall bow \rAll knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord. \rUnder his great vicegerent reign abide \rUnited as one individual soul, 610 \r\rFor ever happy. Him who disobeys \rMe disobeys, breaks union, and that day, \rCast out from God and blessed vision, falls \rInto utter darkness deep engulfed, his place \rOrdained without redemption, without end.\' \r\r\r\r152 PARADISE LOST. \r\r" So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words \rAll seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all. \rThat day, as other solemn days, they spent \rIn song and dance about the sacred hill; \rMystical dance, which yonder starry sphere 620 \r\rOf planets and of fixed in all her wheels \rResembles nearest mazes intricate, \rEccentric, intervolved, yet regular \rThen most when most irregular they seem ; \rAnd in their motions harmony divine \rSo smooths her charming tones that God\'s own ear \rListens delighted. Evening now approached \r(For we have also our evening and our morn, \rWe ours for change delectable, not need), \rForthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn 630 \r\rDesirous : all in circles as they stood, \rTables are set, and on a sudden piled \rWith Angels\' food, and rubied nectar flows \rIn pearl, in diamond, and massy gold, \rFruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven. \rOn flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned, \rThey eat, they drink, and in communion sweet \rQuaff immortality and joy, secure \rOf surfeit where full measure only bounds \rExcess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered 640 \rWith copious hand, rejoicing in their joy. \rNow when ambrosial night, with clouds exhaled \rFrom that high mount of God whence light and shade \rSpring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed \rTo grateful twilight (for night comes not there \rIn darker veil), and roseate dews disposed \rA.11 but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest, \rWide over all the plain, and wider far \r\r\r\rBOOK V. 153 \r\rThan all this globous Earth in plain outspread \r\r(Such are the courts of God), the angelic throng, 650 \r\rDispersed in bands and files, their camp extend \r\rBy living streams among the trees of life \r\rPavilions numberless and sudden reared, \r\rCelestial tabernacles, where they slept \r\rFanned with cool winds ; save those who, in their course, \r\rMelodious hymns about the sovran throne \r\rAlternate all night long. But not so waked \r\rSatan so call him now; his former name \r\rIs heard no more in Heaven. He, of the first, \r\rIf not the first Archangel, great in power, 660 \r\rIn favour, and pre-eminence, yet fraught \r\rWith envy against the Son of God, that day \r\rHonoured by his great Father, and proclaimed \r\rMessiah, King anointed, could not bear \r\rThrough pride that sight, and thought himself impaired. \r\rDeep malice thence conceiving and disdain, \r\rSoon as midnight brought on the dusky hour \r\rFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved \r\rWith all his legions to dislodge, and leave \r\rUnworshipped, unobeyed, the throne supreme, 670 \r\rContemptuous; and, his next subordinate \r\rAwakening, thus to him in secret spake : \r\r" \' Sleep\'st thou. companion dear ? what sleep can close \rThy eyelids? and rememberest what decree, \rOf yesterday, so late hath passed the lips \rOf Heaven\'s Almighty? Thou to me thy thoughts \rWast wont, I mine to thee was wont, to impart; \rBoth waking we were one ; how, then, can now \rThy sleep dissent? New laws thou seest imposed: \rNew laws from him who reigns new minds may raise 680 \rIn us who serve new counsels, to debate \r\r\r\r154 PARADISE LOST. \r\rWhat doubtful may ensue : more in this place \r\rTo utter is not safe. Assemble thou \r\rOf all those myriads which we lead the chief; \r\rTell them that by command^ere yet dim night \r\rHer shadowy cloud withdraws, I am tcTTjaste, \r\rAnd all who under me their banners wave, \r\rHomeward with flying march where we possess \r\rThe quarters of the North, there to prepare \r\rFit entertainment to receive our King, 690 \r\rThe great Messiah, and his new commands, \r\rWho speedily through all the Hierarchies \r\rIntends to pass triumphant, and give laws.\' \r\r"So spake the false Archangel, and infused \rBad influence into the unwary breast \rOf his associate. He together calls, \rOr several one by one, the regent powers, \rUnder him regent; tells, as he was taught, \rThat, the Most High commanding, now ere night, \rNow ere dim night had disencumbered Heaven, 700 \r\rThe great Hierarchal standard was to move; \rTells the suggested cause, and casts between \rAmbiguous words and jealousies, to sound \rOr taint integrity. But all obeyed \rThe wonted signal, and superior voice \rOf their great Potentate; for great indeed \rHis name, and high was his degree in Heaven : \rHis countenance, as the morning-star that guides \rThe starry flock, allured them, and with lies \rDrew after him the third part of Heaven\'s host. 710 \r\rMeanwhile, the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns \rAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount, \rAnd from within the golden lamps that burn \rNightly before him, saw without their light \r\r\r\rBOOK V. 155 \r\rRebellion rising saw in whom, how spread \rAmong the Sons of Morn, what multitudes \rWere banded to oppose his high decree; \rAnd, smiling, to his only Son thus said : \r\r" \' Son, thou in whom my glory I behold \rIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might, 720 \r\rNearly it now concerns us to be sure \rOf our omnipotence, and with what arms \rWe mean to hold what anciently we claim \rOf deity or empire : such a foe \rIs rising, who intends to erect his throne \rEqual to ours, throughout the spacious North; \rNor so content, hath in his thought to try \rIn battle what our power is or our right. \rLet us advise, and to this hazard draw \rWith speed what force is left, and all employ 73 \r\rIn our defence, lest unawares we lose \rThis our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.\' \r\r"To whom the Son, with calm aspect and clear, \rLightening divine, ineffable, serene, \rMade answer: \'Mighty Father, thou thy foes \rJustly hast in derision, and secure \rLaugh\'st at their vain designs and tumults vain, \rMatter to me of glory, whom their hate \rIllustrates, when they see all regal power \rGiven me to quell their pride, and in event 740 \r\rKnow whether I be dextrous to subdue \rThy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.\' \r\r"So spake the Son; but Satan with his powers f \rFar was advanced on winged speed, an host \rInnumerable as the stars of night, \rOr stars of morning, dew-drops which the sun \rImpearls on every leaf and every flower. \r\r\r\r156 PARADISE LOST. \r\rRegions they passed, the mighty regencies \r\rOf Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones \r\rIn their triple degrees regions to which 750 \r\rAll thy dominion, Adam, is no more \r\rThan what this Garden is to all the earth \r\rAnd all the sea, from one entire globose \r\rStretched into longitude; which having passed, \r\rAt length into the limits of the North \r\rThey came, and Satan to his royal seat \r\rHigh on a hill, far-blazing, as a mount \r\rRaised on a mount, with pyramids and towers \r\rFrom diamond quarries hewn and rocks of gold, \r\rThe palace of great Lucifer (so call 760 \r\rThat structure, in the dialect of men \r\rInterpreted) which not long after he, \r\rAffecting all equality with God, \r\rIn imitation of that mount whereon \r\rMessiah was declared in sight of Heaven, \r\rThe Mountain of the Congregation called; \r\rFor thither he assembled all his train, \r\rPretending so commanded to consult \r\rAbout the great reception of their King, \r\rThither to come ; and with calumnious art 770 \r\rOf counterfeited truth thus held their ears : \r\r"\'Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers, \rIf these magnific titles yet remain \rNot merely titular, since by decree \rAnother now hath to himself engrossed \rAll power, and us eclipsed under the name \rOf King anointed; for whom all this haste \rOf midnight march, and hurried meeting here, \rThis only to consult, how we may best, \rWith what may be devised of honours new, 780 \r\r\r\rBOOK V. 157 \r\rReceive him coming to receive from us \r\rKnee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile ! \r\rToo much to one ! but double how endured \r\rTo one and to his image now proclaimed? \r\rBut what if better counsels might erect \r\rOur minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke ! \r\rWill ye submit your necks, and choose to bend \r\rThe supple knee? Ye will not, if I trust \r\rTo know ye right, or if ye know yourselves \r\rNatives and Sons of Heaven possessed before 790 \r\rBy none, and if not equal all, yet free, \r\rEqually free; for orders and degrees \r\rJar not with liberty, but well consist. \r\rWho can in reason, then, or right, assume \r\rMonarchy over such as live by right \r\rHis equals if in power and splendour less, \r\rIn freedom equal? or can introduce \r\rLaw and edict on us, who without law \r\rErr not? much less for this to be our Lord, \r\rAnd look for adoration, to the abuse 800 \r\rOf those imperial titles which assert \r\rOur being ordained to govern, not to serve !\' S \r\r"Thus far his bold discourse without control \rHad audience, when among the Seraphim \rAbdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored \rThe Deity, and divine commands obeyed, \rStood up, and in a flame of zeal severe \rThe current of his fury thus opposed : \r\r" \' O argument blasphemous, false, and proud ! \rWords which no ear ever to hear in Heaven 810 \r\rExpected, least of all from thee, ingrate, \rIn place thyself so high above thy peers ! \rCanst thou with impious obloquy condemn \r\r\r\rI5& PARADISE LOST. \r\rThe just decree of God, pronounced and sworn, \r\rThat to his only Son, by right endued \r\rWith regal sceptre, every soul in Heaven \r\rShall bend the knee, and in that honour due \r\rConfess him rightful King? Unjust, thou say\'st, \r\rFlatly unjust, to bind with laws the free, \r\rAnd equal over equals to let reign, 820 \r\rOne over all with unsucceeded power! \r\rShalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute \r\rWith Him the points of liberty, who made- \'\' \r\rThee what thou art, and formed the powers of Heaven \r\rSuch as he pleased, and circumscribed their being? \r\rYet, by experience taught, we know how good, \r\rAnd of our good and of our dignity \r\rHow provident he is how far from thought \r\rTo make us less; bent rather to exalt \r\rOur happy state, under one head more near 830 \r\rUnited. But to grant it thee unjust \r\rThat equal over equals monarch reign : \r\rThyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count, \r\rOr all angelic nature joined in one, \r\rEqual to him, begotten Son? by whom, \r\rAs by his Word, the mighty Father made \r\rAll things, even thee, and all the Spirits of Heaven \r\rBy him created in their bright degrees, \r\rCrowned them with glory, and to their glory named \r\rThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers, 840 \r\rEssential Powers; nor by his reign obscured, \r\rBut more illustrious made; since he, the head, \r\rOne of our number thus reduced becomes; \r\rHis laws our laws; all honour to him done \r\rReturns our own. Cease, then, this impious rage, \r\rAnd tempt not these; but hasten to appease \r\r\r\rBOOK V. \r\r\r\r159 \r\r\r\rThe incensed Father and the incensed Son \rWhile pardon may be found, in time besought.\' l \r\r"So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal \rNone seconded, as out of season judged, 850 \r\rOr singular and rash; whereat rejoiced \rThe Apostate, and more haughty thus replied : \r\r" \' That we were formed, then, say\'st thou ? and the work \rOf secondary hands, by task transferred \rFrom Father to his Son ? Strange point and new ! \rDoctrine which we would know whence learned ! Who saw \rWhen this creation was? Remember\'st thou \rThy making, while the Maker gave thee being? \rWe know no time when we were not as now; \rKnow none before us, self-begot, self-raised 860 \r\rBy our own quickening power, when fatal course \rHad circled his full orb, the birth mature \rOf this our native Heaven, Ethereal Sons. \rOur puissance is our own; our own right hand \rShall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try \rWho is our equal : then thou shalt behold \rWhether by supplication we intend \rAddress, and to begirt the Almighty throne \rBeseeching or besieging. This report, \rThese tidings, carry to the anointed King; 870 \r\rAnd fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.\' \r\r"He said; and, as the sound of waters deep, \rHoarse murmur echoed to his words applause \rThrough the infinite host; nor less for that \rThe flaming Seraph, fearless, though alone, \rEncompassed round with foes, thus answered bold: \r\r" \' O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed, \rForsaken of all good ! I see thy fall \rDetermined, and thy hapless crew involved \r\r\r\rl6o PARADISE LOST. \r\r\r\rIn this perfidious fraud, contagion spread 880 \r\rBoth of thy crime and punishment. Henceforth \rNo more be troubled how to quit the yoke \rOf God\'s Messiah; those indulgent laws \rWill not be now vouchsafed; other decrees \rAgainst thee are gone forth without recall; \rThat golden sceptre which thou didst reject \rIs now an iron rod to bruise and break \rThy disobedience. Well thou didst advise; \rYet nor for thy advice or threats I fly \rThese wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath 890 \r\rImpendent, raging into sudden flame, \rDistinguish not : for soon expect to feel \rHis thunder on thy head, devouring fire. \rThen who created thee lamenting learn, \rWhen who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.\' \r"So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found; \rAmong the faithless, faithful only he; \rAmong innumerable false, unmoved, \rUnshaken, unseduced, unterrified, \r\rHis loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal; 900 \r\rNor number nor example with him wrought \rTo swerve from truth, or change his constant mind, \rThough single. From amidst them forth he passed, \rLong way through hostile scorn, which he sustained \rSuperior, nor of violence feared aught; \rAnd with retorted scorn his back he turned \rOn those proud towers, to swift destruction doomed." \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. \r\r\r\rP. L. U \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\r\r\rRaphael continues to relate how Michael and Gabriel were sent \rforth to battle against Satan and his Angels. The first fight described : \rSatan and his Powers retire under night ; he calls a council ; invents \rdevilish engines, which, in the second day\'s fight, put Michael and his \rAngels to some disorder ; but they at length, pulling up mountains, \roverwhelmed both the force and machines of Satan. Yet, the tumult \rnot so ending, God, on the third day, sends Messiah his Son, for whom \rhe had reserved the glory of that victory. He, in the power of his \rFather, coming to the place, and causing all his legions to stand still on \reither side, with his chariot and thunder driving into the midst of his \renemies, pursues them, unable to resist, towards the wall of Heaven ; \rwhich opening, they leap down with horror and confusion into the place \rof punishment prepared for them in the deep. Messiah returns with \rtriumph to his Father. \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. \r\r\r\r1, night the dreadless Angel, unpursued, \rThrough Heaven\'s wide champain held his way, \rtill Morn, \r\rWaked by the circling) Hours, with \rUnbarred the gates of light. There is \'a cave \rWithin the mount of God7fast by his throne, \rWhere light and darkness. .in perpetu^TrQunJ \rLodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven \rGrateful vicissitude, like day. and night ; \rLight issues forth, and at the other door \rObsequious, darkness Centers, till her hour 10 \r\rTo veil the Heaven, though_jdarkness there might well \rSeem twilight" here. And now went forth the, "Morn - \rSuch as in highest Heaven, arrayed in(goldL^ \rEmpyreal; from before her vanished Night, \rShot through with orient beams ; when all the plain \rCovered with thick embattled squadrons bright, \rChariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds, \rReflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view : \rWar he perceived, war in procinct, and found \rAlready known what he for news had thought 20 \r\rTo have reported; gladly then he mixed \r\rII 2 \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. \r\rAmong those friendly powers, who him received \rWith joy and acclamations loud, that one, \rThat of so many myriads fallen yet one, \rReturned not lost. On to the sacred hill \rThey led him high applauded, and present \rBefore the seat supreme ; from whence a voice, \rFrom midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard : \r\r" * Servant of God, well done ! Well hast thou fought \rThe better fight, who single hast maintained 30 \r\rAgainst revolted multitudes the cause \rOf truth, in word mightier than they in arms; \rAnd for the testimony of truth hast borne \rUniversal reproach, far worse to bear \rThan violence; for this was all thy care \rTo stand approved in sight of God, though worlds \rJudged thee perverse. The easier conquest now \rRemains thee aided by this host of friends, \rBack on thy foes more glorious to return \rThan scorned thou didst depart, and to subdue 40 \r\rBy force who reason for their law refuse, \rRight reason for their law, and for their King \rMessiah, who by right of merit reigns. \rGo, Michael, of celestial armies prince, \rAnd thou, in military prowess next, \rGabriel; lead forth to battle these my sons \rInvincible; lead forth my armed Saints, \rBy thousands and by millions ranged for fight, \rEqual in number to that godless crew \rRebellious; them with fire and hostile arms 50 \r\rFearless assault, and, to the brow of Heaven \rPursuing, drive them out from God and bliss, \rInto their place of punishment, the gulf \rOf Tartarus, which ready opens wide \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. 165 \r\rHis fiery chaos to receive their fall.\' \r\r"So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began \rTo darken all the hill, and smoke to roll \rIn dusky wreaths reluctant flames, the sign \rOf wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud \rEthereal trumpet from on high gan blow : 60 \r\rAt which command the powers militant \rThat stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined \rOf union irresistible, moved on \rIn silence their bright legions, to the sound \rOf instrumental harmony, that breathed \rHeroic ardour to adventurous deeds \rUnder their godlike leaders, in the cause \rOf God and his Messiah. On they move, \rIndissolubly firm ; nor obvious hill, \r\rNor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides 70 \rTheir perfect ranks; for high above the ground \rTheir march was, and the passive air upbore \rTheir nimble tread; as when the total kind \rOf birds, in orderly array, on wing \rCame summoned over Eden to receive \rTheir names of thee; so over many a tract \rOf Heaven they marched, and many a province wide, \rTenfold the length of this terrene. At last, \rFar in the horizon to the North, appeared \rFrom skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched 80 \r\rIn battailous aspect ; and, nearer view, \rBristled with upright beams innumerable \rOf rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields \rVarious, with boastful argument portrayed, \rThe banded powers of Satan hasting on \rWith furious expedition ; for they weened \rThat self-same day, by fight or by surprise, \r\r\r\r1 66 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTo win the mount of God, and on his throne \r\rTo set the envier of his state, the proud \r\rAspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain 90 \r\rIn the mid-way. Though strange to us it seemed \r\rAt first that Angel should with Angel war, \r\rAnd in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet \r\rSo oft in festivals of joy and love \r\rUnanimous, as sons of one great Sire, \r\rHymning the Eternal Father. But the shout \r\rOf battle now began, and rushing sound \r\rOf onset ended soon each milder thought. \r\rHigh in the midst, exalted as a god, \r\rThe Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat, 100 \r\rIdol of majesty divine, enclosed \r\rWith flaming Cherubim and golden shields ; \r\rThen lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now \r\r\'Twixt host and host but narrow space was left, \r\rA dreadful interval, and front to front \r\rPresented stood, in terrible array \r\rOf hideous length. Before the cloudy van, \r\rOn the rough edge of battle ere it joined, \r\rSatan, with vast and haughty strides advanced, \r\rCame towering, armed in adamant and gold. no \r\rAbdiel that sight endured not, where he stood \r\rAmong the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, \r\rAnd thus his own undaunted heart explores : \r\r" \' O Heaven ! that such resemblance of the Highest \rShould yet remain, where faith and realty \rRemain not ! Wherefore should not strength and might \rThere fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove \rWhere boldest, though to sight unconquerable? \rHis puissance, trusting in the Almighty\'s aid, \rI mean to try, whose reason I have tried 120 \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. 167 \r\rUnsound and false ; nor is it aught but just \rThat he who in debate of truth hath won \rShould win in arms, in both disputes alike \rVictor; though brutish that contest and foul, \rWhen reason hath to deal with force, yet so \rMost reason is that reason overcome.\' \r\r" So pondering, and from his armed peers \rForth-stepping opposite, half-way he met \rHis daring foe, at this prevention more \rIncensed, and thus securely him defied : 130 \r\r" \' Proud, art thou met ? Thy hope was to have reached \rThe highth of thy aspiring unopposed, \rThe throne of God unguarded, and his side \rAbandoned at the terror of thy power \rOr potent tongue. Fool ! not to think how vain \rAgainst the Omnipotent to rise in arms; \rWho, out of smallest things, could without end \rHave raised incessant armies to defeat \rThy folly; or with solitary hand, \r\rReaching beyond all limit, at one blow, 140 \r\rUnaided could have finished thee, and whelmed \rThy legions under darkness ! But thou seest \rAll are not of thy train; there be who faith \rPrefer, and piety to God, though then \rTo thee not visible when I alone \rSeemed in thy world erroneous to dissent \rFrom all : my sect thou seest ; now learn too late \rHow few sometimes may know, when thousands err.\' \r\r"Whom the grand Foe, with scornful eye askance, \rThus answered: \'111 for thee, but in wished hour 150 \rOf my revenge, first sought for, thou return\'st \rFrom flight, seditious Angel, to receive \rThy merited reward, the first assay \r\r\r\r1 68 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOf this right hand provoked, since first that tongue, \r\rInspired with contradiction, durst oppose \r\rA third part of the gods, in synod met \r\rTheir deities to assert ; who, while they feel \r\rVigour divine within them, can allow \r\rOmnipotence to none. But well thou com\'st \r\rBefore thy fellows, ambitious to win 160 \r\rFrom me some plume, that thy success may show \r\rDestruction to the rest. This pause between \r\r(Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know \r\rAt first I thought that liberty and Heaven \r\rTo heavenly souls had been all one ; but now \r\rI see that most through sloth had rather serve, \r\rMinistering Spirits, trained up in feast and song: \r\rSuch hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven, \r\rServility with freedom to contend, \r\rAs both their deeds compared this day shall prove.\' 170 \r\r"To whom, in brief, thus Abdiel stern replied: \r* Apostate! still thou err\'st, nor end wilt find \rOf erring, from the path of truth remote. \rUnjustly thou deprav\'st it with the name \rOf servitude, to serve whom God ordains, \rOr Nature: God and Nature bid the same, \rWhen he who rules is worthiest, and excels \rThem whom he governs. This is servitude, \rTo serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled \rAgainst his worthier, as thine now serve thee, iSo \r\rThyself not free, but to thyself enthralled; \rYet lewdly dar\'st our ministering upbraid. \rReign thou in Hell, thy kingdom ; let me serve \rIn Heaven God ever blest, and his divine \rBehests obey, worthiest to be obeyed; \rYet chains in Hell, not realms, expect : meanwhile, \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. \r\r\r\rI6 9 \r\r\r\rFrom me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight, \rThis greeting on thy impious crest receive.\' \r"So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, \rWhich hung not, but so swift with tempest fell 190 \r\rOn the proud crest of Satan that no sight, \rNor motion of swift thought, less could his shield, \rSuch ruin intercept. Ten paces huge \rHe back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee \rHis massy spear upstayed : as if, on Earth, \rWinds under ground, or waters forcing way, \rSidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat, \rHalf-sunk with all his pines. Amazement seized \rThe rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see \rThus foiled their mightiest; ours joy rilled, and shout, \rPresage of victory, and fierce desire 201 \r\rOf battle : whereat Michael bid sound \rThe Archangel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven \rIt sounded, and the faithful armies rung \rHosannah to the Highest ; nor stood at gaze \rThe adverse legions, nor less hideous joined \rThe horrid shock. Now storming fury rose, \rAnd clamour such as heard in Heaven till now \rWas never; arms on armour clashing brayed \rHorrible discord, and the madding wheels 210 \r\rOf brazen chariots raged ; dire was the noise \rOf conflict; overhead the dismal hiss \rOf fiery darts in flaming volleys flew, \rAnd, flying, vaulted either host with fire. \rSo under fiery cope together rushed \rBoth battles main, with ruinous assault \rAnd inextinguishable rage; all Heaven \rResounded, and, had Earth been then, all Earth \rHad to her centre shook. What wonder, when \r\r\r\r170 PARADISE LOST. \r\rMillions of fierce encountering Angels fought 220 \r\rOn either side, the least of whom could wield \r\rThese elements, and arm him with the force \r\rOf all their regions ? How much more of power \r\rArmy against army numberless to raise \r\rDreadful combustion warring, and disturb, \r\rThough not destroy, their happy native seat ! \r\rHad not the Eternal King Omnipotent \r\rFrom his stronghold of Heaven high overruled \r\rAnd limited their might; though numbered such \r\rAs each divided legion might have seemed 230 \r\rA numerous host; in strength each armed hand \r\rA legion ; led in fight, yet leader seemed \r\rEach warrior single as in chief expert \r\rWhen to advance, or stand, or turn the sway \r\rOf battle, open when, and when to close \r\rThe ridges of grim war. No thought of flight, \r\rNone of retreat, no unbecoming deed \r\rThat argued fear; each on himself relied, \r\rAs only in his arm the moment lay \r\rOf victory. Deeds of eternal fame 240 \r\rWere done, but infinite; for wide was spread \r\rThat war, and various : sometimes on firm ground \r\rA standing fight; then, soaring on main wing, \r\rTormented all the air; all air seemed then \r\rConflicting fire. Long time in even scale \r\rThe battle hung ; till Satan, who that day \r\rProdigious power had shown, and met in arms \r\rNo equal, ranging through the dire attack \r\rOf fighting Seraphim confused, at length \r\rSaw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled 250 \r\rSquadrons at once : with huge two-handed sway \r\rBrandished aloft the horrid edge came down \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. I^I \r\rWide-wasting; such destruction to withstand \r\rHe hasted, and opposed the rocky orb \r\rOf tenfold adamant, his ample shield, \r\rA vast circumference. At his approach \r\rThe great Archangel from his warlike toil \r\rSurceased, and, glad, as hoping here to end \r\rIntestine war in Heaven, the Arch-foe subdued \r\rOr captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown 260 \r\rAnd visage all inflamed, first thus began : \r\r" * Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, \rUnnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest \rThese acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, \rThough heaviest, by just measure, on thyself \rAnd thy adherents : how hast thou disturbed \rHeaven\'s blessed peace, and into Nature brought \rMisery, uncreated till the crime \rOf thy rebellion ! how hast thou instilled \rThy malice into thousands, once upright 270 \r\rAnd faithful, now proved false ! But think not here \rTo trouble holy rest;. Heaven casts thee out \rFrom all her confines; Heaven, the seat of bliss, \rBrooks not the works of violence and war. \rHence, then, and evil go with thee along, \rThy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell, \rThou and thy wicked crew ! there mingle broils, \rEre this avenging sword begin thy doom, \rOr some more sudden vengeance, winged from God, \rPrecipitate thee with augmented pain.\' 280 \r\r" So spake the prince of Angels ; to whom thus \rThe Adversary : * Nor think thou with wind \rOf airy threats to awe whom yet with deeds \rThou canst not. Hast thou turned the least of these \rTo flight or, if to fall, but that they rise \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. \r\rUnvanquished easier to transact with me \r\rThat thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats \r\rTo chase me hence? Err not that so shall end \r\rThe strife which thou call\'st evil, but we style \r\rThe strife of glory; which we mean to win, 290 \r\rOr turn this Heaven itself into the Hell \r\rThou fablest; here, however, to dwell free, \r\rIf not to reign. Meanwhile, thy utmost force \r\r(And join him named Almighty to thy aid) \r\rI fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.\' \r\r"They ended parle, and both addressed for fight \rUnspeakable; for who, though with the tongue \rOf Angels, can relate, or to what things \rLiken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift \rHuman imagination to such highth 300 \r\rOf godlike power? for likest gods they seemed, \rStood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms, \rFit to decide the empire of great Heaven. \rNow waved their fiery swords, and in the air \rMade horrid circles; two broad suns their shields \rBlazed opposite, while Expectation stood \rIn horror; from each hand with speed retired, \rWhere erst was thickest fight, the angelic throng, \rAnd left large field, unsafe within the wind \rOf such commotion : such as (to set forth 310 \r\rGreat things by small) if, Nature\'s concord broke, \rAmong the constellations war were sprung, \rTwo planets, rushing from aspect malign \rOf fiercest opposition, in mid sky \rShould combat, and their jarring spheres confound. \rTogether both, with next to almighty arm \rUplifted imminent, one stroke they aimed \rThat might determine, and not need repeat, \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. 173 \r\rAs not of power at once; nor odds appeared \r\rIn might or swift prevention. But the sword 320 \r\rOf Michael from the armoury of God \r\rWas given him tempered so, that neither keen \r\rNor solid might resist that edge : it met \r\rThe sword of Satan, with steep force to smite \r\rDescending, and in half cut sheer; nor stayed, \r\rBut, with swift wheel reverse, deep entering shared \r\rAll his right side. Then Satan first knew pain, \r\rAnd writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore \r\rThe griding sword with discontinuous wound \r\rPassed through him ; but the ethereal substance closed, 330 \r\rNot long divisible, and from the gash \r\rA stream of nectarous humour issuing flowed \r\rSanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed, \r\rAnd all his armour stained, erewhile so bright \r\rForthwith on all sides to his aid was run \r\rBy Angels many and strong, who interposed \r\rDefence, while others bore him on their shields \r\rBack to his chariot, where it stood retired \r\rFrom off the files of war; there they him laid \r\rGnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame 340 \r\rTo find himself not matchless, and his pride \r\rHumbled by such rebuke, so far beneath \r\rHis confidence to equal God in power. \r\rYet soon he healed; for Spirits, that live throughout \r\rVital in every part not, as frail Man, \r\rIn entrails, heart or head, liver or reins \r\rCannot but by annihilating die; \r\rNor in their liquid texture mortal wound \r\rReceive, no more than can the fluid air : \r\rAll heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear, 350 \r\rAll intellect, all sense; and as they please \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. \r\rThey limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size \rAssume, as likes them best, condense or rare. \r\r" Meanwhile, in other parts, like deeds deserved \rMemorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, \rAnd with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array \rOf Moloch, furious king, who him defied, \rAnd at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound \rThreatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven \rRefrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon, 360 \r\rDown cloven to the waist, with shattered arms \rAnd uncouth pain fled bellowing. On each wing \rUriel and Raphael his vaunting foe, \rThough huge and in a rock of diamond armed, \rVanquished Adramelech and Asmadai, \rTwo potent Thrones, that to be less than gods \rDisdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight, \rMangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail. \rNor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy \rThe atheist crew, but with redoubled blow 370 \r\rAriel, and Arioch, and the violence \rOf Ramiel, scorched and blasted, overthrew. \rI might relate of thousands, and their names \rEternize here on Earth; but those elect \rAngels, contented with their fame in Heaven, \rSeek not the praise of men : the other sort, \rIn might though wondrous and in acts of war, \rNor of renown less eager, yet by doom \rCancelled from Heaven and sacred memory, \rNameless in dark oblivion let them dwell; 380 \r\rFor strength from truth divided, and from just, \rIllaudable, nought merits but dispraise \rAnd ignominy, yet to glory aspires, \rVain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame : \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. I7 5 \r\rTherefore eternal silence be their doom. \r\r"And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved, \rWith many an inroad gored ; deformed rout \rEntered, and foul disorder; all the ground \rWith shivered armour strown, and on a heap \rChariot and charioter lay overturned, 390 \r\rAnd fiery foaming steeds; what stood recoiled, \rO\'er-wearied, through the faint Satanic host, \rDefensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised, \rThen first with fear surprised and sense of pain, \rFled ignominious, to such evil brought \rBy sin of disobedience; till that hour \rNot liable to fear, or flight, or pain. \rFar otherwise the inviolable Saints \rIn cubic phalanx firm advanced entire, \rInvulnerable, impenetrably armed; 400 \r\rSuch high advantages their innocence \rGave them above their foes not to have sinned, \rNot to have disobeyed; in fight they stood \rUnwearied, unobnoxious to be pained \rBy wound, though from their place by violence moved. \r\r"Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven \rInducing darkness, grateful truce imposed, \rAnd silence on the odious din of war; \rUnder her cloudy covert both retired, \rVictor and vanquished. On the foughten field 410 \r\rMichael and his Angels prevalent \rEncamping placed in guard their watches round, \rCherubic waving fires : on the other part, \rSatan with his rebellious disappeared, \rFar in the dark dislodged, and, void of rest, \rHis potentates to council called by night, \rAnd in the midst thus undismayed began: \r\r\r\ri;6 PARADISE LOST. \r\rt(t O now in danger tried, now known in arms \rNot to be overpowered, companions dear, \rFound worthy not of liberty alone, 420 \r\rToo mean pretence, but, what we more affect, \rHonour, dominion, glory, and renown; \rWho have sustained one day in doubtful fight ; \r(And if one day, why not eternal days?) \rWhat Heaven\'s Lord had powerfullest to send \rAgainst us from about his throne, and judged \rSufficient to subdue us to his will, \rBut proves not so : then fallible, it seems, \rOf future we may deem him, though till now \rOmniscient thought. True is, less firmly armed, 430 \r\rSome disadvantage we endured, and pain \rTill now not known, but, known, as soon contemned; \rSince now we find this our empyreal form \rIncapable of mortal injury, \rImperishable, and, though pierced with wound, \rSoon closing, and by native vigour healed. \rOf evil, then, so small as easy think \rThe remedy : perhaps more valid arms, \rWeapons more violent, when next we meet, \rMay serve to better us and worse our foes, 440 \r\rOr equal what between us made the odds, \rIn nature none : if other hidden cause \rLeft them superior, while we can preserve \rUnhurt our minds, and understanding sound, \rDue search and consultation will disclose.\' \r\r"He sat; and in the assembly next upstood \rNisroch, of Principalities the prime; \rAs one he stood escaped from cruel fight, \rSore toiled, his riven arms to havoc hewn, \rAnd, cloudy in aspect, thus answering spake: 450 \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. ^7 \r\r" \' Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free \rEnjoyment of our right as gods ! yet hard \rFor gods, and too unequal work, we find \rAgainst unequal arms to fight in pain, \rAgainst unpained, impassive ; from which evil \rRuin must needs ensue ; for what avails \rValour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain, \rWhich all subdues, and makes remiss the hands \rOf mightiest? Sense of pleasure we may well \rSpare out of life perhaps, and not repine, 460 \r\rBut live content, which is the calmest life; \rBut pain is perfect misery, the worst \rOf evils, and, excessive, overturns \rAll patience. He who, therefore, can invent \rWith what more forcible we may offend \rOur yet unwounded enemies, or arm \rOurselves with like defence, to me deserves \rNo less than for deliverance what we owe.\' \r\r" Whereto, with look composed, Satan replied : \r\'Not uninvented that, which thou aright 470 \r\rBeliev\'st so main to our success, I bring. \rWhich of us who beholds the bright surface \rOf this ethereous mould whereon we stand \rThis continent of spacious Heaven, adorned \rWith plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems and gold \rWhose eye so superficially surveys \rThese things, as not to mind from whence they grow \rDeep under ground, materials dark and crude, \rOf spiritous and fiery spume, till touched \rWith Heaven\'s ray, and tempered, they shoot forth 480 \rSo beauteous, opening to the ambient light? \rThese in their dark nativity the deep \rShall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame; \r\rp. L. 12 \r\r\r\r1 78 PARADISE LOST. \r\rWhich, into hollow engines long and round \r\rThick-rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire \r\rDilated and infuriate, shall send forth \r\rFrom far, with thundering noise, among our foes \r\rSuch implements of mischief as shall dash \r\rTo pieces and o\'erwhelm whatever stands \r\rAdverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed 490 \r\rThe Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. \r\rNor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn \r\rEffect shall end our wish. Meanwhile revive; \r\rAbandon fear; to strength and counsel joined \r\rThink nothing hard, much less to be despaired.\' \r\r" He ended ; and his words their drooping cheer \rEnlightened, and their languished hope revived. \rThe invention all admired, and each how he \rTo be the inventor missed ; so easy it seemed \rOnce found, which yet unfound most would have thought \rImpossible. Yet, haply, of thy race, 501 \r\rIn future days, if malice should abound, \rSome one intent on mischief, or inspired \rWith devilish machination, might devise \rLike instrument to plague the sons of men \rFor sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent. \rForthwith from council to the work they flew; \rNone arguing stood; innumerable hands \rWere ready; in a moment up they turned \rWide the celestial soil, and saw beneath 510 \r\rThe originals of Nature in their crude \rConception; sulphurous and nitrous foam \rThey found, they mingled, and, with subtle art \rConcocted and adusted, they reduced \rTo blackest grain, and into store conveyed. \rPart hidden veins digged up (nor hath this Earth \r\r\r\r\r\r\rBOOK VI. \r\r\r\r1/9 \r\r\r\rEntrails unlike) of mineral and stone, \r\rWhereof to found their engines and their balls \r\rOf missive ruin; part incentive reed \r\rProvide, pernicious with one touch to fire. 520 \r\rSo all ere day-spring, under conscious night, \r\rSecret they finished, and in order set, \r\rWith silent circumspection, unespied. \r\r"Now when fair Morn orient in Heaven appeared, \rUp rose the victor Angels, and to arms \rThe matin trumpet sung: in arms they stood \rOf golden panoply, refulgent host, \rSoon banded; others from the dawning hills \rLooked round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour, \rEach quarter, to descry the distant foe, 530 \r\rWhere lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight, \rIn motion or in halt. Him soon they met \rUnder spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow \rBut firm battalion ; back with speediest sail, \rZophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, \rCame flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried : \r\r"\'Arm, warriors, arm for fight! The foe at hand, \rWhom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit \rThis day; fear not his flight; so thick a cloud \rHe comes, and settled in his face I see 540 \r\rSad resolution and secure. Let each \rHis adamantine coat gird well, and each \rFit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield, \rBorne even or high; for this day will pour down, \rIf I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower, \rBut rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.\' \r\r" So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon \rIn order, quit of all impediment; \rInstant, without disturb, they took alarm, \r\r122 \r\r\r\rl8o PARADISE LOST. \r\rAnd onward move embattled : when, behold ! 550 \r\rNot distant far, with heavy pace the foe \r\rApproaching gross and huge; in hollow cube \r\rTraining his devilish enginry, impaled \r\rOn every side with shadowing squadrons deep, \r\rTo hide the fraud. At interview both stood \r\rA while; but suddenly at head appeared \r\rSatan, and thus was heard commanding loud : \r\r"\'Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold, \rThat all may see who hate us, how we seek \rPeace and composure, and with open breast 560 \r\rStand ready to receive them, if they like \rOur overture, and turn not back perverse; \rBut that I doubt: however, witness Heaven! \rHeaven, witness thou anon ! while we discharge \rFreely our part. Ye, who appointed stand, \rDo as you have in charge, and briefly touch \rWhat we propound, and loud that all may hear.\' \r\r"So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce \rHad ended, when to right and left the front \rDivided, and to either flank retired; 570 \r\rWhich to our eyes discovered, new and strange, \rA triple mounted row of pillars laid \rOn wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed, \rOr hollowed bodies made of oak or fir, \rWith branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled), \rBrass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths \rWith hideous orifice gaped on us wide, \rPortending hollow truce. At each behind \rA Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed \rStood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense, 580 \r\rCollected stood within our thoughts amused; \rNot long, for sudden all, at once, their reeds \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. l8l \r\rPut forth, and to a narrow vent applied 4 \r\rWith nicest touch. Immediate in a flame, \r\rBut soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared, \r\rFrom those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar \r\rEmbowelled with outrageous noise the air, \r\rAnd all her entrails tore, disgorging foul \r\rTheir devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail \r\rOf iron globes; which, on the victor host 590 \r\rLevelled, with such impetuous fury smote, \r\rThat whom they hit none on their feet might stand, \r\rThough standing else as rocks, but down they fell \r\rBy thousands, Angel on Archangel rolled, \r\rThe sooner for their arms : unarmed, they might \r\rHave easily, as Spirits, evaded swift \r\rBy quick contraction or remove; but now \r\rFoul dissipation followed, and forced rout; \r\rNor served it to relax their serried files. \r\rWhat should they do? If on they rushed, repulse 600 \r\rRepeated, and indecent overthrow \r\rDoubled, would render them yet more despised, \r\rAnd to their foes a laughter; for in view \r\rStood ranked of Seraphim another row, \r\rIn posture to displode their second tire \r\rOf thunder; back defeated to return \r\rThey worse abhorred. Satan beheld their plight, \r\rAnd to his mates thus in derision called : \r\r"*O friends, why come not on these victors proud? \rErewhile they fierce were coming; and when we, 610 \rTo entertain them fair with open front \rAnd breast (what could we more?), propounded terms \rOf composition, straight they changed their minds, \rFlew off, and into strange vagaries fell, \rAs they would dance : yet for a dance they seemed \r\r\r\r1 82 PARADISE LOST. \r\rSomewhat extravagant and wild, perhaps \rFor joy of offered peace. But I suppose, \rIf our proposals once again were heard, \rWe should compel them to a quick result.\' \r\r" To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood : 620 \r\'Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, \rOf hard contents, and full of force urged home, \rSuch as we might perceive amused them all, \rAnd stumbled many: who receives them right \rHad need from head to foot well understand; \rNot understood, this gift they have besides, \rThey show us when our foes walk not upright.\' \r\r"So they among themselves in pleasant vein \rStood scoffing, highthened in their thoughts beyond \rAll doubt of victory; Eternal Might 630 \r\rTo match with their inventions they presumed \rSo easy, and of his thunder made a scorn, \rAnd all his host derided, while they stood \rA while in trouble : but they stood not long ; \rRage prompted them at length, and found them arms \rAgainst such hellish mischief fit to oppose. \rForthwith (behold the excellence, the power, \rWhich God hath in his mighty Angels placed !) \rTheir arms away they threw, and to the hills \r(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven 640 \r\rOf pleasure situate in hill and dale) \rLight as the lightning-glimpse they ran, they flew; \rFrom their foundations loosening to and fro, \rThey plucked the seated hills, with all their load, \rRocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops \rUplifting bore them in their hands. Amaze, \rBe sure, and terror seized the rebel host, \rWhen coming towards them so dread they saw \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. 183 \r\rThe bottom of the mountains upward turned; \r\rTill on those cursed engines\' triple row 650 \r\rThey saw them whelmed, and all their confidence \r\rUnder the weight of mountains buried deep; \r\rThemselves invaded next, and on their heads \r\rMain promontories flung, which in the air \r\rCame shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed. \r\rTheir armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised \r\rInto their substance pent, which wrought them pain \r\rImplacable, and many a dolorous groan, \r\rLong struggling underneath, ere they could wind \r\rOut of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, 660 \r\rPurest at first, now gross by sinning grown. \r\rThe rest, in imitation, to like arms \r\rBetook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore ; \r\rSo hills amid the air encountered hills, \r\rHurled to and fro with jaculation dire, \r\rThat underground they fought in dismal shade; \r\rInfernal noise ! war seemed a civil game \r\rTo this uproar; horrid confusion heaped \r\rUpon confusion rose. And now all Heaven \r\rHad gone to wrack, with ruin overspread, 670 \r\rHad not the Almighty Father, where he sits \r\rShrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure, \r\rConsulting on the sum of things, foreseen \r\rThis tumult, and permitted all, advised, \r\rThat his great purpose he might so fulfil, \r\rTo honour his anointed Son, avenged \r\rUpon his enemies, and to declare \r\rAll power on him transferred : whence to his Son, \r\rThe assessor of his throne, he thus began : \r\r" \' Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved, 680 \r\rSon in whose face invisible is beheld \r\r\r\r184 PARADISE LOST, \r\rVisibly, what by Deity I am, \r\rAnd in whose hand what by decree I do, \r\rSecond Omnipotence ! two days are passed, \r\rTwo days, as we compute the days of Heaven, \r\rSince Michael and his powers went forth to tame \r\rThese disobedient. Sore hath been their fight, \r\rAs likeliest was when two such foes met armed ; \r\rFor to themselves I left them; and thou know\'st, \r\rEqual in their creation they were formed, 690 \r\rSave what sin hath impaired which yet hath wrought \r\rInsensibly, for I suspend their doom : \r\rWhence in perpetual fight they needs must last \r\rEndless, and no solution will be found. \r\rWar wearied hath performed what war can do, \r\rAnd to disordered rage let loose the reins, \r\rWith mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes \r\rWild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main. \r\rTwo days are, therefore, passed, the third is thine: \r\rFor thee I have ordained it, and thus far 700 \r\rHave suffered, that the glory may be thine \r\rOf ending this great war, since none but thou \r\rCan end it. Into thee such virtue and grace \r\rImmense I have transfused, that all may know \r\rIn Heaven and Hell thy power above compare; \r\rAnd this perverse commotion governed thus, \r\rTo manifest thee worthiest to be Heir \r\rOf all things to be Heir and to be King \r\rBy sacred unction, thy deserved right. \r\rGo, then, thou Mightiest, in thy Father\'s might; 710 \r\rAscend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels \r\rThat shake Heaven\'s basis; bring forth all my war, \r\rMy bow and thunder, my almighty arms \r\rGird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh ; \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. 185 \r\rPursue these Sons of Darkness, drive them out \rFrom all Heaven\'s bounds into the utter deep; \rThere let them learn, as likes them, to despise \rGod and Messiah his anointed King.\' \r\r" He said, and on his Son with rays direct \rShone full ; he all his Father full expressed 720 \r\rIneffably into his face received; \rAnd thus the Filial Godhead answering spake: \r\r" * O Father, O Supreme of Heavenly Thrones, \rFirst, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou always seek\'st \rTo glorify thy Son; I always thee, \rAs is most just. This I my glory account, \rMy exaltation, and my whole delight, \rThat thou in me well pleased declar\'st thy will \rFulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss. \rSceptre and power, thy giving, I assume, 730 \r\rAnd gladlier shall resign, when in the end \rThou shalt be all in all, and I in thee \rFor ever, and in ^ne all whom thou lov\'st : \rBut whom thou hat\'st I hate, and can put on \rThy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, \rImage of thee in all things; and shall soon, \rArmed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled, \rTo their prepared ill mansion driven down, \rTo chains of darkness and the undying worm, \rThat from thy just obedience could revolt, 740 \r\rWhom to obey is happiness entire. \rThen shall thy Saints, unmixed, and from the impure \rFar separate, circling thy holy mount, \rUnfeigned halleluiahs to thee sing, \rHymns of high praise, and I among them chief.\' \r\r"So said, he, o\'er his sceptre bowing, rose \rFrom the right hand of Glory where he sat; \r\r\r\r1 86 PARADISE LOST. \r\rAnd the third sacred morn began to shine, \r\rDawning through Heaven. Forth rushed with whirlwind \r\rsound \r\rThe chariot of Paternal Deity, 750 \r\rFlashing thick flames, wheel within wheel, undrawn, \rItself instinct with spirit, but convoyed \rBy four Cherubic shapes. Four faces each \rHad wondrous ; as with stars, their bodies all \rAnd wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels \rOf beryl, and careering fires between; \rOver their heads a crystal firmament, \rWhereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure \rAmber and colours of the showery arch. \rHe, in celestial panoply all armed 760 \r\rOf radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, \rAscended; at his right hand Victory \rSat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow \rAnd quiver with three-bolted thunder stored; \rAnd from about him fierce effusion rolled \rOf smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire. \rAttended with ten thousand thousand Saints, \rHe onward came ; far off his coming shone ; \rAnd twenty thousand (I their number heard) \rChariots of God, half on each hand, were seen. 770 \r\rHe on the wings of Cherub rode sublime \rOn the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned, \rIllustrious far and wide, but by his own \rFirst seen ; them unexpected joy surprised \rWhen the great ensign of Messiah blazed \rAloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven; \rUnder whose conduct Michael soon reduced \rHis army, circumfused on either wing, \rUnder their Head embodied all in one. \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. 187 \r\rBefore him Power Divine his way prepared; 780 \r\rAt his command the uprooted hills retired \r\rEach to his place; they heard his voice, and went \r\rObsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed, \r\rAnd with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled. \r\r"This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured, \rAnd to rebellious fight rallied their powers, \rInsensate, hope conceiving from despair. \rIn Heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? \rBut to convince the proud what signs avail, \rOr wonders move the obdurate to relent? 790 \r\rThey, hardened more by what might most reclaim, \rGrieving to see his glory, at the sight \rTook envy, and, aspiring to his highth, \rStood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud \rWeening to prosper, and at length prevail \rAgainst God and Messiah, or to fall \rIn universal ruin last; and now \rTo final battle drew, disdaining flight, \rOr faint retreat : when the great Son of God \rTo all his host on either hand thus spake : 800 \r\r"\' Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand, \rYe Angels armed; this day from battle rest. \rFaithful hath been your warfare, and of God \rAccepted, fearless in his righteous cause; \rAnd as ye have received, so have ye done, \rInvincibly. But of this cursed crew \rThe punishment to other hand belongs; \rVengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints : \rNumber to this day\'s work is not ordained, \rNor multitude ; stand only and behold 810 \r\rGod\'s indignation on these godless poured \rBy me; not you, but me, they have despised, \r\r\r\r1 88 PARADISE LOST. \r\rYet envied ; against me is all their rage, \r\rBecause the Father, to whom in Heaven supreme \r\rKingdom and power and glory appertains, \r\rHath honoured me, according to his will. \r\rTherefore to me their doom he hath assigned, \r\rThat they may have their wish, to try with me \r\rIn battle which the stronger proves they all, \r\rOr I alone against them; since by strength 820 \r\rThey measure all, of other excellence \r\rNot emulous, nor care who them excels ; \r\rNor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.\' \r\r"So spake the Son, and into terror changed * \rHis countenance, too severe to be beheld, \rAnd full of wrath bent on his enemies. \rAt once the Four spread out their starry wings \rWith dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs \rOf his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound \rOf torrent floods, or of a numerous host. 830 \r\rHe on his impious foes right onward drove, \rGloomy as night; under his burning wheels \rThe steadfast Empyrean shook throughout, \rAll but the throne itself of God. Full soon \rAmong them he arrived, in his right hand \rGrasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent \rBefore him, such as in their souls infixed \rPlagues; they, astonished, all resistance lost, \rAll courage; down their idle weapons dropt; \rO\'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode 840 \rOf Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, \rThat wished the mountains now might be again \rThrown on them, as a shelter from his ire. \rNor less on either side tempestuous fell \rHis arrows, from the fourfold- visaged Four, \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. 189 \r\rDistinct with eyes, and from the living wheels, \r\rDistinct alike with multitude of eyes ; \r\rOne spirit in them ruled, and every eye \r\rGlared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire \r\rAmong the accursed, that withered all their strength, 850 \r\rAnd of their wonted vigour left them drained, \r\rExhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen. \r\rYet half his strength he put not forth, but checked \r\rHis thunder in mid-volley; for he meant \r\rNot to destroy, but root them out of Heaven. \r\rThe overthrown he raised, and, as a herd \r\rOf goats or timorous flock together thronged, \r\rDrove them before him thunderstruck, pursued \r\rWith terrors and with furies to the bounds \r\rAnd crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide, 860 \r\rRolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed \r\rInto the wasteful deep. The monstrous sight \r\rStrook them with horror backward, but far worse \r\rUrged them behind ; headlong themselves they threw \r\rDown from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath \r\rBurned after them to the bottomless pit. \r\r" Hell heard the unsufferable noise ; Hell saw \rHeaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled \rAffrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep \rHer dark foundations, and too fast had bound. 870 \r\rNine days they fell; confounded Chaos roared, \rAnd felt tenfold confusion in their fall \rThrough his wild anarchy; so huge a rout \rEncumbered him with ruin. Hell at last, \rYawning, received them whole, and on them closed; \rHell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire \rUnquenchable, the house of woe and pain. \rDisburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. \r\rHer mural breach, returning whence it rolled. \r\rSole victor, from the expulsion of his foes 880 \r\rMessiah his triumphal chariot turned. \r\rTo meet him all his Saints, who silent stood \r\rEye-witnesses of his almighty acts, \r\rWith jubilee advanced; and as they went, \r\rShaded with branching palm, each order bright \r\rSung triumph, and him sung victorious King, \r\rSon, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given, \r\rWorthiest to reign. He, celebrated, rode \r\rTriumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts \r\rAnd temple of his mighty Father throned 890 \r\rOn high; who into glory him received, \r\rWhere now he sits at the right hand of bliss. \r\r" Thus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth, \rAt thy request, and that thou may\'st beware \rBy what is past, to thee I have revealed \rWhat might have else to human race been hid ; \rThe discord which befell, and war in Heaven \rAmong the angelic powers, and the deep fall \rOf those too high aspiring t who rebelled \rWith Satan : he who envies now thy state, 900 \r\rWho now is plotting how he may seduce \rThee also from obedience, that, with him \rBereaved of\'happiness, thou may\'st partake \rHis punishment, eternal misery; \rWhich would be all his solace and revenge, \rAs a despite done against the Most High, \rThee once to gain companion of his woe. \rBut listen not to his temptations ; warn \rThy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard, \rBy terrible example, the reward 910 \r\rOf disobedience. Firm they might have stood, \rYet fell ; remember, and fear to transgress." \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\rRaphael, at the request of Adam, relates how and wherefore this \rWorld was first created : that God, after the expelling of Satan and his \rAngels out of Heaven, declared his pleasure to create another World, and \rother creatures to dwell therein ; sends his Son with glory, and attendance \rof Angels, to perform the work of creation in six days: the Angels \rcelebrate with hymns the performance thereof, and his reascension into \rHeaven. \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. \r\r\r\rDESCEND from Heaven, Urania, by that name \rIf rightly thou art called, whose voice divine \rFollowing, above the Olympian hill I soar, \rAbove the flight of Pegasean wing! \rThe meaning, not the name, I call; for thou \rNor of the Muses nine, nor on the top \rOf old Olympus dwell\'st ; but Heavenly-born, ^ \rBefore the hills appeared or fountain flowed, \rThou with eternal Wisdom didst converse, \rWisdom thy sister, and with her didst play 10 \r\rIn presence of the Almighty Father, pleased \rWith thy celestial song. Up led by thee, \rInto the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed, \rAn earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air, \rThy tempering : with like safety guided down, \rReturn me to my native element; \rLest from this flying steed unreined (as once \rBellerophon, though from a lower clime) \rDismoTmted, on the Aleian field I fall, \rErroneous there to wander and forlorn. 20 \r\rHalf yet remains unsung, but narrower bound \rWithin the visible diurnal sphere. \r\rP. L. 13 \r\r\r\r194 PARADISE LOST. \r\rStanding on Earth, not rapt above the pole, \r\rMore safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged \r\rTo hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days, \r\rOn evil days though fallen, and evil tongues; \r\rIn darkness, and with dangers compassed round, \r\rAnd solitude; yet not alone, while thou \r\rVisit\'st my slumbers nightly, or when morn \r\rPurples the east. Still govern thou my song, 30 \r\rUrania, and fit audience find, though few; \r\rBut drive far off the barbarous dissonance \r\rOf Bacchus and his revellers, the race \r\rOf that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard \r\rIn Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears \r\rTo rapture, till the savage clamour drowned \r\rBoth harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend \r\rHer son. So fail not thou who thee implores; \r\rFor thou art Heavenly, she an empty dream. \r\rSay, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael, 40 \r\rThe affable Archangel, had forewarned \rAdam by dire example to beware \rApostasy, by what befell in Heaven \rTo those apostates, lest the like befall \rIn Paradise to Adam or his race, \rCharged not to touch the interdicted Tree, \rIf they transgress, and slight that sole command, \rSo easily obeyed amid the choice \rOf all tastes else to please their appetite, \rThough wandering. He with his consorted Eve 50 \r\rThe story heard attentive, and was filled \rWith admiration and deep muse, to hear \rOf things so high and strange, things to their thought \rSo unimaginable as hate in Heaven, \rAnd war so near the peace of God in bliss. \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. 195 \r\rWith such confusion ; but the evil, soon \r\rDriven back, redounded as a flood on those \r\rFrom whom it sprung, impossible to mix \r\rWith blessedness. Whence Adam soon repealed \r\rThe doubts that in his heart arose; and now 60 \r\rLed on, yet sinless, with desire to know \r\rWhat nearer might concern him, how this World \r\rOf Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began; \r\rWhen, and whereof, created; for what cause; \r\rWhat within Eden, or without, was done \r\rBefore his memory as one whose drouth \r\rYet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream, \r\rWhose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites - \r\rProceeded thus to ask his Heavenly guest: ^ \r\r" Great things, and full of wonder in our ears, 70 \r\rFar differing from this World, thou hast revealed, \rDivine interpreter! by favour sent \rDown from the Empyrean to forewarn \rUs timely of what might else have been our loss, \rUnknown, which human knowledge could not reach; \rFor which to the infinitely Good we owe \rImmortal thanks, and his admonishment \rReceive with solemn purpose to observe \rImmutably his sovran will, the end \r\rOf what we are. But, since thou hast vouchsafed 80 \rGently, for our instruction, to impart \rThings above earthly thought, which yet concerned \rOur knowing, as to highest Wisdom \rDeign to descend now lower, and relate \rWhat may no less perhaps avail us known : \rHow first began this heaven which we behold \rDistant so high, with moving fires adorned \rInnumerable; and this which yields or fills \r\r13 \r\r\r\r196 PARADISE LOST. \r\rAll space, the ambient air wide interfused, \r\rEmbracing round this florid Earth; what cause 90 \r\rMoved the Creator, in his holy rest \r\rThrough all eternity, so late to build \r\rIn Chaos; and the work begun how soon \r\rAbsolved ; if unforbid thou may\'st unfold \r\rWhat we not to explore the secrets ask \r\rOf his eternal empire, but the more \r\rTo magnify his works the more we know. \r\rAnd the great light of day yet wants to run \r\rMuch of his race, though steep; suspense in heaven, \r\rHeld by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears, 100 \r\rAnd longer will delay to hear thee tell \r\rHis generation, and the rising birth \r\rOf Nature from the unapparent Deep; \r\rOr if the star of evening and the moon \r\rHaste to thy audience, Night with her will bring \r\rSilence, and Sleep listening to thee will watch; \r\rOr we can bid his absence till thy song \r\rEnd, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine." \r\rThus Adam his illustrious guest besought; \rAnd thus the godlike Angel answered mild : 1 10 \r\r"This also thy request, with caution asked, \rObtain; though to recount almighty works \rWhat words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, \rOr heart of man suffice to comprehend? \rYet what thou canst attain, which best may serve \rTo glorify the Maker, and infer \rThee also happier, shall not be withheld \rThy hearing; such commission from above \rI have received, to answer thy desire \rOf knowledge within bounds ; beyond abstain 120 \r\rTo ask, nor let thine own inventions hope \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. \r\r\r\r197 \r\r\r\rThings not revealed, which the invisible King, \r\rOnly omniscient, hath suppressed in night, \r\rTo none communicable in Earth or Heaven : \r\rEnough is left besides to search and know. \r\rBut knowledge is as food, and needs no less \r\rHer temperance over appetite, to know \r\rIn measure what the mind may well contain; \r\rOppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns \r\rWisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind. 130 \r\r"Know then that after Lucifer from Heaven \r(So call him, brighter once amidst the host \rOf Angels than that star the stars among) \rFell with his flaming legions through the Deep \rInto his place, and the great Son returned \rVictorious with his Saints, the omnipotent \rEternal Father from his throne beheld \rTheir multitude, and to his Son thus spake : \r\r"\'At least our envious foe hath failed, who thought \rAll like himself rebellious ; by whose aid 140 \r\rThis inaccessible high strength, the seat \rOf Deity supreme, us dispossessed, \rHe trusted to have seized, and into fraud \rDrew many whom their place knows here no more : \rYet far the greater part have kept, I see, \rTheir station ; Heaven, yet populous, retains \rNumber sufficient to possess her realms \rThough wide, and this high temple to frequent \rWith ministeries due and solemn rites. \rBut lest his heart exalt him in the harm 150 \r\rAlready done, to have dispeopled Heaven \rMy damage fondly deemed I can repair \rThat detriment, if such it be to lose \rSelf-lost, and in a moment will create \r\r\r\r198 PARADISE LOST. \r\r| Another world, out of one man a race \rj| Of men innumerable, there to dwell, \rv Not here, till, by degrees of merit raised, \r\rThey open to themselves at length the way \r\rUp hither, under long obedience tried, \r\rAnd Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth, 160 \r\rOne kingdom, joy and union without end. \r\rMeanwhile inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven; \r\rAnd thou, my Word, begotten Son, by thee \r\rThis I perform ; speak thou, and be it done ! \r\rMy overshadowing Spirit and might with thee \r\rI send along ; ride forth, and bid the Deep \r\rWithin appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth; \r\rBoundless the Deep, because I am who fill \r\rInfinitude; nor vacuous the space, \r\rThough I uncircumscribed myself retire, 170 \r\rAnd put not forth my goodness, which is free \r\rTo act or not : Necessity and Chance \r\rApproach not me, and what I will is Fate.\' \r\r"So spake the Almighty, and to what he spake \r\rHis Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. \r\rImmediate are the acts of God, more swift \r\rThan time or motion, but to human ears \r\rCannot without process of speech be told, \r\rSo told as earthly notion can receive. \r\rGreat triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven, 180 \r\rWhen such was heard declared the Almighty\'s will; \r\rGlory they sung to the Most High, good-will \r\rTo future men, and in their dwellings peace; \r\rGlory to Him whose just avenging ire \r\rHad driven out the ungodly from his sight \r\rAnd the habitations of the just; to Him \r\rGlory and praise whose wisdomJiad ordained \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. 199 \r\rGood out of evil to create; instead \r\rOf""pirits malign, a better race to bring \r1 Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse 190 \r\rI His good to worlds and ages infinite. \r\r"So sang the Hierarchies. Meanwhile the Son \r\rOn his great expedition now appeared, \rf*Girt with omnipotence, with radiance crowned \r\\^Of majesty divine, sapience and love \r\rImmense; and all his Father in him shone. \r\rAbout his chanoT~numberless wefe poured \r\rCherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, \r\rAnd Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged \r\rFrom the armoury of God, where stand of old 200 \r\rMyriads, between two brazen mountains lodged \r\rAgainst a solemn day, harnessed at hand, \r\rCelestial equipage; and now came forth \r\rSpontaneous, for within them Spirit lived, \r\rAttendant on their Lord. Heaven opened wide \r\rHer ever-during gates, harmonious sound \r\rOn golden hinges moving, to let forth \r\rThe King of Glory, in his powerful Word \r\rAnd Spirit coming to create new worlds. \r\rOn Heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore 210 \r\rThey viewed the vast immeasurable Abyss, \r\rOutrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild, \r\rUp from the bottom turned by furious winds \r\rAnd surging waves, as mountains, to assault \r\rHeaven\'s highth, and with the centre mix the pole. \r" * Silence, ye troubled waves, and, thou Deep, peace ! \' \r\rSaid then the omnific Word : \' your discord end ! \' \r\rNor stayed; but, on the wings of Cherubim \r\rUplifted, in paternal glory rode \r\rFar into Chaos and the World unborn; 220 \r\r\r\r200 PARADISE LOST. \r\rFor Chaos heard his voice. Him all his train \rFollowed in bright procession, to behold \rCreation, and the wonders of his might. \rThen stayed the fervid wheels and in his hand \rHe took the golden compasses, prepared \rIn God\'s eternal store, to circumscribe \rThis Universe, and all created things. \rOne foot he centred, and the other turned \rRound through the vast profundity obscure, \rAnd said, \' Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds ; 230 \rThis be thy just circumference, O World ! \' \rThus God the heaven created, thus the Earth, \rMatter unformed and void. Darkness profound \rCovered the Abyss; but on the watery calm \rHis brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread, \rAnd vital virtue infused, and vital warmth, \rThroughout the fluid mass, but downward purged \rThe black, tartareous, cold, infernal dregs, \rAdverse to life; then founded, then conglobed \rLike things to like, the rest to several place 240 \r\rDisparted, and between spun out the air, \rAnd Earth, self-balanced, on her centre hung. \r/" "\'Let there be light!\' said God; and forthwith light \r/ Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure, \r\rSprung from the Deep, and from her native east \r\rTo journey through the aery gloom began, \r\rSphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun \r\rWas not; she in a cloudy tabernacle \r\rSojourned the while. God saw the light was good ; \r\rAnd light from darkness by the hemisphere 250 \r\rDivided : light the Day, and darkness Night, \r\rHe named. Thus was the first day even and morn; \r\rNor passed uncelebrated, nor unsung \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. 201 \r\rBy the celestial quires, when orient light \r\rExhaling first from darkness they beheld, \r\rBirth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout \r\rThe hollow universal orb they filled, \r\rAnd touched their golden harps, and hymning praised \r\rGod and his works; Creator him they sung, \r\rBoth when first evening was, and when first morn. 260 \r\r"Again, God said, \'Let there be firmament \rAmid the waters, and let it divide \rThe waters from the waters ! \' And God made \rThe firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, \rTransparent, elemental air, diffused \rIn circuit to the uttermost convex \rOf this great round partition firm and sure, \rThe waters underneath from those above \rDividing; for as Earth, so he the World \rBuilt on circumfluous waters calm, in wide 270 \r\rCrystalline ocean, and the loud misrule \rOf Chaos far removed, lest fierce extremes \rContiguous might distemper the whole frame : \rAnd heaven he named the firmament. So even \rAnd morning chorus sung the second day. \r\r"The Earth was formed, but, in the womb as yet \rOf waters, embryon, immature, involved, \rAppeared not; over all the face of Earth \rMain ocean flowed, not idle, but, with warm \rProlific humour softening all her globe, 280 \r\rFermented the great mother to conceive, \rSatiate with genial moisture; when God said, \r\'Be gathered now, ye waters under heaven, \rInto one place, and let dry land appear!\' \rImmediately the mountains huge appear \rEmergent, and their broad bare backs upheave \r\r\r\r202 PARADISE LOST. \r\rInto the clouds ; their tops ascend the sky. \r\rSo high as heaved the tumid hills, so low \r\rDown sunk a hollow bottom, broad and deep, \r\rCapacious bed of waters; thither they 290 \r\rHasted with glad precipitance, uprolled, \r\rAs drops on dust conglobing from the dry; \r\rPart rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct, \r\rFor haste; such flight the great command impressed \r\rOn the swift floods. As armies at the call \r\rOf trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard) \r\rTroop to the standard, so the watery throng, \r\rWave rolling after wave, where way they found : \r\rIf steep, with torrent rapture, \' if through plain, \r\rSoft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill; 300 \r\rBut they, or underground, or circuit wide \r\rWith serpent error wandering, found their way, \r\rAnd on the washy ooze deep channels wore; \r\rEasy, ere God had bid the ground be dry, \r\rAll but within those banks where rivers now \r\rStream, and perpetual draw their humid train. \r\rThe dry land Earth, and the great receptacle \r\rOf congregated waters he called seas; \r\rAnd saw that it was good, and said, \'Let the Earth \r\rPut forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed, 310 \r\rAnd fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind, \r\rWhose seed is in herself upon the Earth ! \' \r\rHe scarce had said when the bare Earth, till then \r\rDesert and bare, unsightly, unadorned, \r\rBrought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad \r\rHer universal face with pleasant green ; \r\rThen herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered, \r\rOpening their various colours, and made gay \r\rHer bosom, smelling sweet; and, these scarce blown, \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. 203 \r\rForth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept 320 \rThe smelling gourd, up stood the corny reed \rEmbattled in her field: add the humble shrub, \rAnd bush with frizzled hair implicit : last \rRose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread \rTheir branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed \rTheir blossoms. With high woods the hills were crowned, \rWith tufts the valleys and each fountain-side, \rWith borders long the rivers; that Earth now \rSeemed like to Heaven, a seat where gods might dwell, \rOr wander with delight, and love to haunt . 330 \r\rHer sacred shades; though God had yet not rained \rUpon the Earth, and man to till the ground \rNone was, but from the Earth a dewy mist \rWent up and watered all the ground, and each \rPlant of the field, which ere it was in the Earth \rGod made, and every herb, before it grew \rOn the green stem. God saw that it was good; \rSo even and morn recorded the third day. \rI " Again the Almighty .spake, \' Let there be lights \ri High in the expanse of heaven, to divide 340 \r\rThe day from night; and let them be for signs, \rFor seasons, and for days, and circling years; \rAnd let them be for lights, as I ordain \rTheir office in the firmament of heaven, \rTo give light on the Earth ! \' and it was so. \rAnd God made two great lights, great for their use \rTo Man, the greater to have rule by day, \rThe less by night, altern; and made the stars, \rAnd set them in the firmament of heaven \rTo illuminate the Earth, and rule the day 350 \r\rIn their vicissitude, and rule the night, \rAnd light from darkness to divide. God saw, \r\r\r\r204 PARADISE LOST. \r\rSurveying his great work, that it was good : \r\rFor, of celestial bodies, first the sun \r\rA mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first, \r\rThough of ethereal mould; then formed the moon \r\rGlobose, and every magnitude of stars, \r\rAnd sowed with stars the heaven thick as a field. \r\rOf light by far the greater part he took, \r\rTransplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed 360 \r\rIn the sun\'s orb, made porous to receive \r\rAnd drink the liquid light, firm to retain \r\rHer gathered beams, great palace now of light. \r\rHither, as to their fountain, other stars \r\rRepairing, in their golden urns draw light, \r\rAnd hence the morning planet gilds her horns; \r\rBy tincture or reflection they augment \r\rTheir small peculiar, though, from human sight \r\rSo far remote, with diminution seen. \r\rFirst in his east the glorious lamp was seen, 370 \r\rRegent of day, and all the horizon round \r\rInvested with bright rays, jocund to run \r\rHis longitude through heaven\'s high road; the grey \r\rDawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced, \r\rShedding sweet influence. Less bright the moon, \r\rBut opposite in levelled west, was set, \r\rHis mirror, with full face borrowing her light \r\rFrom him; for other light she needed none \r\rIn that aspect, and still that distance keeps \r\rTill night; then in the east her turn she shines, 380 \r\rRevolved on heaven\'s great axle, and her reign \r\rWith thousand lesser lights dividual holds, \r\rWith thousand thousand stars, that then appeared \r\rSpangling the hemisphere. Then first adorned \r\rWith her bright luminaries, that set and rose, \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. 205 \r\rGlad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day. \r\r" And God said, \' Let the waters generate \rReptile with spawn abundant, living soul ; \rAnd let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings \rDisplayed on the open firmament of heaven ! \' 390 \r\rAnd God created the great whales, and each \rSoul living, each that crept, which plenteously \rThe waters generated by their kinds, \rAnd every bird of wing after his kind; \rAnd saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying, \r\'Be fruitful, multiply, and in the seas, \rAnd lakes, and running streams, the waters fill; \rAnd let the fowl be multiplied on the Earth ! \' \rForthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay, \rWith fry innumerable swarm, and shoals 400 \r\rOf fish that with their fins and shining scales \rGlide under the green wave in sculls that oft \rBank the mid-sea. Part, single or with mate, \rGraze the sea-weed, their pasture, and through groves \rOf coral stray, or, sporting with quick glance, \rShow to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold; \rOr, in their pearly shells at ease, attend \rMoist nutriment, or under rocks their food \rIn jointed armour watch; on smooth the seal \rAnd bended dolphins play; part, huge of bulk, 410 \r\rWallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait, \rTempest the ocean. There leviathan, \rHugest of living creatures, on the deep \rStretched like a promontory, sleeps or swims, \rAnd seems a moving land, and at his gills \rDraws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea. \rMeanwhile the tepid caves, and fens, and shores, \rTheir brood as numerous hatch from the egg, that soon, \r\r\r\r206 PARADISE LOST. \r\rBursting with kindly rupture, forth disclosed \rTheir callow young ; but feathered soon and fledge 420 \rThey summed their pens, and, soaring the air sublime, \rWith clang despised the ground, under a cloud \rIn prospect. There the eagle and the stork \rOn cliffs and cedar-tops their eyries build. \rPart loosely wing the region ; part more wise, \rIn common, ranged in figure, wedge their way, \rIntelligent of seasons, and set forth \rTheir aery caravan, high over seas \rFlying, and over lands, with mutual wing \rEasing their flight; so steers the prudent crane 430 \r\rHer annual voyage, borne on winds; the air \rFloats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes. \rFrom branch to branch the smaller birds with song \rSolaced the woods, and spread their painted wings, \rTill even; nor then the solemn nightingale \rCeased warbling, but all night tuned her soft lays. \rOthers, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed \rTheir downy breast; the swan, with arched neck \rBetween her white wings mantling proudly, rows \rHer state with oary feet; yet oft they quit 440 \r\rThe dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower \rThe mid aerial sky. Others on ground \rWalked firm : the crested cock whose clarion sounds \rThe silent hours, and the other whose gay train \rAdorns him, coloured with the florid hue \rI Of rainbows and starry eyes. The waters thus \rIWith fish replenished, and the air with fowl, \r^Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day. \r\r"The sixth, and of Creation last, arose \rWith evening harps and matin ; when God said, 450 \r\r\'Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind, \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. 207 \r\r, Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth, \rEach in their kind ! \' The Earth obeyed, and straight, \rOpening her fertile womb, teemed at a birth \r\' Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms, \rLimbed and full-grown. Out of the ground up rose, \rAs from his lair, the wild beast, where he wons \rIn forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den; \rAmong the trees in pairs they rose, they walked; \rThe cattle in the fields and meadows green : 460 \r\rThose rare and solitary, these in flocks \rPasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung. \rThe grassy clods now calved; now half appeared \rThe tawny lion, pawing to get free \rHis hinder parts, then springs, as broke from bonds. \rAnd rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce, \rThe libbard, and the tiger, as the mole \rRising, the crumbled earth above them threw \rIn hillocks; the swift stag from underground \rBore up his branching head ; scarce from his mould 470 \rBehemoth, biggest born .of earth, upheaved \rHis vastness; fleeced the flocks and bleating rose, \rAs plants ; ambiguous between sea and land, \rThe river-horse and scaly crocodile. \rAt once came forth whatever creeps the ground, \rInsect or worm. Those waved their limber fans \rFor wings, and smallest lineaments exact \rIn all the liveries decked of summer\'s pride, \rWith spots of gold and purple, azure and green ; \rThese as a line their long dimension drew, 480 \r\rStreaking the ground with sinuous trace : not all \rMinims of nature; some of serpent kind, \rWondrous in length and corpulence, involved \rTheir snaky folds, and added wings. First crept \r\r\r\r208 PARADISE LOST. \r\rThe parsimonious emmet, provident \r\rOf future, in small room large heart enclosed; \r\rPattern of just equality perhaps \r\rHereafter, joined in her popular tribes \r\rOf commonalty. Swarming next appeared \r\rThe female bee, that feeds her husband drone 490 \r\rDeliciously, and builds her waxen cells \r\rWith honey stored. The rest are numberless, \r\rAnd thou their natures know\'st, and gav\'st them names, \r\rNeedless to thee repeated; nor unknown \r\rThe serpent, subtlest beast of all the field, \r\rOf huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes \r\rAnd hairy mane terrific, though to thee \r\rNot noxious, but obedient at thy call. \r\r"Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled \rHer motions, as the great First Mover\'s hand 500 \r\rFirst wheeled their course; Earth in her rich attire \rConsummate lovely smiled ; air, water, earth, \rBy fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked, \rFrequent; and of the sixth day yet remained. \rThere wanted yet the master-work, the end \rOf all yet done ; a creature who, not prone \rAnd brute as other creatures, but endued \rWith sanctity of reason, might erect \rHisstature, and upright with front serene \rQovern the rest, selfJmowjng, and from thence 510 \r\rMagnanimous to correspond with Heaven, \r\riteful to acknowledge whence his good \rinds; thither with heart, and voice, and eyes, \rDirected in devotion, to adore \rAnd worship God supreme, who made him chief \rOf all his works. Therefore the omnipotent \rEternal Father (for where is not he \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. 209 \r\rPresent ?) thus to his Son audibly spake : \r\r" \' Let us make now Man in our image, Man \r\rIn our similitude, and let them rule 520 \r\rjOver the fish and fowl of sea and air, \r1 Beast of the field, and over all the Earth, \r\rAnd every creeping thing that creeps the ground! \r\rThis said, he_ formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man, \r\rDust j)f the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed \r\rThe breath of life ; in Jtus._Qwn image he \r\rCreated thee, in the image of God \r\rExpress, and thou becanVst a. living soul. \r\rMale he created thee, but thy consort \r\rFemalegforrace ; then blessed mankind, and said, 530 \r\r* BefruiSuIfmultiply, and fill the Earth; \r\rSubdue it, and throughout dominion hold \r\rOver fish of the sea, and fowl of the air, \r\rAnd every living thing that moves on the Earth ! \' \r\rWherever thus created (for no place \r\rIs yet distinct by name), thence, as thou know\'st, \r\rHe brought thee into this delicious grove, \r\rThis garden, planted with the trees of God, \r\rDelectable both to behold and taste ; \r\rAnd freely all their pleasant fruit for food 540 \r\rGave thee : all sorts are here that all the Earth yields, \r\rVariety without end; but of the Tree \r\rWhichjasted works -knowledge of good and evil \r\rThou may*striQt^ in the day__jfchou eat!t, than diest;. \r\rDeath is fHe^penalty imposed; beware, \r\rAnd govern well thy appetite, lest. Sin \r\rSurprise thee, and her black attendant, Death. \r"Here finished he, and all that he had made \r\rViewed, and behold ! all was entirely good. \r\rSo even and morn accomplished the sixth day; 550 \r\rP. L. \r\r\r\r2IO PARADISE LOST. \r\rYet not till the Creator, from his work \rDesisting, though unwearied, up returned, \rUp to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode, \rThence to behold this new-created World, \rThe addition of his empire how it showed \rIn prospect from his throne, how good, how fair, \rAnswering his great idea. Up he rode, \rFollowed with acclamation and the sound \rSymphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned \rAngelic harmonies. The Earth, the air 560 \r\rResounded (thou remember\'st, for thou heard\'st), \rjThe heavens and all the constellations rung, \rThe planets in their stations listening stood, \rWhile the bright pomp ascended jubilant. \r* Open, ye everlasting gates ! \' they sung ; \r\' Open, ye Heavens, your living doors ! let in \rThe great Creator, from his work returned \rMagnificent, his six days\' work, a World ! \rOpen, and henceforth oft; for God will deign \rTo visit oft the dwellings of just men, 570 \r\rDelighted, and with frequent intercourse \rThither will send his winged messengers \rOn errands of supernal grace.\' So sung \rThe glorious train ascending. He through Heaven, \rThat opened wide her blazing portals, led \rTo God\'s eternal house direct the way; \rA broad and ample road, whose dust is gold, \rAnd pavement stars, as stars to thee appear \rSeen in the Galaxy, that milky way \rWhich nightly as a circling zone thou seest 580 \r\rPowdered with stars. And now on Earth the seventh \rEvening arose in Eden, for the sun \rWas set, and twilight from the east came on, \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. 211 \r\rForerunning night ; when at the holy mount \r\rOf Heaven\'s high-seated top, the imperial throne \r\rOf Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure, \r\rThe Filial Power arrived, and sat him down \r\rWith his great Father; for he also went \r\rInvisible, yet stayed (such privilege \r\rHath Omnipresence), and the work ordained, 590 \r\rAuthor and end of all things, and, from work \r\rNow resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day, \r\rAs resting on that day from all his work; \r\rBut not in silence holy kept : the harp \r\rHad work and rested not; the solemn pipe, \r\rAnd dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop, \r\rAll sounds on fret by string or golden wire, \r\rTempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice \r\rChoral or unison; of incense clouds, \r\rFuming from golden censers, hid the mount. 600 \r\rCreation and the six days\' acts they sung : \r\r* Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite \r\rThy power ! what thought can measure thee, or tongue \r\rRelate thee? greater now in thy return \r\rThan from the Giant-angels : thee that day \r\rThy thunders magnified ; but to create \r\rIs greater than created to destroy. \r\rWho can impair thee, mighty King, or bound \r\rThy empire? Easily the proud attempt \r\rOf Spirits apostate and their counsels vain 610 \r\rThou hast repelled, while impiously they thought \r\rThee to diminish, and from thee withdraw \r\rThe number of thy worshippers. Who seeks \r\rTo lessen thee, against his purpose serves \r\rTo manifest the more thy might; his evil \r\rThou usest, and from thence creat\'st more good. \r\r142 \r\r\r\r212 PARADISE LOST. \r\rWitness this new-made World, another Heaven \r\rFrom Heaven-gate not far, founded in view \r\rOn the clear hyaline, the glassy sea; \r\rOf amplitude almost immense, with stars 620 \r\rNumerous, and every star perhaps a world \r\rOf destined habitation; but thou know\'st \r\rTheir seasons; among these the seat of Men, \r\rEarth, with her nether ocean circumfused, \r\rTheir pleasant dwelling-place. Thrice happy Men, \r\rAnd sons of Men! whom God hath thus advanced, \r\rCreated in his image, there to dwell \r\rAnd worship him, and in reward to rule \r\rOver his works, on earth, in sea, or air, \r\rAnd multiply a race of worshippers 630 \r\rHoly and just; thrice happy, if they know \r\rTheir happiness, and persevere upright ! \' \r\r"So sung they, and the Empyrean rung \rWith halleluiahs. Thus was Sabbath kept. \rAnd thy request think now fulfilled, that asked \rHow first this World and face of things began, \rAnd what before thy memory was done \rFrom the beginning, that posterity, \rInformed by thee, might know. If else thou seek\'st \rAught, not surpassing human measure, say." 640 \r\r\r\rBOOK VIII, \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\rAdam inquires concerning celestial motions ; is doubtfully answered, \rand exhorted to search rather things more worthy of knowledge. \rAdam assents, and, still desirous to detain Raphael, relates to him \rwhat he remembered since his own creation : his placing in Paradise ; \rhis talk with God concerning solitude and fit society; his first meeting \rand nuptials with Eve. His discourse with the Angel thereupon; who, \rafter admonitions repeated, departs. \r\r\r\r\r\r\rBOOK VIII. \r\r\r\rTHE Angel ended, and in Adam\'s ear \rSo charming left his voice that he a while \rThought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear; \rThen, as new-waked, thus gratefully replied : \r\r"What thanks sufficient, or what recompense \rEqual, have I to render thee, divine \rHistorian, who thus largely hast allayed \rThe thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed \rThis friendly condescension to relate \rThings else by me unsearchable, now heard \rWith wonder, but delight, and, as is due, \rWith glory attributed to the high \rCreator? Something yet of doubt remains, \rWhich only thy solution can resolve. \rWhen I behold this goodly frame, this World \rOf Heaven and Earth consisting, and compute \rTheir magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain, \rAn atom, with the firmament compared \rAnd all her numbered stars, that seem to roll \rSpaces incomprehensible (for such 20 \r\rTheir distance argues, and their swift return \rDiurnal) merely to officiate light \r\r\r\r\r2l6 PARADISE LOST. \r\rRound this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, \r\rOne day and night, in all their vast survey \r\rUseless besides; reasoning I oft admire \r\rHow Nature, wise and frugal, could commit \r\rSuch disproportions, with superfluous hand \r\rSo many nobler bodies to create, \r\rGreater so manifold, to this one use, \r\rFor aught appears, and on their orbs impose 30 \r\rSuch restless revolution day by day \r\rRepeated, while the sedentary Earth, \r\rThat better might with far less compass move, \r\rServed by more noble than herself, attains \r\rHer end without least motion, and receives, \r\rAs tribute, such a sumless journey brought \r\rOf incorporeal speed, her warmth and light : \r\rSpeed, to describe whose swiftness number fails." ^ \r\rSo spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed \rEntering on studious thoughts abstruse ; which Eve 40 \rPerceiving, where she sat retired in sight, \rWith lowliness majestic from her seat, \rAnd grace that won who saw to wish her stay, \rRose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers, \rTo visit how they prospered, bud and bloom, \rHer nursery; they at her coming sprung, \rAnd, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew. \rYet went she not as not with such discourse \rDelighted, or not capable her ear \r\rOf what was high : such pleasure she reserved, 50 \r\rAdam relating, she sole auditress; \rHer husband the relater she preferred \rBefore the Angel, and of him to ask \rChose rather; he, she knew, would intermix \rGrateful digressions, and solve high dispute \r\r\r\rBOOK VIII. 217 \r\rWith conjugal caresses : from his lip \r\rNot words alone pleased her. Oh, when meet now \r\rSuch pairs, in love and mutual honour joined? \r\rWith goddess-like demeanour forth she went, \r\rNot unattended; for on her as queen 60 \r\rA pomp of winning Graces waited still, \r\rAnd from about her shot darts of desire \r\rInto all eyes, to wish her still in sight. \r\rAnd Raphael now to Adam\'s doubt proposed \r\rBenevolent and facile thus replied : \r\r"To ask or search I blame thee not; for heaven \rIs as the Book of God before thee set, \rWherein to read his wondrous works, and learn \rHis seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years: \rThis to attain, whether heaven move or Earth 70 \r\rImports not, if thou reckon right; the rest \rFrom Man or Angel the great Architect \rDid wisely to conceal, and not divulge \rHis secrets, to be scanned by them who ought \rRather admire. Or if they list to try \rConjecture, he his fabric of the heavens \rHath left to their disputes, perhaps to move \rHis laughter at their quaint opinions wide \rHereafter, when they come to model heaven, \rAnd calculate the stars; how they will wield 80 \r\rThe mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive, \rTo save appearances; how gird the sphere \rWith centric and eccentric scribbled o\'er, \rCycle and epicycle, orb in orb. \rAlready by thy reasoning this I guess, \rWho art to lead thy offspring, and supposest \rThat bodies bright and greater should not serve \rThe less not bright, nor heaven such journeys run, \r\r\r\r218 PARADISE LOST. \r\rEarth sitting still, when she alone receives \r\rThe benefit. Consider, first, that great 90 \r\rOr bright infers not excellence : the Earth, \r\rThough, in comparison of heaven, so small, \r\rNor glistering, may of solid good contain \r\rMore plenty than the sun that barren shines, \r\rWhose virtue on itself works no effect, \r\rBut in the fruitful Earth; there first received, \r\rHis beams, unactive else, their vigour find. \r\rYet not to Earth are those bright luminaries \r\rOfficious, but to thee, Earth\'s habitant. \r\rAnd for the heaven\'s wide circuit, let it speak 100 \r\rThe Maker\'s high magnificence, who built \r\rSo spacious, and his line stretched out so far, \r\rThat Man may know he dwells not in his own ; \r\rAn edifice too large for him to fill, \r\rLodged in a small partition, and the rest \r\rOrdained for uses to his Lord best known. \r\rThe swiftness of those circles attribute, \r\rThough numberless, to his omnipotence, \r\rThat to corporeal substances could add \r\rSpeed almost spiritual. Me thou think\'st not slow, no \r\rWho since the morning-hour set out from Heaven \r\rWhere God resides, and ere mid-day arrived \r\rIn Eden, distance inexpressible \r\rBy numbers that have name. But this I urge, \r\rAdmitting motion in the heavens, to show \r\rInvalid that which thee to doubt it moved; \r\rNot that I so affirm, though so it seem \r\rTo thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. \r\rGod, to remove his ways from human sense, \r\rPlaced heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight, 120 \r\rIf it presume, might err in things too high, \r\r\r\rBOOK VIII. 219 \r\rAnd no advantage gain. What if the sun \r\rBe centre to the World, and other stars, \r\rBy his attractive virtue and their own \r\rIncited, dance about him various rounds? \r\rTheir wandering course, now high, now low, then hid, \r\rProgressive, retrograde, or standing still, \r\rIn six thou seest; and what if seventh to these \r\rThe planet Earth, so steadfast though she seem, \r\rInsensibly three different motions move ? 130 \r\rWhich else to several spheres thou must ascribe, \r\rMoved contrary with thwart obliquities, \r\rOr save the sun his labour, and that swift \r\rNocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed, \r\rInvisible else above all stars, the wheel \r\rOf day and night ; which needs not thy belief, \r\rIf Earth, industrious of herself, fetch day, \r\rTravelling east, and with her part averse \r\rFrom the sun\'s beam meet night, her other part \r\rStill luminous by his ray. What if that light, 140 \r\rSent from her through the wide transpicuous air, \r\rTo the terrestrial moon be as a star, \r\rEnlightening her by day, as she by night \r\rThis Earth reciprocal, if land be there, \r\rFields and inhabitants? Her spots thou seest \r\rAs clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce \r\rFruits in her softened soil, for some to eat \r\rAllotted there; and other suns, perhaps, \r\rWith their attendant moons, thou wilt descry, \r\rCommunicating male and female light, 150 \r\rWhich two great sexes animate the World, \r\rStored in each orb perhaps with some that live. \r\rFor such vast room in Nature unpossessed \r\rBy living soul, desert and desolate, \r\r\r\r22O PARADISE LOST. \r\rOnly to shine, yet scarce to contribute \r\rEach orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far \r\rDown to this habitable, which returns \r\rLight back to them, is obvious to dispute. \r\rBut whether thus these things, or whether not \r\rWhether the sun, predominant in heaven, 160 \r\rRise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the sun; \r\rHe from the east his flaming road begin, \r\rOr she from west her silent course advance \r\rWith inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps \r\rOn her soft axle, while she paces even, \r\rAnd bears thee soft with the smooth air along \r\rSolicit not thy thoughts with matters hid : \r\rLeave them to God above; him serve and fear. \r\rOf other creatures, as him pleases best, \r\rWherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou 170 \r\rIn what he gives to thee, this Paradise \r\rAnd thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high \r\rTo know what passes there ; be lowly wise ; \r\rThink only what concerns thee and thy being; \r\rDream not of other worlds, what creatures there \r\rLive, in what state, condition, or degree; \r\rContented that thus far hath been revealed \r\rNot of Earth only, but of highest Heaven." \r\rTo whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied: - \r"How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure 180 \r\rIntelligence of Heaven, Angel serene, \rAnd, freed from intricacies, taught to live \rThe easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts \rTo interrupt the sweet of life, from which \rGod hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares, \rAnd not molest us, unless we ourselves \rSeek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain. \r\r\r\r\rBOOK VIII. 221 \r\rBut apt the mind or fancy is to rove \r\rUnchecked ; and of her roving is no end, \r\rTill warned, or by experience taught, she learn 190 \r\rThat not to know at large of things remote \r\rFrom use, obscure and subtle, but to know \r\rThat which before us lies in daily life, \r\rIs the prime wisdom : what is more is fume, \r\rOr emptiness, or fond impertinence, \r\rAnd renders us in things that most concern \r\rUnpractised, unprepared, and still to seek. \r\r*~ Therefore from this high pitch let us descend \rA lower flight, and speak of things at hand \rUsefulj) whence haply mention may arise *~ "*" 200 \rOfsomething not unseasonable to ask, \rBy sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned. \rThee I have heard relating what was done \rEre my remembrance; now hear me relate \rMy story, which perhaps thou hast not heard. \rAnd day is yet not spent jj till L then thou seest \rHow subtly to detain thee I devise, \rInviting thee to hear while I relate \r\rJFond, were it not in hope of thy repf^T^ \r\rI For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven; 210 \r\rAnd sweeter thy discourse is to my ear \rThan fruits of palm-tree, pleasantest to thirst \rAnd hunger both, from labour, at the hour \rOf sweet repast : they satiate, and soon fill, \rThough pleasant ; but thy words, with grace divine \rImbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety."_J \r\rTo whom thus Raphael answered, Heavenly meek: \r"Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of Men, \rNor tongue ineloquent ; for God on thee \rAbundantly his gifts hath also poured, 220 \r\r\r\r222 PARADISE LOST. \r\rInward and outward both, his image fair: \r\rSpeaking or mute, all comeliness and grace \r\rAttends thee, and each word, each motion, forms. \r\rNor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth \r\rThan of our fellow-servant, and inquire \r\rGladly into the ways of God with Man ; \r\rFor God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set \r\rOn Man his equal love. Say therefore on; \r\rFor I that day was absent, as befell, \r\rBound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, 230 \r\rFar on excursion toward the gates of Hell, \r\rSquared in full legion (such command we had), \r\rTo see that none thence issued forth a spy \r\rOr enemy, while God was in his work; \r\rLest he, incensed at such eruption bold, \r\rDestruction with Creation might have mixed: \r\rNot that they durst without his leave attempt; \r\rBut us he sends upon his high behests \r\rFor state, as sovran King, and to inure- \r\rOur prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut, 240 \r\rThe dismal gates, and barricadoed strong; \r\rBut, long ere our approaching, heard within \r\rNoise, other than the sound of dance or song; \r\rTorment, and loud lament, and furious rage. \r\rGlad we returned up to the coasts of light \r\rEre Sabbath-evening; so we had in charge. \r\rBut thy relation now; for I attend, \r\rPleased with thy words no less than thou with mine," \r\rSo spake the godlike Power, and thus our sire: \r"For Man to tell how human life began 250 \r\rIs hard; for who himself beginning knew? \rDesire with thee still longer to converse \rInduced me. As new-waked from soundest sleep, \r\r\r\rBOOK VIII. 223 \r\rSoft on the flowery herb I found me laid, \r\rIn balmy sweat, which with his beams the sun \r\rSoon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed. \r\rStraight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned, \r\rAnd gazed a while the ample sky, till raised \r\rBy quick instinctive motion up I sprung, \r\rAs thitherward endeavouring, and upright 260 \r\rStood on my feet. About me round I saw \r\rHill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains, \r\rAnd liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these, \r\rCreatures that lived and moved, and walked or flew, \r\rBirds on the branches warbling ; all things smiled ; \r\rWith fragrance and with joy my heart o\'erflowed. \r\rMyself I then perused, and limb by limb \r\rSurveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran \r\rWith supple joints, as lively vigour led; \r\rBut who I was, or where, or from what cause, 270 \r\rKnew not. To speak I tried, and forthwith spake; \r\rMy tongue obeyed, and readily could name \r\rWhate\'er I saw. \'Thou Sun,\' said I, \'fair light, \r\rAnd thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay, \r\rYe hills and dales, ye rivers, woods, and plains, \r\rAnd ye that live and move, fair creatures, tell, \r\rTell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here 1 \r\rNot of myself; by some great Maker then, \r\rIn goodness and in power pre-eminent. \r\rTell me, how may I know him, how adore,, u^ 280 \r\rFrom whom I have that thus I move and live, \r\rAnd feel that I am happier than I know ! \' \r\rWhile thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither, \r\rFrom where I first drew air, and first beheld \r\rThis happy light, when answer none returned, \r\rOn a green shady bank, profuse of flowers, \r\r\r\r224 \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. \r\r\r\rPensive I sat me down; there gentle Asleep \r\rFirst found me, and with soft oppression seized \r\rMy drowsed sense, untroubled, though I thought \r\rI then was passing to my former state 290 \r\rInsensible, and forthwith to dissolve : \r\rWhen suddenly stood at my head a dream, \r\rWhose inward apparition gently moved \r\rMy fancy to believe I yet had being, \r\rAnd lived. One came, methought, of shape divine, \r\rAnd said, \'Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise, \r\rFirst Man, of men innumerable ordained \r\rFirst father! called by thee, I come thy guide \r\rTo the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.\' \r\rSo saying, by the hand he took me, raised, 300 \r\rAnd over fields and waters, as in air \r\rSmooth sliding without step, last led me up \r\rA woody mountain, whose high top was plain, \r\rA circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees \r\rPlanted, with walks and bowers, that what I saw \r\rOf Earth before scarce pleasant seemed. Each tree \r\rLoaden with fairest fruit, that hung to the eye \r\rTempting, stirred in me sudden appetite \r\rTo pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found \r\rBefore mine eyes all real, as the dream 310 \r\rHad lively shadowed. Here had new begun \r\rMy wandering, had not He, who was my guide \r\rUp hither, from among the trees appeared, \r\rPresence Divine. Rejoicing, but with awe, \r\rSn adoration at his feet I fell \riubmiss. He reared me, and, \'Whom thou sought\'st I am,\' \rSaid mildly, \' Author of all this thou seest \rAbove, or round about thee, or beneath. \rThis Paradise I give thee; count it thine \r\r\r\rBOOK VIII. \r\r\r\r225 \r\r\r\rTo till and keep, and of the fruit to eat : 320 \r\rOf every tree that in the garden grows \r\rP^at freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth. \r\rBut of the Tree whose operation brings \r\rKnowledge of good and ill, which I have set, \r\rThe pledge of thy obedience and thy faith, \r\rAmid the garden by the Tree of Life, \r\rRemember what I warn thee, shun to taste, \r\rAnd shun the bitter consequence : for know, \r\rThe day thou eat\'st thereof, my sole command \r\rTransgressed, inevitably thou shalt die, 330 \r\rFrom that day mortal, and this happy state \r\rShalt lose, expelled from hence into a world \r\rOf woe and sorrow.\' Sternly he pronounced \r\rThe rigid interdiction, which resounds \r\rYet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice \r\rNot to incur; but soon his clear aspect \r\rReturned, and gracious purpose thus renewed : \r\r\'Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth \r\rTo thee and to thy race- I give; as lords \r\rPossess it, and all things that therein live, 340 \r\rOr live in sea or air beast, fish, and fowl. \r\rIn sign whereof, each bird and beast behold \r\rAfter their kinds; I bring them to receive \r\rFrom thee their names, and pay thee fealty \r\rWith low subjection; understand the same \r\rOf fish within their watery residence, \r\rNot hither summoned, since they cannot change \r\rTheir element to draw the thinner air.\' \r\rAs thus he spake, each bird and beast behold \r\rApproaching two and two; these cowering low 350 \r\rWith blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing. \r\rI named them as they passed, and understood \r\rP. L. 15 \r\r\r\r226 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTheir nature; with such knowledge God endued \r|" My sudden apprehension. But in these \rjn I found not what, methought, I wanted still, \r\rL-And to the Heavenly Vision thus presumed : \r\r" \'O, by what name for thou above all these, \rAbove mankind, or aught than mankind higher, \rSurpassest far my naming how may I \rAdore thee, Author of this Universe, 360 \r\rAnd all this good to Man, for whose well-being \rSo amply, and with hands so liberal, \r\r/Thou hast provided all things? But with me \r^rl see not who partakes. In solitude \r\r1 What happiness ? who can enjoy alone, \r\r\\^Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?\' \rThus I presumptuous ; and the Vision bright, \rAs with a smile more brightened, thus replied : \r\r"\'What calPst thou solitude? Is not the Earth \rWith various living creatures, and the air, 370 \r\rReplenished, and all these at thy command \rTo come and play before thee? Know\'st thou not \rTheir language and their ways? They also know, \rAnd reason not contemptibly; with these \rFind pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.\' \rSo spake the universal Lord, and seemed \rSo ordering. I, with leave of speech implored, \rAnd humble deprecation, thus replied : \r\r" \' Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power ! \rMy Maker, be propitious while I speak. 380 \r\r\'Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, \r\rv And these inferior far beneath me set? \rAmong unequals what society \rCan sort, what harmony or true delight? \rWhich must be mutual, in proportion due \r\r\r\rBOOK VIII. 227 \r\rGiven and received; but in disparity, \rThe one intense, the other still remiss, \rCannot well suit with either, but soon prove \rTedious alike. Of fellowship I speak, \r:Such as I seek, fit to participate 390 \r\rAll rational delight, wherein the brute \rCannot be human consort : they rejoice \r?Each with their kind, lion with lioness ; \r\'So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined; \rMuch less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl, \rSo well converse, nor with the ox the ape ; \rWorse then can man with beast, and least of all.\' \r\r"Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased: \r*A nice and subtle happiness, I see, \rThou to thyself proposest, in the choice 400 \r\rOf thy associates, Adam, and wilt taste \rNo pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary. \rWhat think\'st thou then of me, and this my state? \rSeem I to thee sufficiently possessed \rOf happiness, or not? who am alone \rFrom all eternity; for none I know \rSecond to me or like, equal much less. \rHow have I then with whom to hold converse, \rSave with the creatures which I made, and those \rTo me inferior, infinite descents 410 \r\rBeneath what other creatures are to thee?\' \r\r" He ceased ; I lowly answered : * To attain \rThe highth and depth of thy eternal ways \rAll human thoughts come short, Supreme of things ! \rThou in thyself art perfect, and in thee \rIs no deficience found; not so is Man, \rBut in degree the cause of his desire \rBy conversation with his like to help \r\r\'52 \r\r\r\r228 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOr solace his defects. No need that thou \r\rShould\'st propagate, already infinite, 420 \r\rAnd through all numbers absolute, though One; \r\rBut Man by number is to manifest \r\ri His single imperfection, and beget \r\r| Like of his like, his image multiplied, \rIn unity defective ; which requires \rCollateral love, and dearest amity. \rThou, in thy secrecy although alone, \rBest with thyself accompanied, seek\'st not \rSocial communication; yet, so pleased, \rCanst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt 430 \rOf union or communion, deified; \rI, by conversing, cannot these erect \rFrom prone, nor in their ways complacence find/ \rThus I emboldened spake, and freedom used \rPermissive, and acceptance found; which gained \rThis answer from the gracious Voice Divine : \r\r" \' Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased, \rAnd find thee knowing not of beasts alone, \rWhich thou hast rightly named, but of thyself, \rExpressing well the spirit within thee free, 440 \r\rMy image, not imparted to the brute ; \rWhose fellowship therefore, unmeet for thee, \rGood reason was thou freely shouldst dislike; \rAnd be so minded still.

Sweetness into my heart unfelt before, \rAnd into all things from her air inspired \rThe spirit of love and amorous delight. \rShe disappeared, and left me dark; I waked \rTo find her, or for ever to deplore \r\rHer loss, and other pleasures all abjure : 480 \r\rWhen, out of hope, behold her not far off, \rSuch as I saw her in my dream, adorned \rWith what all Earth or Heaven could bestow \rTo make her amiable. On she came, \r\r\r\r230 PARADISE LOST. \r\rLed by her Heavenly Maker, though unseen, \r\r^And guided by his voice, nor uninformed \r, Of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites. \r\rGrace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye, \r\rIn every gesture dignity and love. \r\rI, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud : 490 \r\r" \' This turn hath made amends ; thou hast fulfilled \rThy words, Creator bounteous and benign, \rGiver of all things fair, but fairest this \rOf all thy gifts ! nor enviest. I now see \rBone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, my self \rBefore me ; Woman is her name, of Man \rExtracted ; for this cause he shall forgo \rFather and mother, and to his wife adhere, \rAnd they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.\' \r/ "She heard me thus; and, though divinely brought, ^500 \rYet innocence and virgin modesty, \rHer virtue and the conscience of her worth, \rThat would be wooed, and not unsought be won, \rNot obvious, not obtrusive, but retired, \rThe more desirable or, to say all, \rNature herself, though pure of sinful thought \rWrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned; \rI followed her; she what was honour knew, \rAnd with obsequious majesty approved \r\rMy pleaded reason.

Yet when I approach \rHer loveliness, so absolute she seems \rAnd in herself complete, so well to know \r\r\r\r\r\r\rHer own, that what she wills to do or say \r\rSeems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best : 550 \r\rAll higher Knowledge in her presence falls \r\r\r\r232 PARADISE LOST. \r\rDegraded; Wisdom in discourse with her \rLoses discountenanced, and like Folly shows; \rAuthority and Reason on her wait, \rAs one intended first, not after made \rOccasionally; and to consummate all, \rGreatness of mind and nobleness their seat \rBuild in her loveliest, and create an awe \r.About her, as a guard angelic placed." \r\rTo whom the Angel, with contracted brow : 560 \r\r"Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part; \rDo thou but thine, and be not diffident \rOf Wisdom ; she deserts thee not, if thou \rDismiss not her, when most thou need\'st her nigh, \rBy attributing overmuch to things \rLess excellent, as thou thyself perceiv\'st. \rFor what admir\'st thou, what transports thee so? \rAn outside : fair, no doubt, and worthy well \rThy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love; \rNot thy subjection.

Stand fast; to stand or fall, 640 \r\rFree in thine own arbitrement it lies. \r\rPerfect within, no outward aid require; \r\rAnd all temptation to transgress repel." \rSo saying, he arose ; whom Adam thus \r\rFollowed with benediction : " Since to part, \r\rGo, Heavenly guest, Ethereal messenger, \r\rSent from whose sovran goodness I adore! \r\rGentle to me and affable hath been \r\rThy condescension, and shall be honoured ever \r\rWith grateful memory; thou to Mankind 650 \r\rBe good and friendly still, and oft return ! " \rSo parted they, the Angel up to Heaven \r\rFrom the thick shade, and Adam to his bower. \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\rSatan, having compassed the Earth, with meditated guile returns as \ra mist by night into Paradise ; enters into the Serpent sleeping. Adam \rand Eve in the morning go forth to their labours, which Eve proposes \rto divide in several places, each labouring apart: Adam consents not, \ralleging the danger, lest that enemy, of whom they were forewarned, \rshould attempt her found alone. Eve, loth to be thought not circum- \rspect or firm enough, urges her going apart, the rather desirous to make \rtrial of her strength; Adam at last yields. The Serpent finds her alone : \rhis subtle approach, first gazing, then speaking, with much flattery \rextolling Eve above all other creatures. Eve, wondering to hear the \rSerpent speak, asks how he attained to human speech and such under- \rstanding, not till now ; the Serpent answers, that by tasting of a certain \rtree in the garden he attained both to speech and reason, till then void \rof both. Eve requires him to bring her to that tree, and finds it to be \rthe Tree of Knowledge forbidden. The Serpent, now grown bolder, \rwith many wiles and arguments induces her at length to eat ; she, \rpleased with the taste, deliberates a while whether to impart thereof to \rAdam or not; at last brings him of the fruit; relates what persuaded \rher to eat thereof. Adam, at first amazed, but perceiving her lost, \rresolves through vehemence of love to perish with her; and, extenuating \rthe trespass, eats also of the fruit. The effects thereof in them both ; \rthey seek to cover their nakedness ; then fall to variance and accusation \rof one another. \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. \r\r\r\rNO more of talk where God or Angel-guest \rWith Man, as with his friend, familiar used \rTo sit indulgent, and with him partake \rRural repast, permitting him the while \rVenial discourse unblamed. I now must change \rThose notes to tragic; foul distrust and breach \rDisloyal on the part of man, revolt \rAnd disobedience; on the part of Heaven, \rNow alienated, distance and distaste, \rAnger and just rebuke, and judgment given, 10 \r\rThat brought into this World a world of woe, \rSin and her shadow Death, and Misery, \rDeath\'s harbinger. Sad task ! yet argument \rNot less but more heroic than the wrath \rOf stern Achilles on his foe pursued \rThrice fugitive about Troy wall; or rage \rOf Turnus for Lavinia disespoused ; \rOr Neptune\'s ire, or Juno\'s, that so long \rPerplexed the Greek, and Cytherea\'s son: \rIf answerable style I can obtain 20 \r\rOf my celestial patroness, who deigns \rHer nightly visitation unimplored, \r\r\r\r238 PARADISE LOST. \r\rAnd dictates to me slumbering, or inspires \r\rEasy my unpremeditated verse, \r\rSince first this subject for heroic song \r\rPleased me, long choosing and beginning late, \r\rNot sedulous by nature to indite \r\rWars, hitherto the only argument \r\rHeroic deemed, chief mastery to dissect \r\rWith long and tedious havoc fabled knights 30 \r\rIn battles feigned (the better fortitude \r\rOf patience and heroic martyrdom \r\rUnsung), or to describe races and games, \r\rOr tilting furniture, imblazoned shields, \r\rImpresses quaint, caparisons and steeds, \r\rBases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights \r\rAt joust and tournament; then marshalled feast \r\rServed up in hall with sewers and seneshals: \r\rThe skill of artifice or office mean ; \r\rNot that which justly gives heroic name 40 \r\rTo person or to poem. Me, of these \r\rNor skilled nor studious, higher argument \r\rRemains, sufficient of itself to raise \r\rThat name, unless an age too late, or cold \r\rClimate, or years, damp my intended wing \r\rDepressed ; and much they may, if all be mine, \r\rNot hers who brings it nightly to my ear. \r\rThe sun was sunk, and after him the star \rOf Hesperus, whose office is to bring \rTwilight upon the Earth, short arbiter 50 \r\r\'Twixt day and night, and now from end to end \rNight\'s hemisphere had veiled the horizon round; \rWhen Satan, who late fled before the threats \rOf Gabriel out of Eden, now improved \rIn meditated fraud and malice, bent \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. \r\r\r\r239 \r\r\r\rOn Man\'s destruction, maugre what might hap \r\rOf heavier on himself, fearless returned. \r\rBy night he fled, and at midnight returned \r\rFrom compassing the Earth; cautious of day, \r\rSince Uriel, regent of the sun, descried 60 \r\rHis entrance, and forewarned the Cherubim \r\rThat kept their watch. Thence, full of anguish, driven, \r\rThe space of seven continued nights he rode \r\rWith darkness ; thrice the equinoctial line \r\rHe circled, four times crossed the car of Night \r\rFrom pole to pole, traversing each colure; \r\r\\On the eighth returned, and on the coast averse \rFrom entrance or cherubic watch by stealth \rFound unsuspected way. There was a place \r(Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change) 70 \rWhere Tigris, at the foot of Paradise, \rInto a gulf shot under ground, till part \rRose up a fountain by the Tree of Life. \rIn with the river sunk, and with it rose, \rSatan, involved in rising mist; then sought \rWhere to lie hid. Sea he had searched and land \rFrom Eden over Pontus, and the pool \rMaeotis, up beyond the river Ob ; \rDownward as far antarctic; and in length \rWest from Orontes to the ocean barred 80 \r\rAt Darien, thence to the land where flows \rGanges and Indus. Thus the orb he roamed \rWith narrow search, and with inspection deep \rConsidered every creature, which of all \rMost opportune might serve his wiles, and found \rThe serpent subtlest beast of all the field. \rHim, after long debate, irresolute \rOf thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose \r\r\r\r\r\r\r240 PARADISE LOST. \r\rFit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom \r\rTo enter, and his dark suggestions hide 90 \r\rFrom sharpest sight; for in the wily snake \r\rWhatever sleights none would suspicious mark, \r\rAs from his wit and native subtlety \r\rProceeding, which, in other beasts observed, \r\rDoubt might beget of diabolic power \r\rActive within beyond the sense of brute. \r\rThus he resolved, but first from inward grief \r\rHis bursting passion into plaints thus poured : \r\r" O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred \rMore justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built 100 \r\rWith second thoughts, reforming what was old ! \rFor what God, after better, worse would build? \rTerrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens \rThat shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps, \rLight above light, for thee alone, as seems, \rIn thee concentring all their precious beams \rOf sacred influence ! As God in Heaven \rIs centre, yet extends to all, so thou \rCentring receiv\'st from all those orbs ; in thee, \rNot in themselves, all their known virtue appears no \rProductive in herb, plant, and nobler birth \rOf creatures animate with gradual life \rOf growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man. \rWith what delight could I have walked thee round, \rIf I could joy in aught, sweet interchange \rOf hill and valley, rivers, woods, and plains, \rNow land, now sea, and shores with forest crowned, \rRocks, dens, and caves ! but I in none of these \rFind place or refuge; and the more I see \rPleasures about me, so much more I feel 120 \r\rTorment within me, as from the hateful siege \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. \r\r\r\r241 \r\r\r\rOf contraries ; all good to me becomes \rBane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state. \rBut neither here seek I, no, nor in Heaven \rTo dwell, unless by mastering Heaven\'s Supreme ; \rNor hope to be myself less miserable \rBy what I seek, but others to make such \rAs I, though thereby worse to me redound : \rFor only in destroying I find ease \r\rTo my relentless thoughts; and, him destroyed, 130 \r\rOr won to what may work his utter loss, \rFor whom all this was made, all this will soon \rFollow, as to him linked in weal or woe ; \rIn woe then, that destruction wide may range ! \rTo me shall be the glory sole among \rThe infernal Powers, in one day to have marred \rWhat he, Almighty styled, six nights and days \rContinued making, and who knows how long \ri Before had been contriving? though perhaps \rNot longer than since I in one night freed 140 \r\rFrom servitude inglorious well nigh half \rThe Angelic name, and thinner left the throng \rOf his adorers. He, to be avenged, \rAnd to repair his numbers thus impaired \rWhether such virtue spent of old now failed \rMore Angels to create, if they at least \rAre his created, or to spite us more \rDetermined to advance into our room \rA creature formed of earth, and him endow, \rExalted from so base original, 150 \r\rWith Heavenly spoils, our spoils. What he decreed \rHe effected; Man he made, and for him built \rMagnificent this World, and Earth his seat, \rHim lord pronounced, and, O indignity ! \r\rp. L. l6 \r\r\r\r242 PARADISE LOST. \r\rSubjected to his service Angel-wings, \r\rAnd flaming ministers to watch and tend \r\rTheir earthy charge. Of these the vigilance \r\rI dread, and, to elude, thus wrapt in mist \r\rOf midnight vapour glide obscure, and pry \r\rIn every bush and brake, where hap may find 160 \r\rThe serpent sleeping, in whose mazy folds \r\rTo^hide me, and the dark intent I bring. \r\rO foul descent ! that I, who erst contended \r\rWith Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained \r\rInto a beast, and, mixed with bestial slime, \r\rThis essence to incarnate and imbrute, \r\rThat to the highth of deity aspired ! \r\rBut what will not ambition and revenge \r\rDescend to? Who aspires must down as low \r\rAs high he soared, obnoxious first or last 170 \r\rTo basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet, \r\rBitter ere long back on itself recoils. \r\rLet it; I reck not, so it light well aimed \r\r(Since higher I fall short) on him who next \r\rProvokes my envy, this new favourite \r\rOf Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite, \r\rWhom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised \r\rFrom dust : spite then with spite is best repaid." \r\rSo saying, through each thicket, dank or dry, \rLike a black mist low-creeping, he held on 180 \r\rHis midnight search, where soonest he might find \rThe serpent. Him fast sleeping soon he found, \rIn labyrinth of many a round self-rolled, \rHis head the midst, well stored with subtle wiles: \rNot yet in horrid shade or dismal den, \rNor nocent yet, but on the grassy herb, \rFearless, unfeared, he slept. In at his mouth \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. \r\r\r\r243 \r\r\r\rThe Devil entered, and his brutal sense, \r\rIn heart or head, possessing soon inspired \r\rWith act intelligential ; but his sleep 190 \r\rDisturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn. \r\rNow, whenas sacred light began to dawn \rIn Eden on the humid flowers, that breathed \rTheir morning incense, when all things that breathe \rFrom the Earth\'s great altar send up silent praise \rTo the Creator, and his nostrils fill \rWith grateful smell, forth came the human pair, \rAnd joined their vocal worship to the quire \rOf creatures wanting voice ; that done, partake \rThe season, prime for sweetest scents and airs; 200 \r\rThen commune how that day they best may ply \r\\ Their growing work; for much their work outgrew \r\\ The hands\' dispatch of two, gardening so wide : \r* And Eve first to her husband thus began : \r\r"Adam, well may we labour still to dress \rThis garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower, \rOur pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands \rAid us, the work under our labour grows, \rLuxurious by restraint : what we by day \rLop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, 210 \r\rOne night or two with wanton growth derides, \rTending to wild. Thou therefore now advise, \rOr hear what to my mind first thoughts present: \r\\Let us divide our labours thou where choice \rLeads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind \rThe woodbine round this arbour, or direct \rThe clasping ivy where to climb; while I, \rIn yonder spring of roses intermixed \rWith myrtle, find what to redress till noon. \rFor, while so near each other thus all day 220 \r\r\r\r16 2 \r\r\r\r244 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOur task we choose, what wonder if so near \rLooks intervene and smiles, or object new \rCasual discourse draw on, which intermits \rOur day\'s work, brought to little, though begun \rEarly, and the hour of supper comes unearned ! " \r\rTo whom mild answer Adam thus returned : \r"Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond \rCompare above all living creatures dear ! \rWell hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed \rHow we might best fulfil the work which here 230 \r\rGod hath assigned us, nor of me shalt pass \ri Unpraised; for nothing lovelier can be found \rIn woman than to study household good, \rAnd good works in her husband to promote. \rYet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed \rLabour, as to debar us when we need \rRefreshment, whether food, or talk between, \rFood of the mind, or this sweet intercourse \rOf looks and smiles ; for smiles from reason flow, \rTo brute denied, and are of love the food 240 \r\rLove, not the lowest end of human life. \rFor not to irksome toil, but to delight, \rHe made us, and delight to reason joined. \rThese paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands \rWill keep from wilderness with ease, as wide \rAs we need walk, till younger hands ere long \rAssist us. But if much converse perhaps \rThee satiate, to short absence I could yield; \rFor solitude sometimes is best society, \r.And short retirement urges sweet return. 250 \r\rBut other doubt possesses me, lest harm \rBefall thee severed from me; for thou know\'st \rWhat hath been warned us, what malicious foe, \r\r\r\rV \r\r\r\r\r\r\rBOOK IX. 245 \r\rEnvying our happiness, and of his own \rDespairing, seeks to work us woe and shame \rBy sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand \rWatches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find \rHis wish and best advantage, us asunder, \rHopeless to circumvent us joined, where each \rTo other speedy aid might lend at need. 260 \r\rWhether his first design be to withdraw \rOur fealty from God, or to disturb \rConjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss \rEnjoyed by us excites his envy more; \rOr this, or worse, leave not the faithful side \rThat gave thee being, still shades thee and protects, \rf The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, \r* I Safest and seemliest by her husband stays, \r7 [Who guards her, or with her the worst endures." \r\rTo whom the virgin majesty of Eve, 270 \r\rAs one who loves, and some unkindness meets, \r/With sweet austere composure thus replied : \r\r"Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth\'s lord! \rThat such an enemy we have, who seeks \rOur ruin, both by thee informed I learn, \rAnd from the parting Angel overheard, \rAs in a shady nook I stood behind, \rJust then returned at shut of evening flowers. \rBut that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt \rTo God or thee, because we have a foe 280 \r\rMay tempt it, I expected not to hear. \rHis violence thou fear\'st not, being such \rAs we, not capable of death or pain, \r\rI Can either not receive, or can repel. \rHis fraud is then thy fear; which plain infers \rThy equal fear that my firm faith and love \r\r\r\r246 PARADISE LOST. \r\rj Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced ; \r\rI Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast, \r\rl Adam 1 misthought of her to thee so dear?" \r\rTo whom with healing words Adam replied: 290 \r\r" Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve ! \rFor such thou art, from sin and blame entire; \r\riNot diffident of thee do I dissuade \r\rJThy absence from my sight, but to avoid \r|The attempt itself, intended by our foe. \r\r"" For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses \rThe tempted with dishonour foul, supposed \rNot incorruptible of faith, not proof \rAgainst temptation. Thou thyself with scorn \rAnd anger wouldst resent the offered wrong, 300 \r\rThough ineffectual found; misdeem not then, \rIf such affront I labour to avert \rFrom thee alone, which on us both at once \rThe enemy, though bold, will hardly dare, \rOr daring, first on me the assault shall light. \rNor thou his malice and false guile contemn \rSubtle he needs must be, who could seduce \rAngels nor think superfluous others\' aid. \rI from the influence of thy looks receive \rAccess in every virtue; in thy sight 310 \r\rMore wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were \rOf outward strength ; while shame, thou looking on, \rShame to be overcome or overreached, \rWould utmost vigour raise, and raised unite. \rWhy shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel \rWhen I am present, and thy trial choose \rWith me, best witness of thy virtue tried?" \rf So spake domestic Adam in his care \rAnd matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. 247 \r\r(Less attributed to her faith sincere, 320 \r\r(Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed : \r" If this be our condition thus to dwell \r\rIn narrow circuit straitened by a foe, \r\rSubtle or violent, we not endued \r\rSingle with like defence wherever met, \rv. How are we happy, still in fear of harm ? \r\rIfut harm precedes not sin : only our foe \r\rTempting affronts us with his foul esteem \r\rOf our integrity ; his foul esteem \r\rSticks no dishonour on our front, but turns 330 \r\rFoul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared \r\rBy us? who rather double honour gain \r\rFrom his surmise proved false, find peace within, \r\rFavour from Heaven, our witness, from the event, \rt r "And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed \ruAlone, without exterior help sustained? \r\rLet us not then suspect our happy state \r\rLeft so imperfect by the^ Maker wise, \r\rAs not secure to single or combined. \r\rFrail is our happiness, if this be so, 340 \r\rAnd Eden were no Eden, thus exposed." \rTo whom thus Adam fervently replied : \r\r"O Woman, best are all things as the will \r\rOf God ordained them ; his creating hand \r\rNothing imperfect or deficient left \r\rOf all that he created, much less Man, \r\rOr aught that might his happy state secure, \r\rSecure from outward force: within himself \r\rThe danger lies, yet lies within his power; \r\rAgainst his will he can receive no harm. 350 \r\rfree the will ; for what obeys \r\rReason is ftce," \'and Reason \r\r\r\r248 PARADISE LOST. \r\rBut bid her well be ware, and still erect, \rLest, by some fair appearing good surprised, \rShe dictate false, and misinform the will \rTo do what God expressly hath forbid. \rNot then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins \rThat I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. \rFirm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, \rSince Reason not impossibly may meet 360 \r\rSome specious object by the foe suborned, \rAnd fall into deception unaware, \rf Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned. \r\\ Seek not temptation then, which to avoid \ri Were better, and most likely if from me \r\\Thou sever not : trial will come unsought. \rWouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve \rFirst thy obedience ; the other who can know, \rNot seeing thee attempted, who attest? \rBut if thou think trial unsought may find 370 \r\rUs both securer than thus warned thou seem\'st, \rGo; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; \rGo in thy native innocence, rely \rOn what thou hast of virtue, summon all; \rFor God towards thee hath done his part; do thine." \r\rSo spake the patriarch of mankind; but Eve \rPersisted; yet submiss, though last, replied: \r\r"With thy permission then, and thus forewarned, \rChiefly by what thine own last reasoning words \rTouched only, that our trial, when least sought, 380 \r\rMay find us both perhaps far less prepared, \rThe willinger I go, nor much expect \rA foe so proud will first the weaker seek ; \rSo bent, the more shall shame him his repulse." \r\rThus saying, from her husband\'s hand her hand \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. 249 \r\rSoft she withdrew, and like a wood-nymph light, \r\rDread or pryafl T nr .o. .Delia\'s trajn, \r\rBetook her to the groves, but Delia\'s self \r\rIn gait surpassed and goddess-like deport, \r\rThough not as she with bow and quiver armed, 390 \r\rBut with such gardening tools as art, yet rude, \r\rGuiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought. \r\rTo Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned, \r\rLikest she seemed Pomona when she fled \r\rVertumnus or to Ceres in her prime, \r\rYet virgin of Proserpina from Jove. \r\r[Her long with ardent look his eye pursued \r\rDelighted, but desiring more her stay. \r/ Oft he to her his charge of quick return \r\rRepeated; she to him as oft engaged 400 \r\rTo be returned by noon amid the bower, \r\rAnd all things in best order to invite \r\rNoontide repast, or afternoon\'s repose. \r\rO much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve, \r\rOf thy presumed return.! event perverse ! \r\rThou never from that hour in Paradise \r\rFound\'st either sweet repast or sound repose; \r\rSuch ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades, \r\rWaited with hellish rancour imminent \r\rTo intercept thy way, or send thee back 410 \r\rDespoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss. \r\rFor now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend, \r\rMere serpent in appearance, forth was come, \r^jVnd on his quest, where likeliest he might find \r\\ The only two of mankind, but in them \rVjhe whole included race, his purposed prey. \r\rIn bower and field he sought, where any tuft \r\rOf grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay, \r\r\r\r2 SO PARADISE LOST. \r\rTheir tendance or plantation for delight; \r\rBy fountain or by shady rivulet 420 \r\rHe sought them both, but wished his hap might find \r\rEve separate; he wished, but not with hope \r\rOf what so seldom chanced; when to his wish, \r\rBeyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, \r\rVeiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood, \r\rHalf-spied, so thick the roses bushing round \r\rAbout her glowed, oft stooping to support \r\rEach flower of tender stalk, whose head, though gay \r\rCarnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold, \r\rHung drooping unsustained : them she upstays 430 \r\rGently with myrtle band, mindless the while \r\rHerself, though fairest unsupported flower, \r\rFrom her best prop so far, and storm so nigh. \r\rNearer he drew, and many a walk traversed \r\rOf stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm ; \r\rThen voluble and bold, now hid, now seen, \r\rAmong thick-woven arborets, and flowers \r\rImbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve: \r\rSpot more delicious than those gardens feigned \r\rOr of revived Adonis, or renowned 440 \r\rAkinotu^ host of QMJLaeitSS\' son, \r\rOr that, not mystic, where the sapient king \r\rHeld dalliance with Jiis fair Egyptian spouse. \r\rMuch he the place admired, the person more. \r\rAs one who, long in populous city pent, \r\rWhere houses thick and sewers annoy the air, \r\rForth issuing on a summer\'s morn to breathe \r\rAmong the pleasant villages and farms \r\rAdjoined, from each thing met conceives delight \r\rThe smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine, 450 \r\rOr dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound ; \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. 251 \r\rIf chance with nymph-like step fair virgin pass, \r\rWhat pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more, \r\rShe most, and in her look sums all delight : \r\rSuch pleasure took the Serpent to behold \r\rThis flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve \r\rThus early, thus alone. Her heavenly form \r\rAngelic, but more soft and feminine, \r\rHer graceful innocence, her every air \r\rOf gesture or least action, overawed 460 \r\rHis malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved \r\rHis fierceness of the fierce intent it brought : \r\rThat space the Evil One abstracted stood \r\rFrom his own evil, and for the time remained \r\rStupidly good, of enmity disarmed, \r\rOf guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge. \r\rBut the hot hell that always in him burns, \r\rThough in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight, \r\rAnd tortures him now more, the more he sees \r\rOf pleasure not for him ordained ; then soon 470 \r\rFierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts \r\rOf mischief, gratulating, thus excites : \r\r" Thoughts, whither have ye led me ? with what sweet \rCompulsion thus transported to forget \rWhat hither brought us? hate, not love, nor hope \rOf Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste \rOf pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, \rSave what is in destroying; other joy \rTo me is lost. Then let me not let pass \rOccasion which now smiles : behold alone 480 \r\rThe woman, opportune to all attempts, \riHer husband, for I view far round, not nigh, \rf IWhose higher intellectual more I shun, \r| (And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb \r\r\r\r252 PARADISE LOST. \r\r/^Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould; \rFoe not informidable, exempt from wound, \rI not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain \rEnfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven. \rShe fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods, \rNot terrible, though terror be in love 490 \r\rAnd beauty, not approached by stronger hate, \rHate stronger under show of love well feigned \rThe way which to her ruin now I tend." \r\rSo spake the Enemy of mankind, enclosed \rIn serpent, inmate bad, and toward Eve \rAddressed his way not with indented wave, \rProne on the ground, as since, but on his rear, \rCircular base of rising folds, that towered \rFold above fold, a surging maze; his head \rCrested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes; 500 \r\rWith burnished neck of verdant gold, erect \rAmidst his circling spires, that on the grass \rFloated redundant. Pleasing was his shape \rAnd lovely; never since of serpent kind \rLovelier; not those that in Illyria changed \rHermione and Cadmus, or the god \rIn Epidaurus; nor to which transformed \rAmmonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen, \rHe with Olympias, this with her who bore \rScipio, the highth of Rome. With tract oblique 510 \r\rAt first, as one who sought access but feared \rTo interrupt, sidelong he works his way. \rAs when a ship by skilful steersman wrought \rNigh river\'s mouth or foreland, where the wind \rVeers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail: \rSo varied he, and of his tortuous train \rCurled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, \r\r\r\r1 \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. 253 \r\rTo lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound \r\rOf rustling leaves, but minded not, as used \r\rTo such disport before her through the field, 520 \r\rFrom every beast, more duteous at her call, \r\rThan at Circean call the herd disguised. \r\rHe, bolder ncnv, uncalled before her stood, \r\rBut as in gaze admiring. Oft he bowed \r\rHis turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck, \r\rFawning, and licked the ground whereon she trod. \r\rHis gentle dumb expression turned at length \r\rThe eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad \r\rOf her attention gained, with serpent-tongue \r\rOrganic, or impulse of vocal air, 530 \r\rHis fraudulent temptation thus began : \r\rIf" Wonder not, sovran mistress, if perhaps \r\rThou canst who art sole wonder; much less arm \r\rThy looks, the heaven of mildness, with disdain, \r\rDispleased that I approach thee thus, and gaze \r\rInsatiate, I thus single, nor have feared \r\rThy awful brow, more awful thus retired. \r\rFairest resemblance of thy Maker fair, \r\rThee all things living gaze on, all things thine \r\rBy gift, and thy celestial beauty adore, 540 \r\rWith ravishment beheld there best beheld \r\rWhere universally admired; but here \r\rIn this enclosure wild, these beasts among, \r\rBeholders rude, and shallow to discern \r\rHalf what in thee is fair, one man except, \r\rWho sees thee ? (and what is one ?) who shouldst be seen \r\rA Goddess among Gods, adored and served \r\rBy Angels numberless, thy daily train." \r\rSo glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned; \rInto the heart of Eve his words made way, 550 \r\r\r\r254 PARADISE LOST. \r\rThough at the voice much marvelling; at length, \rNot unamazed, she thus in answer spake : \r\r"What may this mean? Language of Man pronounced \rBy tongue of brute, and human sense expressed ! \rThe first at least of these I thought denied \rTo beasts, whom God on their creation- day \rCreated mute to all articulate sound; \rThe latter I demur, for in their looks \rMuch reason, and in their actions, oft appears, \rThee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field 560 \r\rI knew, but not with human voice endued ; \rRedouble then this miracle, and say, \rHow cam\'st thou speakable of mute, and how \rTo me so friendly grown above the rest \rOf brutal kind, that daily are in sight : \rSay, for such wonder claims attention due." \r\rTo whom the guileful Tempter thus replied: \r"Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve! \rEasy to me it is to tell thee all \rWhat thou command\'st, and right thou shouldst be \r\robey\'d. 570 \r\rI was at first as other beasts that graze \rThe trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low, \rAs was my food, nor aught but food discerned \rOr sex, and apprehended nothing high : \rTill on a day, roving the field, I chanced \rA goodly tree far distant to behold, \rLoaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed, \rRuddy and gold. I nearer drew to gaze; \rWhen from the boughs a savoury odour blown, \rGrateful to appetite, more pleased my sense 580 \r\rThan smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats \rOf ewe or goat dropping with milk at even, \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. 255 \r\rUnsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play. \r\rTo satisfy the sharp desire I had \r\rOf tasting those fair apples, I resolved \r\rNot to defer; hunger and thirst at once, \r\rPowerful persuaders, quickened at the scent \r\rOf that alluring fruit, urged me so keen. \r\rAbout the mossy trunk I wound me soon ; \r\rFor, high from ground,* the branches would require 590 \r\rThy utmost reach or Adam\'s : round the tree \r\rAll other beasts that saw, with like desire \r\rLonging and envying stood, but could not reach. \r\rAmid the tree now got, where plenty hung \r\rTempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill \r\rI spared not; for such pleasure till that hour \r\rAt feed or fountain never had I found. \r\rf Sated at length, ere long I might perceive \r\r\\ Strange alteration in me, to degree \r\rOf reason in my inward powers, and speech 600 \r\rWanted not long, though to this shape retained. \r\rThenceforth to speculations high or deep \r\rI turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind \r\rConsidered all things visible in Heaven, \r\rOr Earth, or middle, all things fair and good: \r\rBut all that fair and good in thy divine \r\rSemblance, and in thy beauty\'s heavenly ray, \r\rUnited I beheld; no fair to thine \r\rEquivalent or second, which compelled \r\rMe thus, though importune perhaps, to come 610 \r\rAnd gaze, and worship thee of right declared \r\rSovran of creatures, universal Dame ! n \r\rSo talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve, \rYet more amazed, unwary thus replied: \r" Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt \r\r\r\r256 PARADISE LOST. \r\rThe virtue of that fruit, in thee first proved. \r\rBut say, where grows the tree? from hence how far? \r\rFor many are the trees of God that grow \r\rIn Paradise, and various, yet unknown \r\rTo us; in such abundance lies our choice, 620 \r\rAs leaves a greater store of fruit untouched, \r\rStill hanging incorruptible, till men \r\rGrow up to their provision, and more hands \r\rHelp to disburden Nature of her birth." \r\rTo whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad: \r"Empress, the way is ready, and not long; \rBeyond a row of myrtles, on a flat, \rFast by a fountain, one small thicket past \rOf blowing myrrh and balm : if thou accept \rMy conduct, I can bring thee thither soon." 630 \r\r"Lead then," said Eve. He leading swiftly rolled \rIn tangles, and made intricate seem straight, \rTo mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy \rBrightens his crest. As when a wandering fire, \rCompact of unctuous vapour, which the night \rCondenses, and the cold environs round, \rKindled through agitation to a flame \r(Which oft, they say, some evil spirit attends), \rHovering and blazing with delusive light, \rMisleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way 640 \rTo bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool, \rThere swallowed up and lost, from succour far: \rSo glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud \r\ri Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the Tree \r\rLpf prohibition, root of all our woe; \rWhich when she saw, thus to her guide she spake: \r\r"Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither, \rFruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess, \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. \r\r\r\r257 \r\r\r\rThe credit of whose virtue rest with thee ; \rWondrous indeed, if cause of such effects ! \rBut of this tree we may not taste nor touch ; \rGod so commanded, and left that command \rSole daughter of his voice : the rest, we live \rLaw to ourselves ; our reasor^is our law." \r\rTo whom the Tempter guilefully replied : \r" Indeed ? Hath God then said that of the fruit \rOf all these garden-trees ye shall not eat, \rYet lords declared of all in Earth or air ? " \r\rTo whom thus Eve, yet sinless : " Of the fruit \rOf each tree in the garden we may eat; \rBut of the fruit of this fair tree amidst \rThe garden, God hath said, *Xg \r\r\r\r650 \r\r\r\r660 \r\r\r\r._ \r\rThereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.\'" \r/ She" scarce had "sauT," thcmgh " brief7 when now more bold \rThe Tempter, but with show of zeal and love \rTo Man, and indignation at his wrong, \rNew part puts on, and, as to passion moved, \rFluctuates disturbed, yet comely, and in act \rRaised, as of some great matter to begin. \rAs when of old some orator renowned 670 \r\rIn Athens or free Rome, where eloquence \rFlourished, since mute, to some great cause addressed, \rStood in himself collected, while each part, \rMotion, each act, won audience ere the tongue, \rSometimes in highth began, as no delay \rOf preface brooking through his zeal of right : \rSo standing, moving, or to highth upgrown, \rThe Tempter, all impassioned, thus began :// \r\r"O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plant, \rMother of science ! now I feel thy power 680 \r\rWithin me clear, not only to discern \r\r\r\rp.

Why but to awe, \r\rWhy but to keep ye low and ignorant, \r\rHis worshippers?

But if death 760 \r\rBind us with after-bands, what profits then \rOur inward freedom? In the day we eat \rOf this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die ! \rHow dies the Serpent? He hath eaten and lives, _^ \rAnd knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns, \rIrrational till then. For us alone \rWas death invented? or to us denied \rThis intellectual food, for beasts reserved? \rFor beasts it seems; yet that one beast which first \rHath tasted envies not, but brings with joy 770 \r\rThe good befallen him, author unsuspect, \rFriendly to Man, far from deceit or guile. \rWhat fear I then? rather, what know to fear \rUnder this ignorance of good and evil, \rOf God or death, of law or penalty? \rHere grows the cure of all, this fruit divine, \rFair to the eye, inviting to the taste, \rOf virtue to make wise : what hinders then \rTo reach, and feed at once both body and mind?" \rSo saytng^TileTTash hand in evil hour 780 \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. 26l \r\rForth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat. \r\rEarth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat, \r\rSighing through all her works, gave signs of woe \r\rThat_all was lost. Hack to the thicket slunk \r\rThe guilty Serpent, and well might, for Eve, \r\rIntent now only on her taste, naught else \r\rRegarded; such delight till then, as seemed, \r\rfif Iruit she never tasted, whether true, \r\rOr fancied so through expectation high \r\rOf knowledge ; nor was Godhead from her thought. 790 \r\rGreedily she ingorged without restraint, \r\rAnd knew not eating death. Satiate at length, \r\rAnd hightened as with wine, jocund and boon, \r\rThus to herself she pleasingly began : \r\r"O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees \rIn Paradise ! of operation blest \rTo sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed, \rAnd_ thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end \rCreaiecl! but henceforth my early care, \rNot without song, each -morning, and due praise, 800 \rShall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease \rOf thy full branches, offered free to all; \rTill, dieted by thee, I grow mature \rIn knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; \rThough others envy what they cannot give \rFor, had the gift been theirs, it had not here \rThus grown ! Experience, next to thee I owe, \rBest guide: not* Following thee, I had remained \rIn ignorance : thou open\'st Wisdom\'s way, \rAnd giv\'st access, though secret she retire. 810 \r\rAnd I perhaps am secret; Heaven is high, \rHigh, aiid remote to see from thence distinct \rEach thing on Earth; and other care perhaps \r\r\r\r262 PARADISE LOST. \r\rMay have diverted from continual watch \r\rOur great Forbidder, safe with all his spies \r\rAbout him. But to Adam in what sort \r\rShall I appear? Shall I to him make known \r\rAs yet my change, and give him to partake \r\rFull happiness with me, or rather not, \r\rBut keep the odds of knowledge in my power 820 \r\rWithout copartner ? so to add what wants \r\rIn female sex, the more to draw his love, \r\rAnd render me more equal, and perhaps, \r\rA thing not undesirable, sometime \r\rguperior ; for, inferior, who is free? \r\r\r\rThis may be well: but what if God have seen, \r\rAnd death ensue? then I shall be no more, \r\rAnd Adam, wedded to another Eve, \r\rShall live with her enjoying, I extinct ! \r\rA death to think !

Adam the while, \r\\Waiting desirous her return, had wove \rpf choicest flowers a garland, to adorn 840 \r\r(Her tresses, and her rural labours crown, \rAs \'reapers oft are wont their harvest queen. \rGreat joy he promised to his thoughts, and new \rSolace in her return, so long delayed; \rYet oft his heart, divine of something ill, \rMisgave him; he the faltering measure felt, \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. \r\r\r\r263 \r\r\r\rAnd forth to meet her went, the way she took \rThat morn when first they parted. By the Tree \rOf Knowledge he must pass ; there he her met, \rScarce from the tree returning; in her hand 850 \r\rA bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled, \rNew gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused. \rTo him she hasted; in her face excuse \rCame prologue, and apology to prompt, \rWhich, with bland words at will, she thus addressed : \rr "Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay? \rThee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived \rThy presence agony of love till now \rNot felt, nor shall be twice; for nev&Ljaiore \r\'.

The Serpent wise, \rOr not restrained as we, or not obeying, \rHath eaten of the fruit, and is become, \rNot dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth 870 \r\rEndued with human voice and human sense, \rReasoning to admiration, and with me \rPersuasively hath so prevailed, that I \rHave also tasted, and have also found \rThe effects to correspond opener mine eyes, \rDim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart, \rAnd growing up to Godhead; which for thee \rChiefly I sought, without thee can despise. \rVFor bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss; \r\r\r\r264 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon. 880 \r\rThou therefore also taste, that equal lot \r\rMay join us, equal joy, as equal love; \r\rLest, thou not tasting, different degree \r\rDisjoin us, and I then too late renounce \r\rDeity for thee, when fate will not permit.\' 1 \r\r~ Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told; \r\rBut in her cheek distemper flushing glowed. \r\rOn the other side, Adam, soon as he heard \r\rThe fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed, \r\rAstonied stood and blank, while horror chill 890 \r\rRan through his veins, and all his joints relaxed; \r\rFrom his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve \r\rDown dropt, and all the faded roses shed. \r\rSpeechless he stood and pale, till thus at length \r\rFirst to himself he inward silence broke : \r\r" O fairest of creation, last and best \rOf all God\'s works, creature in whom excelled \rWhatever can to sight or thought be formed, \rHoly, divine, good, amiable, or sweet ! \rHow art thou lost ! how on a sudden lost, 900 \r\rDefaced, deflowered, and now to death devote ! \rRather, how hast thou yielded to transgress \rThe strict forbiddance, how to violate \rThe sacred fruit forbidden ? Some cursed fraud \rOf enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown, \rAnd me with thee hath ruined; for with thee \rCertain my resolution is to die : \rHow can I live without thee? how forgo \rThy sweet converse and love so dearly joined, \rTo live again in these wild woods forlorn? 910 \r\rShould God create another Eve, and I \rAnother rib afford, yet loss of thee \r\r\r\r\r\r\rBOOK IX. \r\r\r\r26 S \r\r\r\rWould never from my heart ; no, no ! I feel \rThe link of nature draw me : flesh of flesh, \rBone of my bone thou art, and from thy state \rMine never shall be parted, bliss_pr_woe.^_ \rso having said, as one from sad dismay \rRecomforted, and, after thoughts disturbed, \rSubmitting to what seemed remediless, \rThus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned : 920 \r\r" Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve, \rAnd peril great provoked, who thus hast dared, \rHad it Seen only coveting to eye \rThat sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence; \rMuch more to taste it, under ban to touch. \rBut past who can recall, or done undo? \rNot God Omnipotent, nor Fate! ggt so \rPerhaps thou_shalt not die; perhaps the fart \rIs not so heinous now foretasted fruit, \rProfaned first by the Serpent, by him first 930 \r\rMade common and unhallowed ere our taste, \rNor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, \rLives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man, \rHigher degree of life : inducement strong \rTo us, as likely, tasting, to attain \rProportional ascent; which cannot be \rBut to be Gods, or Angels, demi-gods. \rNor can I think that God, Creator wise, \rThough threatening, will in earnest so destroy \rUs his prime creatures, dignified so high, * 940 \r\rSet over all his works, which in our fall, \rFor us created, needs with us must fail, \rDependent made; so God shall uncreate, \rBe frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose; \rNot well conceived of God, who, though his power \r\r\r\r266 PARADISE LOST. \r\rCreation could repeat, yet would be loth \r\rUs to abolish, lest the Adversary \r\rTriumph and say: \'Fickle their state whom God \r\rMost favours; who can please him long?

Innocence, that as a veil \rHad shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone; \rJust confidence, and najtive_jighlojisness^ \rVnd fi^nour, from about them, nakedjleft \r\ro^guilty Shame : he covered, but his robe \r\rncovered more. So rose the Danite gtrong T \rHerculean Samson, from the harlot-lap 1060 \r\rOf Phnfstean Dalijah, and wak\'d \rShorn of his strength ; they destitute and bare \rOf all their virtue. Silent, and in face \rConfounded, long they sat, as strucken mute; \rTill Adam, though not less than Eve abashed, \rAt length gave utterance to these words constrained: \r\r" O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear \rTo that false worm, of whomsoever taught \rTo counterfeit Man\'s voice, true in our fall, \rFalse in our promised rising; since our ey_es 1070 \r\rI Opened we find indeed r jmd find we Icnnw \rIBoth gopll and~evil, good lost and evjljyot: \riBad fruTF\'oi knowledge, it\' this"Be~to know, \rWhich leaves us naked thus, of honour void, \rjOf innocence, of faith, ot purity, \rpur^wonted ornaments now soiled_and stained, \rAnd in our faces evident the^jgns \r\r\r\r270 PARADISE LOST. \r\r^fifoul concupiscence; whence evil store, \r"Even shame, the last of evils ; of the first \rBe sure then.

Oh, might I here \rIn solitude live^a^a^e^n_sorne glade \rObscured, where highest woods, impenetrable \rTo star or sunlight, spread their umbrage broad, \r\rI* And brown as evening ! Cover me, ye pines ! \rYe cedars, with innumerable boughs \rHide me, where I may never see them more ! 1090 \r\rBut let us now, as in bad plight, devise \rWhat best may for the present serve to hide \rThe parts of each frorjx-Qtb^i: that seem most \rTo shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen ; \rSome tree,^wlio^e"l)road smooth leaves together sewed, \rAnd girded on our loins, may cover round \rThose middle parts, that this new comer, Shame, \rThere sit not, and reproach us as unclean." \rSo counselled he, and both together went \rInto the thickest wood; there soon they chose noo \r\rThe fig-tree not that kind for fruit renowned, \rBut such as at this day, to Indians known, \rIn Malabar or Decan spreads her arms \rBranching so broad and long that in the ground \rThe bended twigs take root, and daughters grow \rAbout tne mother tree, a pillared shade \rHigh overarched, and echoing walks between : \rThere oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat, \rShelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds \rAt loop-holes cut through thickest shade. Those leaves 1 1 10 \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. \r\r\r\r2/1 \r\r\r\rThey gathered, broad as Amazonian targe, \rAnd with what skill they had together sewed, \rf To gird their waist va.in_covering ? if to hide \rj Their guilt and dreaded_jshame ! Oh how unlike \rLTo that first naked glory! Such of late \rColumbus found the American, so girt \rWith feathered cincture, naked else and wild \rAmong the trees on isles and woody shores. \rThus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part \rCovered, but not at rest or ease of mind, 1120 \r\rThej/_sat them down to weep ; nor only tears \rRained at their eyes, but high winds worse within \rBegan to rise, high passions, an^er, hate, \rMistrust, suspicion, discord, and shook sore \r\r\r\rrheir inward state of mind, calm region once \r\r\r\rAnd full of peace, now tost and turbulent - v \r\r\r\rFor Understanding ruled not, and the Wi \r\r\r\rA \r\r\' Heard not her lore, both in subjection now \rTo sensual Appetite, who, from beneath \rUsurping over sovran ^Reason, claimed 1130 \r\rSuperior sway. From thus distempered breast \rAdam, estranged in look and altered ^tyie^. \rSpeech intermitted thus to Eve renewed: \r~ "WouIbTthou hadst heartened to my words, and stayed \rWith me, as I besought thee, when that strange \rDesire of wandering, this unhappy morn, \rI know not whence possessed thee ! we had then \rRemained still happy, not, as now, despoiled \rOf^ all our good, shamed, naked, miserable 1 \rLet none henceforth seek needless cause to approve 1140 \rThe faith they owe; when earnestly they seek \rSuch proof, conclude, they then begin to fail." \r\rTo whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve: \r\r\r\r2-J2 PARADISE LOST. \r\r" What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe ! \rImput\'st thou that to my default, or will \rOf wandering, as thou call\'st it, which who knows \rBut might as ill have happened, thou being by, \rOr to thyself perhaps? _Hadst thou been there, \rOr here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned \rFraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; 1 1 50 \r\rNo ground of enmity between us known, \rWhy he should mean me ill, or seek to harm. \rWas I to have never parted from thy side? \rAs good have grown there still, a lifeless rib. \rBeing as I am, whvdidst not thou, the head, \rCommand me absolutely not tb~ go, \rGoing into such danger, as thou saidst? \rToo facile then, thou didst not much gainsay, \rNay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. \rHadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent, 1160 \r\rNeither had I transgressed, nor thou with me." \rTo whom, then first incensed, Adam replied: \r"Is this the love, is this the recompense \rOf mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, expressed \rImmutable when thou wert lost, not I, \rWho might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss, \rYet willmgry chose- rather -death with thee ? \r\r\r\rAnd am I now upbraided as the cause \r\'Of thy transgressing ? not enough severe, \rIt seems, in thy restraint!

Thus it shall befall \r\rHim who, to worth in women overtrusting, \r\rLets her will rule: restraint she will not brook; \r\rAnd, left to herself, if evil thence ensue, \r\rShe first his weak indulgence will accuse." \r\rThus they in mutual accusation spent \rThe fruitless hours, but^ neither self-condemning; \rpf their vain cpqtest app^nr^d nn gpH. \r\r\r\rP. L. l8 \r\r\r\rBOOK X. \r\r\r\r1 8 \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\r\r\rMan\'s transgression known, the guardian Angels forsake Paradise, \rand return up to Heaven to approve their vigilance, and are approved ; \rGod declaring that the entrance of Satan could not be by them pre- \rvented. He sends his Son to judge the transgressors ; who descends, \rand gives sentence accordingly; then in pity clothes them both, and \rreascends. Sin and Death, sitting till then at the gates of Hell, by \rwondrous sympathy feeling the success of Satan in this new World, and \rthe sin by Man there committed, resolve to sit no longer confined in \rHell, but to follow Satan, their sire, up to the place of Man. To make \rthe way easier from Hell to this World to and fro, they pave a broad \rhighway or bridge over Chaos, according to the track that Satan first \rmade ; then, preparing for Earth, they meet him, proud of his success, \rreturning to Hell ; their mutual gratulation. Satan arrives at Pande- \rmonium ; in full assembly relates, with boasting, his success against \rMan ; instead of applause is entertained with a general hiss by all his \raudience, transformed, with himself also, suddenly into serpents, ac- \rcording to his doom given in Paradise ; then, deluded with a show of \rthe Forbidden Tree springing up before them, they, greedily reaching \rto take of the fruit, chew dust and bitter ashes. The proceedings of \rSin and Death : God foretells the final victory of his Son over them, \rand the renewing of all things ; but for the present commands his \rAngels to make several alterations in the heavens and elements. Adam, \rmore and more perceiving his fallen condition, heavily bewails, rejects \rthe condolement of Eve; she persists, and at length appeases him: \rthen, to evade the curse likely to fall on their offspring, proposes to \rAdam violent ways, which he approves not, but, conceiving better hope, \rputs her in mind of the late promise made them, that her seed should \rbe revenged on the Serpent, and exhorts her, with him, to seek peace \rof the offended Deity by repentance and supplication. \r\r\r\rBOOK X. \r\r\r\rMEANWHILE the heino&s and despiteful act \rOf Satan done in Paradise, and how \rHe, in the Serpent, had perverted Eve, \rHer husband she, to taste the fatal fruit, \rWas known in Heaven ; for what can scape the eye \rOf God all-seeing, or deceive his heart \rOmniscient? who, in all things wise and just, \rHindered not Satan to attempt the mind \rOf Man, with strength entire and free will armed, \rComplete to have discovered and repulsed 10 \r\rWhatever wiles of foe or seeming friend. \rFor still they knew, and ought to have still remembered, \rThe high injunction not to taste that fruit, \rWhoever tempted; which they not obeying \rIncurred (what could they less ?) the penalty, \rAnd, manifold in sin, deserved to fall. \r\rUp into Heaven from Paradise in haste \rThe Angelic guards ascended, mute and sad \rFor Man; for of his state by this they .knew, \rMuch wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen 20 \rEntrance unseen. Soon as the unwelcome news \rFrom Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased \r\r\r\r278 PARADISE LOST. \r\rAll were who heard; dim sadness did not spare \r\rThat time celestial visages, yet, mixed \r\rWith pity, violated not their bliss. \r\rAbout the new-arrived, in multitudes, \r\rThe ethereal people ran, to hear and know \r\rHow all befell. They towards the throne supreme \r\rAccountable made haste to make appear \r\rWith righteous plea their utmost vigilance, 30 \r\rAnd easily approved; when the Most High \r\rEternal Father, from his secret cloud ; \r\rAmidst, in thunder uttered thus his voice : \r\r"Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned \rFrom unsuccessful charge, be not dismayed, \rNor troubled at these tidings from the Earth, \rWhich your sincerest care could not prevent, \rForetold so lately what would come to pass, \rWhen first this Tempter crossed the gulf from Hell. \rI told ye then he should prevail and speed 40 \r\rOn his bad errand ; Man should be seduced \rAnd flattered out of all, believing lies \rAgainst his Maker; no decree of mine \rConcurring to necessitate his fall, \rOr touch with lightest moment of impulse \rHis free will, to her own inclining left \rIn even scale. But fallen he is; and now \rWhat rests, but that the mortal sentence pass \rOn his transgression, death denounced that day? \rWhich he presumes already vain and void, 50 \r\rBecause not yet inflicted, as he feared, \rBy some immediate stroke; but soon shall find \rForbearance no acquittance ere day end : \rJustice shall not return, as bounty, scorned. \rBut whom send I to judge them ? whom but thee, \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 279 \r\rVicegerent Son? to thee I have transferred \r\rAll judgment, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell. \r\rEasy it may be seen that I intend \r\rMercy colleague with justice, sending thee, \r\rMan\'s friend, his Mediator, his designed 60 \r\rBoth ransom and Redeemer voluntary, \r\rAnd destined Man himself to judge Man fallen." \r\rSo spake the Father; and, unfolding bright \rToward the right hand his glory, on the Son \rBlazed forth unclouded deity; he full \rResplendent all his Father manifest \rExpressed, and thus divinely answered mild : \r\r" Father Eternal, thine is to decree, \rMine both in Heaven and Earth to do thy will \rSupreme, that thou in me, thy Son beloved, 70 \r\rMay\'st ever rest well pleased. I go to judge \rOn Earth these thy transgressors; but thou know\'st, \rWhoever judged, the worst on me must light, \rWhen time shall be; for so I undertook \rBefore thee, and, not repenting, this obtain \rOf right, that I may mitigate their doom \rOn me derived; yet I shall temper so \rJustice with mercy, as may illustrate most \rThem fully satisfied, and thee appease. \rAttendance none shall need, nor train, where none 80 \rAre to behold the judgment but the judged, \rThose two; the third best absent is condemned, \rConvict by flight, and rebel to all law: \rConviction to the Serpent none belongs." \r\rThus saying, from his radiant seat he rose \rOf high collateral glory; Him Thrones and Powers, \rPrincedoms, and Dominations ministrant \rAccompanied to Heaven-gate, from whence \r\r\r\r28O PARADISE LOST. \r\rEden and all the coast in prospect lay. \r\rDown he descended straight; the speed of Gods 90 \r\rTime counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged. \r\rNow was the sun in western cadence low \rFrom noon, and gentle airs due at their hour \rTo fan the Earth now waked, and usher in \rThe evening cool, when he, from wrath more cool, \rCame, the mild Judge and Intercessor both, \rTo sentence Man. The voice of God they heard \rNow walking in the garden, by soft winds \rBrought to their ears, while day declined; they heard, \rAnd from his presence hid themselves among 100 \r\rThe thickest trees, both man and wife, till God, \rApproaching, thus to Adam called aloud: \r\r"Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet \rMy coming seen far off? I miss thee here, \rNot pleased, thus entertained with solitude, \rWhere obvious duty erewhile appeared unsought. \rOr come I less conspicuous, or what change \rAbsents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth." \r\rHe came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first \rTo offend, discountenanced both, and discomposed; no \rLove was not in their looks, either to God \rOr to each other, but apparent guilt, \rAnd shame, and perturbation, and despair, \rAnger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile. \rWhence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief: \r\r"I heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice \rAfraid, being naked, hid myself." To whom \rThe gracious Judge without revile replied : \r\r"My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feared, \rBut still rejoiced; how is it now become 120 \r\rSo dreadful to thee? That thou art naked, who \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 28l \r\rHath told thee? Hast thou eaten of the tree, \r\rWhereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?" \rTo whom thus Adam, sore beset, replied: \r"O Heaven 1 in evil strait this day I stand \r\rBefore my Judge either to undergo \r\rMyself the total crime, or to accuse \r\rMy other self, the partner of my life; \r\rWhose failing, while her faith to me remains, \r\rI should conceal, and not expose to blame 130 \r\rBy my complaint; but strict necessity \r\rSubdues me, and calamitous constraint, \r\rLest on my head both sin and punishment, \r\rHowever insupportable, be all \r\rDevolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou \r\rWouldst easily detect what I conceal. \r\rThis woman, whom thou mad\'st to be my help, \r\rAnd gav\'st me as thy perfect gift, so good, \r\rSo fit, so acceptable, so divine, \r\rThat from her hand I could suspect no ill, 140 \r\rf And what she did, whatever in itself, \r\rHer doing seemed to justify the deed; \r\rShe gave me of the tree, and I did eat." \rTo whom the Sovran Presence thus replied: \r"Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey \r\rBefore his voice? or was she made thy guide, \r\rSuperior, or but equal, that to her \r\rThou didst resign thy manhood, and the place \r\rWherein God set thee above her, made of thee \r\rAnd for thee, whose perfection far excelled 150 \r\rHers in all real dignity? Adorned \r\rShe was indeed, and lovely, to attract \r\rThy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts \r\rWere such as under government well seemed, \r\r\r\r282 PARADISE LOST. \r\rUnseemly to bear rule; which was thy part \rAnd person, hadst thou known thyself aright." \r\rSo having said, he thus to Eve in few : \r"Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done?" \r\rTo whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed, \rConfessing soon, yet not before her Judge 160 \r\rBold or loquacious, thus abashed replied: \r"The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat." \r\rWhich when the Lord God heard, without delay \rTo judgment he proceeded on the accused \rSerpent, though brute, unable to transfer \rThe guilt on him who made him instrument \rOf mischief, and polluted from the end \rOf his creation; justly then accursed, \rAs vitiated in nature. More to know \rConcerned not Man (since he no further knew), 170 \r\rNor altered his offence; yet God at last \rTo Satan, first in sin, his doom applied, \rThough in mysterious terms, judged as then best; \rAnd on the Serpent thus his curse let fall: \r\r"Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed \rAbove all cattle, each beast of the field; \rUpon thy belly grovelling thou shalt go, \rAnd dust shalt eat all the days of thy life. \rBetween thee and the Woman I will put \rEnmity, and between thine and her seed; 180 \r\rHer seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel." \r\rSo spake this oracle, then verified \rWhen Jesus, son of Mary, second Eve, \rSaw Satan fall like lightning down from Heaven, \rPrince of the air; then, rising from his grave, \rSpoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed \rIn open show, and with ascension bright \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 283 \r\rCaptivity led captive through the air, \rThe realm itself of Satan long usurped, \rWhom he shall tread at last under our feet; 190 \r\rEven he who now foretold his fatal bruise, \rAnd to the Woman thus his sentence turned: \rr \' "Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply \rBy thy conception ; children thou shalt bring \rIn sorrow forth; and to thy husband\'s will \rThine shall submit; he over thee shall rule." \r\rOn Adam last thus judgment he pronounced: \r" Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, \rAnd eaten of the tree, concerning which \rI charged thee, saying, \'Thou shalt not eat thereof,\' 200 \rCurs\'d is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow \rShalt eat thereof all the days of thy life ; \rThorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth \rUnbid ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ; \rIn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, \rTill thou return unto the ground; for thou \rOut of the ground wast taken : know thy birth, \rFor dust thou art, and shalt to dust return." \r\rSo judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, \rAnd the instant stroke of death, denounced that day, 210 \rRemoved far off; then, pitying how they stood \rBefore him naked to the air, that now \rMust suffer change, disdained not to begin \rThenceforth the form of servant to assume; \rAs when he washed his servants\' feet, so now, \rAs father of his family, he clad \rTheir nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain, \rOr as the snake with youthful coat repaid; \rAnd thought not much to clothe his enemies. \rNor he their outward only with the skins 220 \r\r\r\r284 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOf beasts, but inward nakedness, much more \rOpprobrious, with his robe of righteousness \rArraying, covered from his Father\'s sight. \rTo him with swift ascent he up returned, \rInto his blissful bosom reassumed \rIn glory as of old; to him appeased, \rAll, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man \rRecounted, mixing intercession sweet. \rf~~ Meanwhile, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth, \r\' Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death, 230 \r\rIn counterview within the gates, that now \rStood open wide, belching outrageous flame \rFar into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through, \rSin opening ; who thus now to Death began : \r* " O Son, why sit we here each other viewing \rIdly, while Satan, our great author, thrives \rIn other worlds, and happier seat provides \rFor us, his offspring dear? It cannot be . \rBut that success attends him ; if mishap, \rEre this he had returned, with fury driven 240 \r\rBy his avengers, since no place like this \rCan fit his punishment, or their revenge. \rMethinks I feel new strength within me rise, \rWings growing, and dominion given me large \rBeyond this Deep, whatever draws me on, \rOr sympathy, or some connatural force, \rPowerful at greatest distance to unite \rWith secret amity things of like kind \rBy secretest conveyance. Thou, my shade \rInseparable, must with me along; 250 \r\rFor Death from Sin no power can separate. \rBut, lest the difficulty of passing back \rStay his return perhaps over this gulf \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 285 \r\rImpassable, impervious, let us try \r\rAdventurous work, yet to thy power and mine \r\rNot unagreeable, to found a path \r\rOver this main from Hell to that new World \r\rWhere Satan now prevails ; a monument \r\rOf merit high to all the infernal host, \r\rEasing their passage hence, for intercourse 260 \r\rOr transmigration, as their lot shall lead. \r\rNor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn \r\rBy this new-felt attraction and instinct." \r\rWhom thus the meagre Shadow answered soon : \r"Go whither fate and inclination strong \rLeads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err \rThe way, thou leading ; such a scent I draw \rOf carnage, prey innumerable, and taste \rThe savour of death from all things there that live. \rNor shall I to the work thou enterprisest 270 \r\rBe wanting, but afford thee equal aid." \r\rSo saying, with delight he snuffed the smell \rOf mortal change on Earth. As when a flock \rOf ravenous fowl, though many a league remote, \rAgainst the day of battle, to a field, \rWhere armies lie encamped, come flying, lured \rWith scent of living carcases designed \rFor death the following day in bloody fight: \rSo scented the grim Feature, and upturned \rHis nostril wide into the murky air, 280 \r\rSagacious of his quarry from so far. \rThen both, from out Hell- gates, into the waste \rWide anarchy of Chaos damp and dark \rFlew diverse, and with power (their power was great) \rHovering upon the waters, what they met \rSolid or slimy, as in raging sea \r\r\r\r286 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTossed up and down, together crowded drove, \r\rFrom each side shoaling, towards the mouth of Hell ; \r\rAs when two polar winds, blowing adverse \r\rUpon the Cronian sea, together drive 290 \r\rMountains of ice, that stop the imagined way \r\rBeyond Petsora eastward, to the rich \r\rCathaian coast. The aggregated soil \r\rDeath with his mace petrific, cold and dry, \r\rAs with a trident smote, and fixed as firm \r\rAs Delos, floating once; the rest his look \r\rBound with Gorgonian rigour not to move, \r\rAnd with asphaltic slime; broad as the gate \r\rDeep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach \r\rThey fastened, and the mole immense wrought on 300 \r\rOver the foaming Deep high-arched, a bridge \r\rOf length prodigious, joining to the wall \r\rImmovable of this now fenceless World, \r\rForfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, \r\rSmooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell. \r\rSo, if great things to small may be compared, \r\rXerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke, \r\rFrom Susa, his Memnonian palace high, \r\rCame to the sea, and, over Hellespont \r\rBridging his way, Europe with Asia joined, 310 \r\rAnd scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves. \r\rNow had they brought the work by wondrous art \r\rPontifical, a ridge of pendent rock, \r\rOver the vexed Abyss, following the track \r\rOf Satan, to the self-same place where he \r\rFirst lighted from his wing, and landed safe \r\rFrom out of Chaos, to the outside bare \r\rOf this round World. With pins of adamant \r\rAnd chains they made all fast, too fast they made \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 287 \r\rAnd durable; and now in little space 320 \r\rThe confines met of empyrean Heaven \r\rAnd of this World, and on the left hand Hell \r\rWith long reach interposed; three several ways, \r\rIn sight, to each of these three places led. \r\rAnd now their way to Earth they had descried, \r\rTo Paradise first tending, when, behold \r\rSatan, in likeness of an Angel bright, \r\rBetwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering \r\rHis zenith, while the sun in Aries rose ! \r\rDisguised he came; but those his children dear 330 \r\rTheir parent soon discerned, though in disguise. \r\rHe, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk \r\rInto the wood fast by, and, changing shape \r\rTo observe the sequel, saw his guileful act \r\rBy Eve, though all unweeting, seconded \r\rUpon her husband, saw their shame that sought \r\rVain covertures; bat when he saw descend \r\rThe Son of God to judge them, terrified \r\rHe fled, not hoping to escape, but shun \r\rThe present, fearing guilty what his wrath 340 \r\rMight suddenly inflict; that past, returned \r\rBy night, and listening where the hapless pair \r\rSat in their sad discourse and various plaint, \r\rThence gathered his own doom; which understood \r\rNot instant, but of future time, with joy L -, \r\rAnd tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned, / \r\rAnd at the brink of Chaos, near the foot \r\rOf this new wondrous pontifice, unhoped \r\rMet who to meet him came, his offspring dear. \r\rGreat joy was at their meeting, and at sight 350 \r\rOf that stupendous bridge his joy increased. \r\rLong he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair \r\r\r\r288 PARADISE LOST. \r\rEnchanting daughter, thus the silence broke: \r\r"O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, \rThy trophies, which thou view\'st as not thine own; \rThou art their author and prime architect; \rFor I no sooner in my heart divined \r(My heart, which by a secret harmony \rStill moves with thine, joined in connexion swtct) \rThat thou on Earth hadst prospered, which thy looks 360 \rNow also evidence, but straight I felt, \rThough distant from thee worlds between, yet felt \rThat I must after thee with this thy son; \rSuch fatal consequence unites us three. \rHell could no longer hold us in her bounds, \rNor this unvoyageable gulf obscure \rDetain from following thy illustrious track. \rThou hast achieved our liberty, confined \rWithin Hell-gates till now; thou us empowered \rTo fortify thus far, and overlay 370 \r\rWith this portentous bridge the dark Abyss. \rThine now is all this World; thy virtue hath won \rWhat thy hands builded not, thy wisdom gained \rWith odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged \rOur foil in Heaven : here thou shalt monarch reign, \rThere didst not; there let him still victor sway, \rAs battle hath adjudged, from this new World \rRetiring, by his own doom alienated, \rAnd henceforth monarchy with thee divide \rOf all things, parted by the empyreal bounds, 380 \r\rHis quadrature, from thy orbicular World, \rOr try thee now more dangerous to his throne." \r\rWhom thus the Prince of Darkness answered glad : \r| " Fair daughter, and thou son and grandchild both, \r| High proof ye now have given to be the race \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 289 \r\rOf Satan (for I glory in the name, \r\rAntagonist of Heaven\'s Almighty King), \r\rAmply have merited of me, of all \r\rThe infernal empire, that so near Heaven\'s door \r\rTriumphal with triumphal act have met, 390 \r\rMine with this glorious work, and made one realm \r\rHell and this World one realm, one continent \r\rOf easy thoroughfare. Therefore, while I \r\rDescend through darkness, on your road with ease, \r\rTo my associate Powers, them to acquaint \r\rWith these successes, and with them rejoice, \r\rYou two this way, among these numerous orbs, \r\rAll yours, right down to Paradise descend ; \r\rThere dwell and reign in bliss ; thence on the Earth \r\rDominion exercise and in the air, 400 \r\rChiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared; \r\rHim first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. \r\rMy substitutes I send ye, and create \r\rPlenipotent on Earth, of matchless might \r\rIssuing from me : on yo.ur joint vigour now \r\rMy hold of this new kingdom all depends, \r\rThrough Sin to Death exposed by my exploit. \r\rIf your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell \r\rNo detriment need fear; go, and be strong." \r\rSo saying, he dismissed them; they with speed 410 \rTheir course through thickest constellations held, \rSpreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan, \rAnd planets, planet-struck, real eclipse \rThen suffered. The other way Satan went down \rThe causey to Hell-gate; on either side \rDisparted Chaos over-built exclaimed, \rAnd with rebounding surge the bars assailed, \rThat scorned his indignation. Through the gate, \r\rP. L. I9 \r\r\r\r290 PARADISE LOST. \r\rWide open and unguarded, Satan passed, \r\rAnd all about found desolate; for those 420 \r\rAppointed to sit there had left their charge, \r\rFlown to the upper World; the rest were all \r\rFar to the inland retired, about the walls \r\rOf Pandemonium, city and proud seat \r\rOf Lucifer, so by allusion called \r\rOf that bright star to Satan paragoned; \r\rThere kept their watch the legions, while the Grand \r\rIn council sat, solicitous what chance \r\rMight intercept their Emperor sent; so he \r\rDeparting gave command, and they observed. 430 \r\rAs when the Tartar from his Russian foe, \r\rBy Astracan, over the snowy plains \r\rRetires, or Bactrian Sophi, from the horns \r\rOf Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond \r\rThe realm of Aladule, in his retreat \r\rTo Tauris or Casbeen: so these, the late \r\rHeaven-banished host, left desert utmost Hell \r\rMany a dark league, reduced in careful watch \r\rRound their metropolis, and now expecting \r\rEach hour their great adventurer from the search 440 \r\rOf foreign worlds. He through the midst unmarked, \r\rIn show plebeian Angel militant \r\rOf lowest order, passed ; and, from the door \r\rOf that Plutonian hall, invisible \r\rAscended his high throne, which, under state \r\rOf richest texture spread, at the upper end \r\rWas placed in regal lustre. Down a while \r\rHe sat, and round about him saw unseen. \r\rAt last, as from a cloud, his fulgent head \r\rAnd shape star-bright appeared, or brighter, clad 450 \r\rWith what permissive glory since his fall \r\r\r\rBOOK X. \r\r\r\r2 9 I \r\r\r\rWas left him, or false glitter. All amazed \rAt that so sudden blaze, the Stygian throng \rBent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld, \rTheir mighty Chief returned : loud was the acclaim. \rForth rushed in haste the great consulting peers, \rRaised from their dark divan, and with like joy \rCongratulant approached him, who with hand \rSilence, and with these words attention, won: \r\r"Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers ! 460 \rFor in possession such, not only of right, \rI call ye, and declare ye now, returned, \rSuccessful beyond hope, to lead ye forth \rTriumphant out of this infernal pit \rAbominable, accursed, the house of woe, \rAnd dungeon of our tyrant ! Now possess, \rAs lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven \rLittle inferior, by my adventure hard \rWith peril great achieved. Long were to tell \rWhat I have done, what suffered, with what pain 470 \rVoyaged the unreal, vast^ unbounded Deep \rOf horrible confusion, over which \rBy Sin and Death a broad way now is paved, \rTo expedite your glorious march; but I \rToiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride \rThe untractable Abyss, plunged in the womb \rOf unoriginal Night and Chaos wild, \rThat, jealous of their secrets, fiercely opposed \rMy journey strange, with clamorous uproar \rProtesting Fate supreme; thence how I found 480 \r\rThe new-created World, which fame in Heaven \rLong had foretold, a fabric wonderful, \rOf absolute perfection; therein Man \rPlaced in a Paradise, by our exile \r\r19 2 \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. \r\rMade happy. Him by fraud I have seduced \r\rFrom his Creator, and, the more to increase \r\rYour wonder, with an apple! He, thereat \r\rOffended worth your laughter ! hath given up \r\rBoth his beloved Man and all his World \r\rTo Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, \r\rWithout our hazard, labour, or alarm, \r\rTo range in, and to dwell, and over Man \r\rTo rule, as over all he should have ruled. \r\rTrue is, me also he hath judged, or rather \r\rMe not, but the brute serpent, in whose shape \r\rMan I deceived: that which to me belongs \r\rIs enmity, which he will put between \r\rMe and mankind; I am to bruise his heel; \r\rHis seed when is not set shall bruise my head : \r\rA world who would not purchase with a bruise, \r\rOr much more grievous pain? Ye have the account \r\rOf my performance ; what remains, ye Gods, \r\rBut up and enter now into full bliss?" \r\rSo having said, a while he stood, expecting \rTheir universal shout and high applause \rTo fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears, \rOn all sides, from innumerable tongues, \rA dismal universal hiss, the sound \rOf public scorn. He wondered, but not long . \rHad leisure, wondering at himself now more; 51 \r\rHis visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, \rHis arms clung to his ribs, his legs entwining \rEach other, till, supplanted, down he fell \rA monstrous serpent on his belly prone, \rReluctant, but in vain; a greater power \rNow ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned, \rAccording to his doom. He would have spoke, \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 293 \r\rBut hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue \r\rTo forked tongue; for now were all transformed \r\rAlike, to serpents all, as accessories 520 \r\rTo his bold riot. Dreadful was the din \r\rOf hissing through the hall, thick-swarming now \r\rWith complicated monsters, head and tail, \r\rScorpion, and asp, and amphisbasna dire, \r\rCerastes horned, hydrus, and ellops drear, \r\rAnd dipsas (not so thick swarmed once the soil \r\rBedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle \r\rOphiusa); but still greatest he the midst, \r\rNow dragon grown, larger than whom the sun \r\rEngendered in the Pythian vale on slime, 530 \r\rHuge Python; and his power no less he seemed \r\rAbove the rest still to retain. They all \r\rHim followed, issuing forth to the open field, \r\rWhere all yet left of that revolted rout, \r\rHeaven-fallen, in station stood or just array, \r\rSublime with expectation when to see \r\rIn triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief; \r\rThey saw, but other sight instead, a crowd \r\rOf ugly serpents ! Horror on them fell, \r\rAnd horrid sympathy; for what they saw 540 \r\rThey felt themselves now changing : down their arms, \r\rDown fell both spear and shield; down they as fast, \r\rAnd the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form \r\rCatched by contagion, like in punishment, \r\rAs in their crime. Thus was the applause they meant \r\rTurned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame \r\rCast on themselves from their own mouths. There stood \r\rA grove hard by, sprung up with this their change, \r\rHis will who reigns above, to aggravate \r\rTheir penance, laden with fair fruit, like that 550 \r\r\r\r294 PARADISE LOST. \r\rWhich grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve \rUsed by the Tempter. On that prospect strange \rTheir earnest eyes they fixed, imagining \rFor one forbidden tree a multitude \rNow risen, to work them further woe or shame; \rYet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce, \rThough to delude them sent, could not abstain, \rBut on they rolled in heaps, and, up the trees \rClimbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks \rThat curled Megaera. Greedily they plucked 560 \r\rThe fruitage fair to sight, like that which grew \rNear that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed; \rThis, more delusive, not the touch, but taste \rDeceived; they, fondly thinking to allay \rTheir appetite with gust, instead of fruit \rChewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste \rWith spattering noise rejected. Oft they assayed, \rHunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft, \rWith hatefulest disrelish writhed their jaws, \rWith soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell 570 \r\rInto the same illusion, not as Man \r\rWhom they triumphed once lapsed. Thus were they plagued \rAnd worn with famine long, and ceaseless hiss, \rTill their lost shape, permitted, they resumed; \rYearly enjoined, some say, to undergo \rThis annual humbling certain numbered days, \rTo dash their pride, and joy for Man seduced. \rHowever, some tradition they dispersed \rAmong the heathen of their purchase got, \rAnd fabled how the Serpent, whom they called 580 \r\rOphion, with Eurynome (the wide- \rEncroaching Eve perhaps), had first the rule \rOf high Olympus, thence by Saturn driven \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 295 \r\rAnd Ops, ere yet Dictsean Jove was born. \rMeanwhile in Paradise the Hellish pair \r\rToo soon arrived; Sin there in power before, \r\rOnce actual, now in body, and to dwell \r\rHabitual habitant; behind her Death, \r\rClose following pace for pace, not mounted yet \r\rOn his pale horse ; to whom Sin thus began : 590 \r\r" Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death ! \r\rWhat think\'st thou of our empire now, though earned \r\rWith travail difficult? not better far \r\rThan still at Hell\'s dark threshold to have sat watch, \r\rUnnamed, undreaded, and thyself half-starved ? " \rWhom thus the Sin-born Monster answered soon : \r\r"To me, who with eternal famine pine, \r\rAlike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven; \r\rThere best, where most with ravin I may meet; \r\rWhich here, though plenteous, all too little seems 600 \r\rTo stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corpse." \r\rTo whom the incestuous Mother thus replied: \r"Thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flowers, \rFeed first; on each beast next, and fish, and fowl, \rNo homely morsels; and whatever thing \rThe scythe of Time mows down devour unspared; \rTill I, in Man residing, through the race, \rHis thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect, \rAnd season him thy last and sweetest prey." \r\rThis said, they both betook them several ways, 610 \rBoth to destroy, or unimmortal make \rAll kinds, and for destruction to mature \rSooner or later ; which the Almighty seeing, \rFrom his transcendent seat the Saints among, \rTo those bright Orders uttered thus his voice: \r"See with what heat these dogs of Hell advance \r\r\r\r296 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTo waste and havoc yonder World, which I \r\rSo fair and good created, and had still \r\rKept in that state, had not the folly of Man \r\rLet in these wasteful furies, who impute 620 \r\rFolly to me (so doth the Prince of Hell \r\rAnd his adherents), that with so much ease \r\rI suffer them to enter and possess \r\rA place so heavenly, and conniving seem \r\rTo gratify my scornful enemies, \r\rThat laugh, as if, transported with some fit \r\rOf passion, I to them had quitted all, \r\rAt random yielded up to their misrule; \r\rAnd know not that I called and drew them thither, \r\rMy Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth 630 \r\rWhich Man\'s polluting sin with taint hath shed \r\rOn what was pure; till, crammed and gorged, nigh burst \r\rWith sucked and glutted offal, at one sling \r\rOf thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son, \r\rBoth Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last, \r\rThrough Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell \r\rFor ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws. \r\rThen Heaven and Earth, renewed, shall be made pure \r\rTo sanctity that shall receive no stain : \r\rTill then the curse pronounced on both precedes." 640 \r\rHe ended, and the Heavenly audience loud \rSung Halleluiah, as the sound of seas, \rThrough multitude that sung : " Just are thy ways, \rRighteous are thy decrees on all thy works; \rWho can extenuate thee?" Next, to the Son, \rDestined restorer of mankind, by whom \rNew Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise, \rOr down from Heaven descend. Such was their song, \rWhile the Creator, calling forth by name \r\r\r\rBOOK X. ?99 \r\rHis mighty Angels, gave them several charge, 650 \r\rAs sorted best with present things. The sun \r\rHad first his precept so to move, so shine, \r\rAs might affect the Earth with cold and heat \r\rScarce tolerable, and from the north to call \r\rDecrepit winter, from the south to bring \r\rSolstitial summer\'s heat. To the blanc moon \r\rHer office they prescribed; to the other five \r\rTheir planetary motions and aspects, \r\rIn sextile, square, and trine, and opposite, \r\rOf noxious efficacy, and when to join 660 \r\rIn synod unbenign ; and taught the fixed \r\rTheir influence malignant when to shower; \r\rWhich of them rising with the sun, or falling, \r\rShould prove tempestuous. To the winds they set \r\rTheir corners, when with bluster to confound \r\rSea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll \r\rWith terror through the dark aerial hall. \r\rSome say he bid his Angels turn askance \r\rThe poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more \r\rFrom the sun\'s axle; they with labour pushed 670 \r\rOblique the centric globe : some say the sun \r\rWas bid turn reins from the equinoctial road \r\rLike distant breadth to Taurus with the seven \r\rAtlantic Sisters, and the Spartan Twins, \r\rUp to the Tropic Crab; thence down amain \r\rBy Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, \r\rAs deep as Capricorn ; to bring in change \r\rOf seasons to each clime : else had the spring \r\rPerpetual smiled on Earth with vernant flowers, \r\rEqual in days and nights, except to those 680 \r\rBeyond the polar circles; to them day \r\rHad unbenighted shone, while the low sun, \r\r\r\r296 \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. \r\r\r\rTo recompense his distance, in their sight \r\rHad rounded still the horizon, and not known \r\rOr east or west; which had forbid the snow \r\rFrom cold Estotiland, and south as far \r\rBeneath Magellan. At that tasted fruit \r\rThe sun, as from Thyestean banquet, turned \r\rHis course intended: else how had the World \r\rInhabited, though sinless, more than now 690 \r\rAvoided pinching cold and scorching heat? \r\rThese changes in the heavens, though slow, produced \r\rLike change on sea and land, sideral blast, \r\rVapour, and mist, and exhalation hot, \r\rCorrupt and pestilent. Now from the north \r\rOf Norumbega, and the Samoed shore, \r\rBursting their brazen dungeon, armed with ice \r\rAnd snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw, \r\rBoreas and Csecias and Argestes loud \r\rAnd Thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn ; 700 \r\rWith adverse blasts upturns them from the south \r\rNotus and Afer black with thundrous clouds \r\rFrom Serraliona; thwart of these, as fierce \r\rForth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds, \r\rEurus and Zephyr with their lateral noise, \r\rSirocco, and L\'ibecchio. Thus began \r\rOutrage from lifeless things ; but Discord first, \r\rDaughter of Sin, among the irrational \r\rDeath introduced through fierce antipathy : \r\rBeast now with beast \'gan war, and fowl with fowl, 710 \r\rAnd fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving \r\rDevoured each other; nor stood much in awe \r\rOf Man, but fled him, or with countenance grim \r\rGlared on him passing. These were from without \r\rThe growing miseries, which Adam saw \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 299 \r\rAlready in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, \rTo sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within, \rAnd, in a troubled sea of passion tost, \rThus^ to disburden sought with sad complaint : \r\r"O miserable of happy! is this the end 720 \r\rOf this new glorious World, and me so late \rThe glory of that glory? who now, become \rAccursed of blessed, hide me from the face \rOf God, whom to behold was then my highth \rOf happiness ! Yet well, if here would end \rThe misery; I deserved it, and would bear \rMy own deservings ; but this will not serve : \rAll that I eat or drink, or shall beget, \r\r: Is propagated curse. O voice, once heard \rj Delightfully, \'Increase and multiply\'; 730 \r\rV Now death to hear ! for what can I increase \r\r^Or multiply, but curses on my head? \rWho, of all ages to succeed, but, feeling \rThe evil on him brought by me, will curse \r\rI My head ? * 111 fare our Ancestor impure ! \rFor this we may thank- Adam ! \' but his thanks \rShall be the execration ; so, besides \rMine own that bide upon me, all from me \rShall with a fierce reflux on me redound, \rOn me, as on their natural centre, light 740 \r\rHeavy, though in their place. O fleeting joys \r\rI Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes ! \rDid I request thee, Maker, from my clay \rTo mould me Man? did I solicit thee \rFrom darkness to promote me, or here place \rIn this delicious garden? As my will \rConcurred not to my being, it were but right \rAnd equal to reduce me to my dust, \r\r\r\r300 PARADISE LOST. \r\rDesirous to resign and render back \r\rAll I received, unable to perform 750 \r\rThy terms too hard, by which I was to hold \rThe good I sought not. To the loss of that, \rSufficient penalty, why hast thou added \rThe sense of endless woes? inexplicable \rThy justice seems. Yet, to say truth, too late \rI thus contest; then should have been refused \rThose terms whatever, when they were proposed. \rThou didst accept them : wilt thou enjoy the good, \rThen cavil the conditions? And though God \rMade thee without thy leave, what if thy son 760 \r\rProve disobedient, and, reproved, retort, \r\'Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it notl* \rWouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee \rThat proud excuse? yet him not thy election, \rBut natural necessity, begot. \r\rGod made thee of choice his own, and of his own \rTo serve him ; thy reward was of his grace ; \rThy punishment then justly is at his will. \rBe it so, for I submit ; his doom is fair, \rThat dust I am, and shall to dust return. 770 \r\rO welcome hour whenever ! Why delays \rHis hand to execute what his decree \rFixed on this day? Why do I overlive? \rWhy am I mocked with death, and lengthened out \rTo deathless pain? How gladly would I meet \rMortality, my sentence, and be earth \rInsensible ! how glad would lay me down \rAs in my mother\'s lap ! There I should rest \r:And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more \rWould thunder in my ears ; no fear of worse 780 \r\rTo me and to my offspring would torment me \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 301 \r\rWith cruel expectation. Yet one doubt \r\rPursues me still, lest all I cannot die; \r\rI.est that pure breath of life, the spirit of Man \r\rWhich God inspired, cannot together perish \r\rWith this corporeal clod; then, in the grave, \r\rOr in some other dismal place, who knows \r\rBut I shall die a living death? O thought \r\rHorrid, if true ! Yet why? It was but breath \r\rOf life that sinned : what dies but what had life 790 \r\rAnd sin? the body properly hath neither. \r\rAll of me then shall die: let this appease \r\rThe doubt, since human reach no further knows. \r\rFor though the Lord of all be infinite, \r\rIs his wrath also? Be it, Man is not so, \r\rBut mortal doomed. How can he exercise \r\rWrath without end on Man, whom death must end? \r\rCan he make deathless death? That were to make \r\rStrange contradiction ; which to God himself \r\rImpossible is held, as argument 800 \r\rOf weakness, not of power. Will he draw out, \r\rFor anger\'s sake, finite, to infinite \r\rIn punished Man, to satisfy his rigour \r\rSatisfied never? That were to extend \r\rHis sentence beyond dust and Nature\'s law; \r\rBy which all causes else according still \r\rTo the reception of their matter act, \r\rNot to the extent of their own sphere. But say \r\rThat death be not one stroke, as I supposed, \r\rBereaving sense, but endless misery 810 \r\rFrom this day onward, which I feel begun \r\rBoth in me and without me, and so last \r\rTo perpetuity Ay me ! that fear \r\rComes thundering back with dreadful revolution \r\r\r\r\r\r\r302 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOn my defenceless head ! Both Death and I \rAm found eternal, and incorporate both : \rNor I on my part single; in me all \rPosterity stands cursed. Fair patrimony \rThat I must leave ye, sons ! Oh, were I able \rTo waste it all myself, and leave ye none! 820 \r\rSo disinherited, how would ye bless \rMe, now your curse ! Ah, why should all mankind, \rFor one man\'s fault, thus guiltless be condemned, \rIf guiltless ? But from me what can proceed \rBut all corrupt, both mind and will depraved \rNot to do only, but to will the same \rWith me? How can they then acquitted stand \rIn sight of God? Him, after all disputes, \rForced I absolve; all my evasions vain \rAnd reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still 830 \rBut to my own conviction : first and last \rOn me, me only, as the source and spring \rOf all corruption, all the blame lights due; \r; So might the wrath ! Fond wish ! couldst thou support \rThat burden, heavier than the Earth to bear; \rThan all the World much heavier, though divided \rWith that bad woman? Thus, what thou desir\'st, \rAnd what thou fear\'st, alike destroys all hope \rOf refuge, and concludes thee miserable \rBeyond all past example and future; 840 \r\rTo Satan only like, both crime and doom. \r\rConscience ! into what abyss of fears \r\rAnd horrors hast thou driven me; out of which \r\r1 find no way, from deep to deeper plunged!" * \rJ Thus Adam to himself lamented loud \r[Through the still night, not now, as ere Man fell, \rI Wholesome and cool and mild, but with black air \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 303 \r\rAccompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom; \r\rWhich to his evil conscience represented \r\rAll things with double terror. On the ground 850 \r\rOutstretched he lay, on the cold ground, and oft \r\rCursed his creation; Death as oft accused \r\rOf tardy execution, since denounced \r\rThe day of his offence. " Why comes not Death," \r\rSaid he, "with one thrice-acceptable stroke \r\rTo end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, \r\rJustice divine not hasten to be just? \r\rBut Death comes not at call; Justice divine \r\rMends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. \r\rO woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers ! 860 \r\rWith other echo late I taught your shades \r\rTo answer, and resound far other song." \r\rWhom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, \r\rDesolate where she sat, approaching nigh, \r\rSoft words to his fierce passion she assayed; \r\rBut her with stern regard he thus repelled : \r\r" Out of my sight, thou serpent ! that name best \rBefits thee, with him leagued, thyself as false \rAnd hateful : nothing wants, but that thy shape, \rLike his, and colour serpentine, may show 870 \r\rThy inward fraud, to warn all creatures from thee \rHenceforth; lest that too heavenly form, pretended \rTo hellish falsehood, snare them. But for thee \r^ had persisted happy, had not thy pride \rAnd wandering vanity, when least was safe, \rRejected my forewarning, and disdained \rNot to be trusted, longing to be seen, \rThough by the Devil himself, him overweening \rTo overreach; but, with the Serpent meeting, \rFooled and beguiled; by him thou, I by thee, 880 \r\r\r\r304 PARADISE LOST. \r\r\r\rTo trust thee from my side, imagined wise, \r> Constant, mature, proof against all assaults ; \r^ Yy\\nd understood not all was but a show, \rtkather than solid virtue, all but a rib \rCrooked by nature bent, as now appears, \r"More to the part sinister from me drawn; \rWell if thrown out, as supernumerary \rTo my just number found ! Oh, why did God, \rCreator wise, that peopled highest Heaven \rWith Spirits masculine, create at last 890 \r\rThis novelty on Earth, this fair defect \rOf Nature, and not fill the World at once \rWith men, as Angels, without feminine; \rOr find some other way to generate \rMankind? This mischief had not then befallen, \rAnd more that shall befall innumerable \rDisturbances on Earth through female snares, \rPAnd strait conjunction with this sex^. For either \rHe never shall find out fit mate, but such \rAs some misfortune brings him, or mistake; 900 \r\rOr whom he wishes most shall seldom gain, \rThrough her perverseness, but shall see her gained \rBy a far worse, or, if she love, withheld \rBy parents; or his happiest choice too late \rShall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound \rTo a fell adversary, his hate or shame : \rWhich infinite calamity shall cause \rI To human life, and household peace confound." \rHe added not, and from her turned; but Eve, \rNot so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing, 910 \rAnd tresses all disordered, at his feet \rFell humble, and, embracing them, besought \rHis peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint: \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 305 \r\r" Forsake me not thus, Adam ! witness Heaven \rWhat love sincere and reverence in my heart \rI bear thee, and unweeting have offended, \rUnhappily deceived ! Thy suppliant \rI beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, \r\'Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, \rThy counsel in this uttermost distress, 920 \r\rMy only strength and stay : forlorn of thee, \rWhither shall I betake me, where subsist? \r**While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps, \rBetween us two let there be peace ; both joining, \r\' As joined in injuries, one enmity \r\rAgainst a foe by doom express assigned us, \r\rThat cruel Serpent. On me exercise not \r\rThy hatred for this misery befallen; \r\rOn me already lost, me than thyself \r\rMore miserable. Both have sinned; but thou 930 \r\rAgainst God only; I against God and thee, \r\rAnd to the place of judgment will return, \r\rThere with my cries importune Heaven, that all \r\rThe sentence, from thy head removed, may light \r\rOn me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, \r\rMe, me only, just object of His ire." \r\rShe ended weeping; and her lowly plight, \rI Immovable till peace obtained from fault \r.! Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought \r*" Commiseration. Soon his heart relented 940 \r\rTowards her, his life so late and sole delight, \rNow at his feet submissive in distress, \rCreature so fair his reconcilement seeking, \rHis counsel, whom she had displeased, his aid; \rAs one disarmed, his anger all he lost, \rAnd thus with peaceful words upraised her soon : \r\r\r\rp. L. \r\r\r\r20 \r\r\r\r306 PARADISE LOST. \r\r" Unwary, and too desirous, as before \rSo now, of what thou know\'st not, who desir\'st \rThe punishment all on thyself! Alas! \rBear thine own first, ill able to sustain 950 \r\rHis full wrath, whose thou feel\'st as yet least part, \rAnd my displeasure bear\'st so ill. If prayers \rCould alter high decrees, I to that place \rWould speed before thee, and be louder heard, \rThat on my head all might be visited, \rThy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven, \rj To me committed, and by me exposed. \r" But rise ; let us no more contend, nor blame \rEach other, blamed enough elsewhere, but strive \rIn offices of love, how we may lighten 960 \r\rC-*. Each other\'s burden, in our share of woe; \r\rSince this day\'s death denounced, if aught I see, \rWill prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil, \rA long day\'s dying, to augment our pain, \r..A/id to our seed (O hapless seed !) derived." \r\rTo whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied: \r"Adam, by sad experiment I know \rHow little weight my words with thee can find, \r.Found so erroneous, thence by just event \rFound so unfortunate; nevertheless, 970 \r\rRestored by thee, vile as I am, to place \rOf new acceptance, hopeful to regain \rThy love, the sole contentment of my heart, \rLiving or dying from thee I will not hide \rWhat thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen, \rTending to some relief of our extremes, \rOr end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, \rAs in our evils, and of easier choice. \rIf care of our descent perplex us most, \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 307 \r\rWhich must be born to certain woe, devoured 980 \r\rBy Death at last (and miserable it is \rTo be to others cause of misery, \rOur own begotten, and of our loins to bring \rInto this cursed World a woeful race, \rThat after wretched life must be at last \rFood for so foul a monster), in thy power \rIt lies, yet ere conception, to prevent \rThe race unblest, to being yet unbegot. \rChildless thou art, childless remain; so Death \rShall be deceived his glut, and with us two 990 \r\rBe forced to satisfy his ravenous maw. \rBut if thou judge it hard and difficult, \rConversing, looking, loving, to abstain \rFrom love\'s due rites, nuptial embraces sweet, \rft^jAnd with desire to languish without hope, \rBefore the present object languishing \rWith like desire, which would be misery \r\ri And torment less than none of what we dread; \r\rL Then, both our selves and seed at once to free \rFrom what we fear for both, let us make short, 1000 \r\rLet us seek Death, or, he not found, supply \rWith our own hands his office on ourselves. \rWhy stand we longer shivering under fears \rThat show no end but death, and have the power, \rOf many ways to die the shortest choosing, \rDestruction with destruction to destroy?" \r\rShe ended here, or vehement despair \rBroke off the rest ; so much of death her thoughts \rHad entertained as dyed her cheeks with pale. \rBut Adam, with such counsel nothing swayed, 1010 \r\rTo better hopes his more attentive mind \rLabouring had raised, and thus to Eve replied: \r\r20 2 \r\r\r\r308 PARADISE LOST. \r\r"Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems \rTo argue in thee something more sublime \rAnd excellent than what thy mind contemns; \rBut self-destruction therefore sought refutes \rThat excellence thought in thee, and implies, \rNot thy contempt, but anguish and regret \rFor loss of life and pleasure overloved. \rOr if thou covet death, as utmost end 1020 \r\rOf misery, so thinking to evade \rThe penalty pronounced, doubt not but God \rHath wiselier armed his vengeful ire than so \rTo be forestalled ; much more I fear lest death \rSo snatched will not exempt us from the pain \rWe are by doom to pay; rather such acts \rOf contumacy will provoke the Highest \rTo make death in us live. Then let us seek \rSome safer resolution, which methinks \rI have in view, calling to mind with heed 1030 \r\rPart of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise \rThe Serpent\'s head : piteous amends ! unless \rBe meant, whom I conjecture, our grand foe, \rSatan, who in the serpent hath contrived \rAgainst us this deceit. To crush his head \rWould be revenge indeed; which will be lost \rBy death brought on ourselves, or childless days \rResolved as thou proposest; so our foe \rShall scape his punishment ordained, and we \rInstead shall double ours upon our heads. 1040 \r\rNo more be mentioned then of violence \rAgainst ourselves, and wilful barrenness, \rThat cuts us off from hope, and savours only \rRancour and pride, impatience and despite, \rReluctance against God and his just yoke \r\r\r\rBOOK X. 309 \r\rLaid on our necks. Remember with what mild \r\rAnd gracious temper he both heard and judged, \r\rWithout wrath or reviling; we expected \r\rImmediate dissolution, which we thought \r\rWas meant by death that day; when, lo ! to thee 1050 \r\rPains only in child-bearing were foretold, \r\rAnd bringing forth, soon recompensed with joy, \r\rFruit of thy womb ; on me the curse aslope \r\rGlanced on the ground : with iirtrurrr^im^ -earn \r\rMy bread; what harm? Idleness- had- been worse ; \r\rMy_Jabour will sustain ni; nnH r J4*sfc-f*4d \r\rQrjigat should injure us, his timely care \r\rHath, unbejsojight, -proJ4ed y -^and- his^ hands \r\rClothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged ; \r\rHow much more, if we pray frirn^ will hi? ^ar 1060 \r\r\r\rBe open, and his heart to pity incline, \rjVnd. teach us further "by whaT means to shim \rThe inr1pTT|frnfTeasons, ram, ice, hail, and snow! \rWhich now the sky with various face begms \rTo show us in this mountain, whife^trTe^winds \rBlow moist and keen," shattering the graceful locks \rOf these fair spreading trees ; which bids us seek \rSome better shroud, some better warmth to cherish \rOur limbs benumbed, ere this diurnal star \rLeave cold the night, how we his gathered beams 1070 \rReflected may with matter sere foment, \rOr by collision of two bodies grind \rThe air attrite to fire; as late the clouds, \rJustling or pushed with winds, rude in their shock, \rTine the slant lightning, whose thwart flame driven down \rKindles the gummy bark of fir or pine, \rAnd sends a comfortable heat from far, \rWhich might supply the sun. Such fire to use, \r\r\r\r310 PARADISE LOST. \r\rAnd what may else be remedy or cure \r\rTo evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, 1080 \r\rHe will instruct us praying, and of grace \r\rBeseeching him; so as we need not fear \r\rTo pass commodiously this life, sustained \r\rBy him with many comforts, till we end \r\rIn dust, our final rest and native home. \r\rWhat better can we do, than, to the place \r\rRepairing where he judged us, prostrate fall \r\rBefore him reverent, and there confess \r\rHumbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears \r\rWatering the ground, and with our sighs the air 1090 \r\rFrequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign \r\rOf sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek? \r\rUndoubtedly he will relent, and turn \r\rFrom his displeasure; in whose look serene, \r\rWhen angry most he seemed and most severe, \r\rWhat else but favour, grace, and mercy shone ? " \r\rSo spake our father penitent; nor Eve \rFelt less remorse. They, forthwith to the place \rRepairing where he judged them, prostrate fell \rBefore him reverent, and both confessed noo \r\rHumbly their faults, and pardon begged, with tears \rWatering the ground, and with their sighs the air \rFrequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign \rOf sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek. \r\r\r\rBOOK XI. \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\rThe Son of God presents to his Father the prayers of our first \rparents now repenting, and intercedes for them. God accepts them, \rbut declares that they must no longer abide in Paradise ; sends Michael \rwith a band of Cherubim to dispossess them, but first to reveal to Adam \rfuture things : Michael\'s coming down. Adam shows to Eve certain \rominous signs ; he discerns Michael\'s approach > goes out to meet him : \rthe Angel denounces their departure. Eve\'s lamentation. Adam pleads, \rbut submits : the Angel leads him up to a high hill ; sets before him in \rvision what shall happen till the Flood. \r\r\r\r\r\r\rBOOK XL \r\r\r\rTHUS they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood \rPraying; for from the mercy-seat above \rPrevenient grace descending had removed \rThe stony from their hearts, and made new flesh \rRegenerate grow instead, that sighs now breathed \rUnutterable, which the Spirit of prayer \rInspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight \rThan loudest oratory. Yet their port \rNot of mean suitors, nor important less \rSeemed their petition than when the ancient pair 10 \r\rIn fables old, less ancient yet than these, \rDeucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore \rThe race of mankind drowned, before the shrine \rOf Themis stood devout. To Heaven their prayers \rFlew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds \rBlown vagabond or frustrate : in they passed \rDimensionless through heavenly doors; then, clad \rWith incense, where the golden altar fumed, \rBy their great Intercessor, came in sight \rBefore the Father\'s throne. Them the glad Son 20 \r\rPresenting thus to intercede began : \r\r"See, Father, what first-fruits on Earth are sprung \r\r\r\r314 PARADISE LOST. \r\rFrom thy implanted grace in Man these sighs \r\rAnd prayers, which in this golden censer, mixed \r\rWith incense, I, thy priest, before thee bring; \r\rFruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed \r\rSown with contrition in his heart, than those \r\rWhich, his own hand manuring, all the trees \r\rOf Paradise could have produced, ere fallen \r\rFrom innocence. Now, therefore, bend thine ear 30 \r\rTo supplication; hear his sighs, though mute: \r\rUnskilful with what words to pray, let me \r\rInterpret for him, me his advocate \r\rAnd propitiation; all his works on me, \r\rGood or not good, ingraft; my merit those \r\rShall perfect, and for these my death shall pay. \r\rAccept me, and in me from these receive \r\rThe smell of peace toward Mankind : let him live \r\rBefore thee reconciled, at least his days \r\rNumbered, though sad ; till death, his doom (which I 40 \r\rTo mitigate thus plead, not to reverse), \r\rTo better life shall yield him, where with me \r\rAll my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss, \r\rMade one with me, as I with thee am one." \r\rTo whom the Father, without cloud, serene: \r"All thy request for Man, accepted Son, \rObtain; all thy request was my decree. \rBut longer in that Paradise to dwell \rThe law I gave to Nature him forbids; \rThose pure immortal elements, that know 50 \r\rNo gross, no unharmonious mixture foul, \rEject him, tainted now, and purge him off, \rAs a distemper, gross, to air as gross, \rAnd mortal food, as may dispose him best \rFor dissolution wrought by sin, that first \r\r\r\rBOOK XL 315 \r\rDistempered all things, and of incorrupt \r\rCorrupted. I, at first, with two fair gifts \r\rCreated him endowed with happiness \r\rAnd immortality ; that fondly lost, \r\rThis other served but to eternize woe, 60 \r\rTill I provided death : so death becomes \r\rHis final remedy, and, after life \r\rTried in sharp tribulation, and refined \r\rBy faith and faithful works, to second life, \r\rWaked in the renovation of the just, \r\rResigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed. \r\rBut let us call to Synod all the Blest \r\rThrough Heaven\'s wide bounds ; from them I will not hide \r\rMy judgments, how with Mankind I proceed, \r\rAs how with peccant Angels late they saw, 70 \r\rAnd in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed." \r\rHe ended, and the Son gave signal high \rTo the bright minister that watched. He blew \rHis trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps \rWhen God descended, and perhaps once more \rTo sound at general doom. The angelic blast \rFilled all the regions : from their blissful bowers \rOf amarantine shade, fountain or spring, \rBy the waters of life, where\'er they sat \rIn fellowships of joy, the Sons of Light 80 \r\rHasted, resorting to the summons high, \rAnd took their seats, till from his throne supreme \rThe Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will : \r\r"O Sons, like one of us Man is become \rTo know both good and evil, since his taste \rOf that defended fruit; but let him boast \rHis knowledge of good lost and evil got, \rHappier had it sufficed him to have known \r\r\r\r316 PARADISE LOST. \r\rGood by itself, and evil not at all. \r\rHe sorrows now, repents, and prays contrite 90 \r\rMy motions in him ; longer than they move, \r\rHis heart I know how variable and vain, \r\rSelf-left. Lest, therefore, his now bolder hand \r\rReach also of the Tree of Life, and eat, \r\rAnd live for ever dream at least to live \r\rFor ever to remove him I decree, \r\rAnd send him from the garden forth, to till \r\rThe ground whence he was taken, fitter soil. \r\rMichael, this my behest have thou in charge : \r\rTake to thee from among the Cherubim 100 \r\rThy choice of flaming warriors, lest the Fiend, \r\rOr in behalf of Man, or to invade \r\rVacant possession, some new trouble raise; \r\rHaste thee, and from the Paradise of God \r\rWithout remorse drive out the sinful pair, \r\rFrom hallowed ground the unholy, and denounce \r\rTo them, and to their progeny, from thence \r\rPerpetual banishment. Yet, lest they faint \r\rAt the sad sentence rigorously .urged \r\r(For I behold them softened, and with tears no \r\rBewailing their excess), all terror hide. \r\rIf patiently thy bidding they obey, \r\rDismiss them not disconsolate; reveal \r\rTo Adam what shall come in future days, \r\rAs I shall thee enlighten; intermix \r\rMy covenant in the Woman\'s seed renewed. \r\rSo send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace; \r\rAnd on the east side of the garden place, \r\rWhere entrance up from Eden easiest climbs, \r\rCherubic watch, and of a sword the flame 120 \r\rWide-waving, all approach far off to fright, \r\r\r\rBOOK XI. 317 \r\rAnd guard all passage to the Tree of Life; \r\rLest Paradise a receptacle prove \r\rTo Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey, \r\rWith whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude." \r\rHe ceased, and the archangelic Power prepared \rFor swift descent; with him the cohort bright \rOf watchful Cherubim. Four faces each \rHad, like a double Janus; all their shape \rSpangled with eyes more numerous than those 130 \r\rOf Argus, and more wakeful than to drowse, \rCharmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed \rOf Hermes, or his opiate rod. Meanwhile, \rTo resalute the world with sacred light, \rLeucothea waked, and with fresh dews embalmed \rThe Earth; when Adam and first matron Eve \rHad ended now their orisons, and found \rStrength added from above; new hope to spring \rOut of despair ; joy, but with fear yet linked ; \rWhich thus to Eve his welcome words renewed : 140 \r\r"Eve, easily may faith admit that all \rThe good which we enjoy from Heaven descends ; \rBut that from us aught should ascend to Heaven \rSo prevalent as to concern the mind \rOf God high-blest, or to incline his will, \rHard to belief may seem ; yet this will prayer, \rOr one short sigh of human breath, upborne \rEven to the seat of God. For, since I sought \rBy prayer the offended Deity to appease, \rKneeled and before him humbled all my heart, 150 \r\rMethought I saw him placable and mild, \rBending his ear; persuasion in me grew \rThat I was heard with favour ; peace returned \rHome to my breast, and to my memory \r\r\r\r3l8 PARADISE LOST. \r\rHis promise that thy seed shall bruise our Foe; \r\rWhich, then not minded in dismay, yet now \r\rAssures me that the bitterness of death \r\rIs past, and we shall live. Whence hail to thee! \r\rEve rightly called, Mother of all Mankind, \r\rMother of all things living, since by thee 160 \r\rMan is to live, and all things live for Man." \r\rTo whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek: \r" Ill-worthy I such title should belong \rTo me transgressor, who, for thee ordained \rA help, became thy snare; to me reproach \rRather belongs, distrust and all dispraise. \rBut infinite in pardon was my Judge, \rThat I, who first brought death on all, am graced \rThe source of life; next favourable thou, \rWho highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf\'st, 170 \r\rFar other name deserving. But the field \rTo labour calls us, now with sweat imposed, \rThough after sleepless night ; for see ! the Morn, \rAll unconcerned with our unrest, begins \rHer rosy progress smiling. Let us forth, \rI never from thy side henceforth to stray, \rWhere\'er our day\'s work lies, though now enjoined \rLaborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, \rWhat can be toilsome in these pleasant walks? \rHere let us live, though in fallen state, content." 180 \r\rSo spake, so wished, much-humbled Eve; but Fate \rSubscribed not. Nature first gave signs, impressed \rOn bird, beast, air air suddenly eclipsed, \rAfter short blush of morn. Nigh in her sight \rThe bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour, \rTwo birds of gayest plume before him drove; \rDown from a hill the beast that reigns in woods, \r\r\r\rBOOK XI. 319 \r\rFirst hunter then, pursued a gentle brace, \r\rGoodliest of all the forest, hart and hind ; \r\rDirect to the eastern gate was bent their flight. 190 \r\rAdam observed, and, with his eye the chase \r\rPursuing, not unmoved to Eve thus spake : \r\r"O Eve, some further change awaits us nigh, \rWhich Heaven by these mute signs in Nature shows, \rForerunners of his purpose, or to warn \rUs, haply too secure of our discharge \rFrom penalty because from death released \rSome days; how long, and what till then our life, \rWho knows? or more than this, that we are dust, \rAnd thither must return, and be no more? 200 \r\rWhy else this double object in our sight, \rOf flight pursued in the air and o\'er the ground \rOne way the self-same hour? Why in the east \rDarkness ere day\'s mid-course, and morning-light \rMore orient in yon western cloud, that draws \rO\'er the blue firmament a radiant white, \rAnd slow descends, with something Heavenly fraught?" \r\rHe erred not; for, by this, the Heavenly bands \rDown from a sky of jasper lighted now \rIn Paradise, and on a hill made halt; 210 \r\rA glorious apparition, had not doubt \rAnd carnal fear that day dimmed Adam\'s eye. \rNot that more glorious, when the Angels met \rJacob in Mahanaim, where he saw \rThe field pavilioned with his guardians bright; \rNor that which on the flaming mount appeared \rIn Dothan, covered with a camp of fire, \rAgainst the Syrian king, who to surprise \rOne man, assassin-like, had levied war, \rWar unproclaimed. The princely Hierarch \' 220 \r\r\r\r320 PARADISE LOoT. \r\rIn their bright stand there left his Powers to seize \r\rPossession of the garden; he alone, \r\rTo find where Adam sheltered, took his way, \r\rNot unperceived of Adam ; who to Eve, \r\rWhile the great visitant approached, thus spake: \r\r"Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps \rOf us will soon determine, or impose \rNew laws to be observed; for I descry, \rFrom yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill, \rOne of the Heavenly host, and, by his gait, 230 \r\rNone of the meanest some great Potentate \rOr of the Thrones above, such majesty \rInvests him coming; yet not terrible, \rThat I should fear, nor sociably mild, \rAs Raphael, that I should much confide; \rBut solemn and sublime; whom, not to offend, \rWith reverence I must meet, and thou retire." \r\rHe ended; and the Archangel soon drew nigh, \rNot in his shape celestial, but as man \rClad to meet man. Over his lucid arms 240 \r\rA military vest of purple flowed, \rLivelier than Meliboean, or the grain \rOf Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old \rIn time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof. \rHis starry helm unbuckled showed him prime \rIn manhood where youth ended; by his side, \rAs in a glistering zodiac, hung the sword, \rSatan\'s dire dread, and in his hand the spear. \rAdam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state \rInclined not, but his coming thus declared : 250 \r\r" Adam, Heaven\'s high behest no preface needs : \rSufficient that thy prayers are heard, and Death, \rThen due by sentence when thou didst transgress, \r\r\r\rBOOK XI. 321 \r\rDefeated of his seizure many days, \r\rGiven thee of grace, wherein thou may\'st repent, \r\rAnd one bad act with many deeds well done \r\rMay\'st cover. Well may then thy Lord, appeased, \r\rRedeem thee quite from Death\'s rapacious claim; \r\rBut longer in this Paradise to dwell \r\rPermits not: to remove thee I am come, 260 \r\rAnd send thee from the garden forth, to till \r\rThe ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil." \r\rHe added not; for Adam at the news \rHeart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, \rThat all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen \rYet all had heard, with audible lament \rDiscovered soon the place of her retire : \r\r" O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death ! \rMust I thus leave thee, Paradise? thus leave \rThee, native soil? these happy walks and shades, 270 \rFit haunt of Gods ? where I had hope to spend, \rQuiet, though sad, the respite of that day \rThat must be mortal to us both. O flowers, \rThat never will in other climate grow, \rMy early visitation, and my last \rAt even, which I bred up with tender hand \rFrom the first opening bud, and gave ye names, \rWho now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank \rYour tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount? \rThee, lastly, nuptial bower, by me adorned 280 \r\rWith what to sight or smell was sweet, from thee \rHow shall I part, and whither wander down \rInto a lower world, to this obscure \rAnd wild? How shall we breathe in other air \rLess pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?" \r\rWhom thus the Angel interrupted mild: \r\rP. L. 21 \r\r\r\r322 PARADISE LOST. \r\rk< Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign \r\rWhat justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, \r\rThus over-fond, on that which is not thine. \r\rThy going is not lonely ; with thee goes 290 \r\rThy husband; him to follow thou art bound; \r\rWhere he abides, think there thy native soil." \r\rAdam, by this from the cold sudden damp \rRecovering, and his scattered spirits returned, \rTo Michael thus his humble words addressed : \r\r" Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named \rOf them the highest for such of shape may seem \rPrince above princes gently hast thou told \rThy message, which might else in telling wound, \rAnd in performing end us. What besides 300 \r\rOf sorrow, and dejection, and despair, \rOur frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring; \rDeparture from this happy place, our sweet \rRecess, and only consolation left \rFamiliar to our eyes ; all places else \rInhospitable appear, and desolate, \rNor knowing us, nor known. And, if by prayer \rIncessant I could hope to change the will \rOf him who all things can, I would not cease \rTo weary him with my assiduous cries; 310 \r\rBut prayer against his absolute decree \rNo more avails than breath against the wind, \rBlown stifling back on him that breathes it forth: \rTherefore to his great bidding I submit. \rThis most afflicts me, that, departing hence, \rAs from his face I shall be hid, deprived \rHis blessed countenance. Here I could frequent, \rWith worship, place by place where he vouchsafed \rPresence Divine, and to my sons relate, \r\r\r\rBOOK XI. 323 \r\r\' On this mount he appeared ; under this tree 320 \r\rStood visible ; among these pines his voice \r\rI heard; here with him at this fountain talked.\' \r\rSo many grateful altars I would rear \r\rOf grassy turf, and pile up every stone \r\rOf lustre from the brook, in memory \r\rOr monument to ages, and thereon \r\rOffer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers. \r\rIn yonder nether world where shall I seek \r\rHis bright appearances, or footstep trace? \r\rFor, though I fled him angry, yet, recalled 330 \r\rTo life prolonged and promised race, I now \r\rGladly behold though but his utmost skirts \r\rOf glory, and far off his steps adore." \r\rTo whom thus Michael, with regard benign : \r"Adam, thou know\'st Heaven his, and all the Earth, \rNot this rock only ; his omnipresence fills \rLand, sea, and air, and every kind that lives, \rFomented by his virtual power and warmed. \rAll the Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, \rNo despicable gift; surmise not, then, 340 \r\rHis presence to these narrow bounds confined \rOf Paradise or Eden. This had been \rPerhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread \rAll generations, and had hither come \rFrom all the ends of the Earth, to celebrate \rAnd reverence thee their great progenitor. \rBut this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down \rTo dwell on even ground now with thy sons. \rYet doubt not but in valley and in plain \rGod is, as here, and will be found alike 350 \r\rPresent, and of his presence many a sign, \rStill following thee, still compassing thee round \r\r21 2 \r\r\r\r324 PARADISE LOST. \r\rWith goodness and paternal love, his face \r\rExpress, and of his steps the track divine. \r\rWhich that thou may\'st believe, and be confirmed, \r\rEre thou from hence depart, know I am sent \r\rTo show thee what shall come in future days \r\rTo thee and to thy offspring. Good with bad \r\rExpect to hear, supernal grace contending \r\rWith sinfulness of men; thereby to learn 360 \r\rTrue patience, and to temper joy with fear \r\rAnd pious sorrow, equally inured \r\rBy moderation either state to bear, \r\rProsperous or adverse : so shalt thou lead \r\rSafest thy life, and best prepared endure \r\rThy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend \r\rThis hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes) \r\rHere sleep below while thou to foresight wak\'st, \r\rAs once thou slept\'st, while she to life was formed." \r\r/ To whom thus Adam gratefully replied: 370 \r\r"Ascend; I follow thee, safe guide, the path \rThou lead\'st me, and to the hand of Heaven submit, \rHowever chastening; to the evil turn \rMy obvious breast, arming to overcome \rBy suffering, and earn rest from labour won, \rIf so I may attain." So both ascend \r\rs In the visions of God. It was a hill, \r\rOf Paradise the highest, from whose top \r\r! The hemisphere of Earth, in clearest ken, \rStretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay. 380 \r\r\' Not higher that hill, nor wider looking round, \r\ri Whereon for different cause the Tempter set \rOur second Adam, in the wilderness, \r\r: To show him all Earth\'s kingdoms and their glory. \r\rj His eye might there command wherever stood \r\r\r\rBOOK XL 325 \r\rCity of old or modern fame, the seat \r\rOf mightiest empire, from the destined walls \r\rOf Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can, \r\rAnd Samarchand by Oxus, Temir\'s throne, \r\rTo Paquin of Sinaean kings, and thence 390 \r\rTo Agra and Lahor of Great Mogul, \r\rDown to the golden Chersonese, or where \r\rThe Persian in Ecbatan sat, or since \r\rIn Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar \r\rIn Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, \r\rTurchestan-born ; nor could his eye not ken \r\rThe empire of Negus to his utmost port \r\rErcoco, and the less maritime kings, \r\rMombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, \r\rAnd Sofala, thought Ophir, to the realm 400 \r\rOf Congo, and Angola farthest south ; \r\rOr thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount, \r\rThe kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus, \r\rMarocco, and Algiers, and Tremisen ; \r\rOn Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway \r\rThe world. In spirit perhaps he also saw \r\rRich Mexico, the seat of Montezume, \r\rAnd Cusco in Peru, the richer seat \r\rOf Atabalipa, and yet unspoiled \r\rGuiana, whose great city Geryon\'s sons 410 \r\rCall El Dorado. But to nobler sights \r\rMichael from Adam\'s eyes the film removed \r\rWhich that false fruit that promised clearer sight \r\rHad bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue \r\rThe visual nerve, for he had much to see, \r\rAnd from the well of life three drops instilled. \r\rSo deep the power of these ingredients pierced, \r\rEven to the inmost seat of mental sight, \r\r\r\r326 PARADISE LOST. \r\rThat Adam, now enforced to close his eyes, \r\rSunk down, and all his spirits became entranced ; 420 \r\rBut him the gentle Angel by the hand \r\rSoon raised, and his attention thus recalled : \r\r"Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold \rThe effects which thy original crime hath wrought \rIn some to spring from thee, who never touched \rThe excepted tree, nor with the Snake conspired, \rNor sinned thy sin, yet from that sin derive \rCorruption to bring forth more violent deeds." \r\rHis eyes he opened, and beheld a field, \rPart arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves 450 \r\rNew-reaped, the other part sheep-walks and folds; \rI\' the midst an altar as the landmark stood, \rRustic, of grassy sord. Thither anon \rA sweaty reaper from his tillage brought \rFirst-fruits, the green ear and the yellow sheaf, \rUnculled, as came to hand; a shepherd next, \rMore meek, came with the firstlings of his flock, \rChoicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid \rThe inwards and their fat, with incense strewed, \rOn the cleft wood, and all due rites performed. 440 \r\rHis offering soon propitious fire from heaven \rConsumed with nimble glance and grateful steam; \rThe other\'s not, for his was not sincere : \rWhereat he inly raged, and, as they talked, \rSmote him into the midriff with a stone \rThat beat out life; he fell, and, deadly pale, \rGroaned out his soul with gushing blood effused. \rMuch at that sight was Adam in his heart \rDismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried : \r\r"O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen 450 \rTo that meek man, who well had sacrificed : \r\r\r\rBOOK XI. 327 \r\rIs piety thus and pure devotion paid?" \r\rTo whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied : \r"These two are brethren, Adam, and to come \rOut of thy loins. The unjust the just hath slain, \rFor envy that his brother\'s offering found \rFrom Heaven acceptance; but the bloody fact \rWill be avenged, and the other\'s faith approved \rLose no reward, though here thou see him die, \rRolling in dust and gore." To which our Sire: 460 \r\r" Alas, both for the deed and for the cause ! \rBut have I now seen Death? Is this the way \rI must return to native dust? O sight \rOf terror, foul and ugly to behold ! \rHorrid to think, how horrible to feel ! " \r\rTo whom thus Michael : " Death thou hast seen \rIn his first shape on Man; but many shapes \rOf Death, and many are the ways that lead \rTo his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense \rMore terrible at the entrance than within. 470 \r\rSome, as thou saw\'st, by violent stroke shall die, \rBy fire, flood, famine ; by intemperance more \rIn meats and drinks, which on the Earth shall bring \rDiseases dire, of which a monstrous crew \rBefore thee shall appear, that thou may\'st know \rWhat misery the inabstinence of Eve \rShall bring on men." Immediately a place \rBefore his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark ; \rA lazar-house it seemed, wherein were laid \rNumbers of all diseased, all maladies 480 \r\rOf ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms \rOf heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds, \rConvulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs, \rIntestine stone and ulcer, colic pangs, \r\r\r\r328 PARADISE LOST. \r\rDemoniac phrenzy, moping melancholy, \r\rAnd moon-struck madness, pining atrophy, \r\rMarasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence, \r\rDropsies and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums. \r\rDire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair \r\rTended the sick, busiest from couch to couch; 490 \r\rAnd over them triumphant Death his dart \r\rShook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked \r\rWith vows, as their chief good and final hope. \r\rSight so deform what heart of rock could long \r\rDry-eyed behold? Adam could not, but wept, \r\rThough not of woman born : compassion quelled \r\rHis best of man, and gave him up to tears \r\rA space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess, \r\rAnd, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed : \r\r"O miserable Mankind, to what fall 500 \r\rDegraded, to what wretched state reserved ! \rBetter end here unborn. Why is life given \rTo be thus wrested from us? rather why \rObtruded on us thus? who, if we knew \rWhat we receive, would either not accept \rLife offered, or soon beg to lay it down, \rGlad to be so dismissed in peace. Can thus \rThe image of God in Man, created once \rSo goodly and erect, though faulty since, \rTo such unsightly sufferings be debased 510 \r\rUnder inhuman pains? Why should not Man, \rRetaining still divine similitude \rIn part, from such deformities be free, \rAnd for his Maker\'s image sake exempt?" \r\r"Their Maker\'s image," answered Michael, "then \rForsook them, when themselves they vilified \rTo serve ungoverned Appetite, and took \r\r\r\rBOOK XI. 329 \r\rHis image whom they served a brutish vice, \rInductive mainly to the sin of Eve. \r\rTherefore so abject is their punishment, 520 \r\rDisfiguring not God\'s likeness, but their own; \rOr, if his likeness, by themselves defaced \rWhile they pervert pure Nature\'s healthful rules \rTo loathsome sickness; worthily, since they \rGod\'s image did not reverence in themselves." \r"I yield it just," said Adam, "and submit. \rBut is there yet no other way, besides \rThese painful passages, how we may come \rTo death, and mix with our connatural dust?" \r\r"There is," said Michael, "if thou well observe 530 \rThe rule of^Not too muchly temperance taught \rIn what thou eat ; st and dnnJt\'st, seeking from thence \rDue nourishment, not gluttpnou^TcTelight, \rTill many years over thy head return. \r\ro may\'st thou live, till, like ripe fruit, thou drop \r\rnto thy mother\'s lap, or be with ease \r\rathered, not harshly plucked, for death mature. \r\rhis is old age; but then thou must outlive \r\ryouth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change \r\r\'o withered, weak, and grey; thy senses then, 540 \r\rbtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgo \rwhat thou hast; and, for the air of youth, \r\rhopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign \rmelancholy damp of cold and dry, \r\r"o weigh thy spirits down, and last consume \r\r\'he balm of life." To whom our Ancestor : \r\r"Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong \rLife much, bent rather how I may be quit, \rFairest and easiest, of this cumbrous charge, \rWhich I must keep till my appointed day 550 \r\r\r\r33O PARADISE LOST. \r\rOf rendering up, and patiently attend \rMy dissolution." Michael replied : \r\r"Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest \rLive well; how long or short, permit to Heaven. \rAnd now prepare thee for another sight." \r\rHe looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon \rWere tents of various hue ; by some were herds \rOf cattle grazing ; others, whence the sound \rOf instruments that made melodious chime \rWas heard, of harp and organ, and who moved 560 \r\rTheir stops and chords was seen ; his volant touch \rInstinct through all proportions, low and high, \rFled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue. \rIn other part stood one who, at the forge \rLabouring, two massy clods of iron and brass \rHad melted (whether found where casual fire \rHad wasted woods, on mountain or in vale, \rDown to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot \rTo some cave\'s mouth, or whether washed by stream \rFrom underground) ; the liquid ore he drained 570 \r\rInto fit moulds prepared; from which he formed \rFirst his own tools; then, what might else be wrought \rFusil or graven in metal. After these, \rBut on the hither side, a different sort \rFrom the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat, \rDown to the plain descended : by their guise \rJust men they seemed, and all their study bent \rTo worship God aright, and know his works \rNot hid; nor those things last which might preserve \rFreedom and peace to men. They on the plain 580 \rLong had not walked, when from the tents behold \rA bevy of fair women, richly gay \rIn gems and wanton dress ! to the harp they sung \r\r\r\rBOOK XI. 331 \r\rSoft amorous ditties, and in dance came on. \r\rThe men, though grave, eyed them, and let their eyes \r\rRove without rein, till, in the amorous net \r\rFast caught, they liked, and each his liking chose. \r\rAnd now of love they treat, till the evening-star, \r\rLove\'s harbinger, appeared ; then, all in heat, \r\rThey light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke 590 \r\rHymen, then first to marriage rites invoked : \r\rWith feast and music all the tents resound. \r\rSuch happy interview, and fair event \r\rOf love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers, \r\rAnd charming symphonies, attached the heart \r\rOf Adam, soon inclined to admit delight, \r\rThe bent of Nature ; which he thus expressed : \r\r"True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, \rMuch better seems this vision, and more hope \rOf peaceful days portends, than those two past : 600 \r\rThose were of hate and death, or pain much worse; \rHere Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends." \r\rTo whom thus Michael : " Judge not what is best \rBy pleasure, though to. Nature seeming meet, \rCreated, as thou art, to nobler end, \rHoly and pure, conformity divine. \rThose tents thou saw\'st so pleasant were the tents \rOf wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race \rWho slew his brother: studious they appear \rOf arts that polish life, inventors rare; 610 \r\rUnmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit \rTaught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none. \rYet they a beauteous offspring shall beget; \rFor that fair female troop thou saw\'st, that seemed \rOf goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, \rYet empty of all good wherein consists \r\r\r\r332 PARADISE LOST. \r\rWoman\'s domestic honour and chief praise; \r\rBred only and completed to the taste \r\rOf lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, \r\rTo dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye ; 620 \r\rTo these that sober race of men, whose lives \r\rReligious titled them the Sons of God, \r\rShall yield up all their virtue, all their fame, \r\rIgnobly, to the trains and to the smiles \r\rOf these fair atheists, and now swim in joy \r\r(Erelong to swim at large) and laugh ; for which \r\rThe world erelong a world of tears must weep." \r\rTo whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft : \r"O pity and shame, that they who to live well \rEntered so fair should turn aside to tread 630 \r\rPaths indirect, or in the midway faint ! \rBut still I see the tenor of Man\'s woe \rHolds on the same, from Woman to begin." \r\r"From Man\'s effeminate slackness it begins," \rSaid the Angel, "who should better hold his place \rBy wisdom, and superior gifts received. \rBut now prepare thee for another scene." \r\rHe looked, and saw wide territory spread \rBefore him towns, and rural works between, \rCities of men with lofty gates and towers, 640 \r\rConcourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war, \rGiants of mighty bone and bold emprise ; \rPart wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed, \rSingle or in array of battle ranged, \rBoth horse and foot, nor idly mustering stood. \rOne way a band select from forage drives \rA herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine, \rFrom a fat meadow-ground, or fleecy flock, \rEwes and their bleating lambs, over the plain, \r\r\r\rBOOK XL 333 \r\rTheir booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly, 650 \r\rBut call in aid, which makes a bloody fray : \r\rWith cruel tournament the squadrons join; \r\rWhere cattle pastured late, now scattered lies \r\rWith carcasses and arms the ensanguined field \r\rDeserted. Others to a city strong \r\rLay siege, encamped, by battery, scale, and mine, \r\rAssaulting; others from the wall defend \r\rWith dart and javelin, stones and sulphurous fire ; \r\rOn each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. \r\rIn other part the sceptred haralds call 660 \r\rTo council in the city-gates : anon \r\rGrey-headed men and grave, with warriors mixed, \r\rAssemble, and harangues are heard; but soon \r\rIn factious opposition, till at last \r\rOf middle age one rising, eminent \r\rIn wise deport, spake much of right and wrong, \r\rOf justice, of religion, truth, and peace, \r\rAnd judgment from above : him old and young \r\rExploded, and had seized with violent hands, \r\rHad not a cloud descending snatched him thence, 670 \r\rUnseen amid the throng. So violence \r\rProceeded, and oppression, and sword-law, \r\rThrough all the plain, and refuge none was found. \r\rAdam was all in tears, and to his guide \r\rLamenting turned full sad: "Oh, what are these? \r\rDeath\'s ministers, not men ! who thus deal death \r\rInhumanly to men, and multiply \r\rTen thousandfold the sin of him who slew \r\rHis brother; for of whom such massacre \r\rMake they but of their brethren, men of men? 680 \r\rBut who was that just man, whom had not Heaven \r\rRescued, had in his righteousness been lost?" \r\r\r\r334 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTo whom thus Michael : " These are the product \rOf those ill-mated marriages thou saw\'st; \rWhere good with bad were matched, who of themselves \rAbhor to join, and, by imprudence mixed, \rProduce prodigious births of body or mind. \rSuch were these Giants, men of high renown ; \rFor in those days might only shall be admired, \rAnd valour and heroic virtue called ; 690 \r\rTo overcome in battle, and subdue \rNations, and bring home spoils with infinite \rMan-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch \rOf human glory, and for glory done \rOf triumph, to be styled great conquerors, \rPatrons of mankind, gods, and sons of gods \rDestroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men. \rThus fame shall be achieved, renown on Earth, \rAnd what most merits fame in silence hid. \rBut he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheld\'st 700 \rThe only righteous in a world perverse, \rAnd therefore hated, therefore so beset \rWith foes, for daring single to be just, \rAnd utter odious truth, that God would come \rTo judge them with his Saints him the Most High, \rRapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds, \rDid, as thou saw\'st, receive, to walk with God \rHigh in salvation and the climes of bliss, \rExempt from death : to show thee what reward \rAwaits the good, the rest what punishment; 710 \r\rWhich now direct thine eyes and soon behold." \r\rHe looked, and saw the face of things quite changed; \rThe brazen throat of war had ceased to roar; \rAll now was turned to jollity and game, \rTo luxury and riot, feast and dance, \r\r\r\r\r\r\rBOOK XI. \r\rMarrying or prostituting, as befell, \r\rRape or adultery, where passing fair \r\rAllured them; thence from cups to civil broils. \r\rAt length a reverend sire among them came, \r\rAnd of their doings great dislike declared, 720 \r\rAnd testified against their ways : he oft \r\rFrequented their assemblies, whereso met, \r\rTriumphs or festivals, and to them preached \r\rConversion and repentance, as to souls \r\rIn prison, under judgments imminent; \r\rBut all in vain. Which when he saw, he ceased \r\rContending, and removed his tents far off; \r\rThen, from the mountain hewing timber tall, \r\rBegan to build a vessel of huge bulk, \r\rMeasured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth, 730 \r\rSmeared round with pitch, and in the side a door \r\rContrived, and of provisions laid in large \r\rFor man and beast : when lo ! a wonder strange ! \r\rOf every beast, and bird, and insect small, \r\rCame sevens and pairs, and entered in, as taught \r\rTheir order; last, the sire and his three sons, \r\rWith their four wives; and God made fast the door. \r\rMeanwhile the south-wind rose, and, with black wings \r\rWide hovering, all the clouds together drove \r\rFrom under heaven; the hills, to their supply, 740 \r\rVapour, and exhalation dusk and moist, \r\rSent up amain ; and now the thickened sky \r\rLike a dark ceiling stood : down rushed the rain \r\rImpetuous, and continued till the Earth \r\rNo more was seen. The floating vessel swum \r\rUplifted, and secure with beaked prow \r\rRode tilting o\'er the waves; all dwellings else \r\rFlood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp \r\r\r\r. PARADISE LOST. \r\r334 \r\r\r\runder water rolled; sea covered sea, \rSea without shore : and in their palaces, 750 \r\rWhere luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped \rAnd stabled : of mankind, so numerous late, \rAll left in one small bottom swum embarked. \rHow didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold \rThe end of all thy offspring, end so sad, \rDepopulation ! Thee another flood, \rOf tears and sorrow a flood, thee also drowned, \rAnd sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared \rBy the Angel, on thy feet thou stood\'st at last, \rThough comfortless, as when a father mourns 760 \r\rHis children, all in view destroyed at once; \rAnd scarce to the Angel utter\'dst thus thy plaint: \r\r" O visions ill foreseen ! Better had I \rLived ignorant of future ! so had borne \rMy part of evil only, each day\'s lot \rEnough to bear; those now, that were dispensed \rThe burden of many ages, on me light \rAt once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth \rAbortive, to torment me, ere their being, \rWith thought that they must be. Let no man seek 770 \rHenceforth to be foretold what shall befall \rHim or his children; evil he may be sure, \rWhich neither his foreknowing can prevent, \rAnd he the future evil shall no less \rIn apprehension than in substance feel \rGrievous to bear. But that care now is past; \rMan is not whom to warn; those few escaped \rFamine and anguish will at last consume, \rWandering that watery desert. I had hope, \rWhen violence was ceased and war on Earth, 780 \r\rAll would have then gone well, peace would have crowned \r\r\r\rBOOK XL 337 \r\rWith length of happy days the race of Man ; \rBut I was far deceived, for now I see \rPeace to corrupt no less than war to waste. \rHow comes it thus? Unfold, Celestial Guide, \rAnd whether here the race of Man will end." \r\rTo whom thus Michael : " Those, whom last thou saw\'st \rIn triumph and luxurious wealth, are they \rFirst seen in acts of prowess eminent \rAnd great exploits, but of true virtue void ; 790 \r\rWho, having spilt much blood, and done much waste, \rSubduing nations, and achieved thereby \rFame in the world, high titles, and rich prey, \rShall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, \rSurfeit, and lust, till wantonness and pride \rRaise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace. \rThe conquered also, and enslaved by war, \rShall, with their freedom lost, all virtue lose, \rAnd fear of God, from whom their piety feigned \rIn sharp contest of battle found no aid 800 \r\rAgainst invaders; therefore, cooled in zeal, \rThenceforth shall practise how to live secure, \rWorldly or dissolute, on what their lords \rShall leave them to enjoy; for the Earth shall bear \rMore than enough, that temperance may be tried. \rSo all shall turn degenerate, all depraved, \rJustice and temperance, truth and faith, forgot; \rOne man except, the only son of light \rIn a dark age, against example good, \rAgainst allurement, custom, and a world 810 \r\rOffended. Fearless of reproach and scorn, \rOr violence, he of their wicked ways \rShall them admonish, and before them set \rThe paths of righteousness, how much more safe \r\rp. L. 22 \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. \r\rAnd full of peace, denouncing wrath to come \r\rOn their impenitence ; and shall return \r\rOf them derided, but of God observed \r\rThe one just man alive ; by his command \r\rShall build a wondrous ark, as thou beheld\'st, \r\rTo save himself and household from amidst 820 \r\rA world devote to universal wrack. \r\rNo sooner he, with them of man and beast \r\rSelect for life, shall in the ark be lodged, \r\rAnd sheltered round, but all the cataracts \r\rOf Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour \r\rRain day and night; all fountains of the deep, \r\rBroke up, shall heave the ocean to usurp \r\rBeyond all bounds, till inundation rise \r\rAbove the highest hills. *Then shall this Mount \r\rOf Paradise by might of waves be moved 830 \r\rOut of his place, pushed by the horned flood, \r\rWith all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift, \r\rDown the great river to the opening Gulf, \r\rAnd there take root, an island salt and bare, \r\rThe haunt of seals, and ores, and sea-mews\' clang:Ji \r\rTo teach thee that God attributes to place \r\rNo sanctity, if none be thither brought \r\rBy men who there frequent or therein dweil. \r\rAnd now what further shall ensue behold." \r\rHe looked, and saw the ark hull on the flood, 840 \rWhich now abated; for the clouds were fled, \rDriven by a keen north-wind, that, blowing dry, \rWrinkled the face of deluge, as decayed; \rAnd the clear sun on his wide watery glass \rGazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew, \rAs after thirst; which made their flowing shrink \rFrom standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole \r\r\r\rBOOK XI. \r\r\r\r339 \r\r\r\rWith soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt \r\rHis sluices, as the heaven his windows shut. \r\rThe ark no more now floats, but seems on ground, 850 \r\rFast on the top of some high mountain fixed. \r\rAnd now the tops of hills as rocks appear ; \r\rWith clamour thence the rapid currents drive \r\rTowards the retreating sea their furious tide. \r\rForthwith from out the ark a raven flies, \r\rAnd after him, the surer messenger, \r\rA dove, sent forth once and again to spy \r\rGreen tree or ground whereon his foot may light; \r\rThe second time returning, in his bill \r\rAn olive-leaf he brings, pacific sign. 860 \r\rAnon dry ground appears, and from his ark \r\rThe ancient sire descends, with all his train; \r\rThen, with uplifted hands and eyes devout, \r\rGrateful to Heaven, over his head beholds \r\rA dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow \r\rConspicuous with three listed colours gay, \r\rBetokening peace from God, and covenant new. \r\rWhereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad, \r\rGreatly rejoiced, and thus his joy broke forth : \r\r"O thou, who future things canst represent 870 \r\rAs present, Heavenly Instructor, I revive \rAt this last sight, assured that Man shall live, \rWith all the creatures, and their seed preserve. \rFar less I now lament for one whole world \rOf wicked sons destroyed, than I rejoice \rFor one man found so perfect and so just, \rThat God vouchsafes to raise another world \rFrom him, and all his anger to forget. \rBut say, what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven, \rDistended as the brow of God appeased? 880 \r\r22 2 \r\r\r\r340 PARADISE LOST. \r\rOr serve they as a flowery verge to bind \rThe fluid skirts of that same watery cloud, \rLest it again dissolve and shower the Earth?" \r\rTo whom the Archangel : " Dextrously thou aim\'st. \rSo willingly doth God remit his ire, \rThough late repenting him of Man depraved; \rGrieved at his heart, when looking down he saw \rThe whole Earth filled with violence, and all flesh \rCorrupting each their way yet, those removed, \rSuch grace shall one just man find in his sight, 890 \r\rThat he relents, not to blot out mankind, \rAnd makes a covenant never to destroy \rThe Earth again by flood, nor let the sea \rSurpass his bounds, nor rain to drown the world \rWith man therein or beast ; but, when he brings \rOver the Earth a cloud, will therein set \rHis triple-coloured bow, whereon to look \rAnd call to mind his covenant. Day and night, \rSeed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost, \r.Shall hold their course, tall- fire purges 11 .thiaa&^new, 900 \riBoth Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell." \r\r\r\rBOOK XII. \r\r\r\rTHE ARGUMENT. \r\rThe Angel Michael continues, from the Flood, to relate what shall \rsucceed; then, in the mention of Abraham, conies by degrees to explain \rwho that Seed of the Woman shall be which was promised Adam and \rEve in the Fall; his incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension; \rthe state of the Church till his second coming. Adam, greatly satisfied \rand recomforted by these relations and promises, descends the hill with \rMichael; wakens Eve, who all this while had slept, but with gentle \rdreams composed to quietness of mind and submission. Michael in \reither hand leads them out of Paradise, the fiery sword waving behind \rthem, and the Cherubim taking their stations to guard the place. \r\r\r\rBOOK XII. \r\r\r\rAS one who in his journey bates at noon, \rThough bent on speed, so here the Archangel paused \rBetwixt the world destroyed and world restored, \rIf Adam aught perhaps might interpose ; \rThen, with transition sweet, new speech resumes: \r\r"Thus thou hast seen one world begin and end, \rAnd Man as from a second stock proceed. \rMuch thou hast yet to see; but I perceive \rThy mortal sight to fail; objects divine \rMust needs impair and weary human sense: 10 \r\rHenceforth what is to come I will relate; \rThou, therefore, give due audience, and attend. \r\r"This second source of men, while yet but few, \rAnd while the dread of judgment past remains \rFresh in their minds, fearing the Deity, \rWith some regard to what is just and right \rShall lead their lives, and multiply apace, \rLabouring the soil, and reaping plenteous crop, \rCorn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock \rOft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid, 20 \r\rWith large wine-offerings poured, and sacred feast, \rShall spend their days in joy unblamed, and dwell \rLong time in peace, by families and tribes, \r\r\r\r344 PARADISE LOST. \r\rUnder paternal rule; till one shall rise, \r\rOf proud, ambitious heart, who, not content \r\rWith fair equality, fraternal state, \r\rWill arrogate dominion undeserved \r\rOver his brethren, and quite dispossess \r\rConcord and law of Nature from the Earth; \r\rHunting (and men, not beasts, shall be his game) 30 \r\rWith war and hostile snare such as refuse \r\rSubjection to his empire tyrannous. \r\rA mighty hunter thence he shall be styled \r\rBefore the Lord, as in despite of Heaven, \r\rOr from Heaven claiming second sovranty; \r\rAnd from rebellion shall derive his name, \r\rThough of rebellion others he accuse. \r\rHe, with a crew, whom like ambition joins \r\rWith him or under him to tyrannize, \r\rMarching from Eden towards the west, shall find 40 \r\rThe plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge \r\rBoils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell. \r\rOf brick, and of that stuff, they cast to build \r\rA city and tower, whose top may reach to Heaven; \r\rAnd get themselves a name, lest, far dispersed \r\rIn foreign lands, their memory be lost, \r\rRegardless whether good or evil fame. \r\rBut God, who oft descends to visit men \r\rUnseen, and through their habitations walks \r\rTo mark their doings, them beholding soon, 50 \r\rComes down to see their city, ere the tower \r\rObstruct Heaven-towers, and in derision sets \r\rUpon their tongues a various spirit, to rase \r\rQuite out their native language, and, instead, \r\rTo sow a jangling noise of words unknown. \r\rForthwith a hideous gabble rises loud \r\r\r\rBOOK xii. 345 \r\rAmong the builders; each to other calls, \r\rNot understood, till hoarse, and all in rage, \r\rAs mocked they storm. Great laughter was in Heaven, \r\rAnd looking down, to see the hubbub strange 60 \r\rAnd hear the din ; thus was the building left \r\rRidiculous, and the work Confusion named." \r\rWhereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased : \r"O execrable son, so to aspire \rAbove his brethren, to himself assuming \rAuthority usurped, from God not given ! \rHe gave us only over beast, fish, fowl, \rDominion absolute; that right we hold \rBy his donation : but man over men \rHe made not lord; such title to himself 70 \r\rReserving, human left from human free. \rBut this usurper his encroachment proud \rStays not on Man; to God his tower intends \rSiege and defiance. Wretched man ! what food \rWill he convey up thither, to sustain \rHimself and his rash army, where thin air \rAbove the clouds will pine his entrails gross, \rAnd famish him of breath, if not of bread?" \r\rTo whom thus Michael: "Justly thou abhorr\'st \rThat son, who on the quiet state of men So \r\rSuch trouble brought, affecting to subdue \rRational liberty; yet know withal, \rSince thy original lapse, true liberty \rIs lost, which always with right reason dwells \rTwinned, and from her hath no dividual being. \rReason in Man obscured, or not obeyed, \rImmediately inordinate desires \rAnd upstart passions catch the government \rFrom reason, and to servitude reduce \r\r\r\r346 PARADISE LOST. \r\rMan, till then free. Therefore, since he permits 90 \r\rWithin himself unworthy powers to reign \r\rOver free reason, God, in judgment just, \r\rSubjects him from without to violent lords, \r\rWho oft as undeservedly enthral \r\rHis outward freedom : tyranny must be, \r\rThough to the tyrant thereby no excuse. \r\rYet sometimes nations will decline so low \r\rFrom virtue, which is reason, that no wrong, \r\rBut justice, and some fatal curse annexed, \r\rDeprives them of their outward liberty, 100 \r\rTheir inward lost : witness the irreverent son \r\rOf him who built the ark, who, for the shame \r\rDone to his father, heard this heavy curse, \r\rServant of servants, on his vicious race. \r\rThus will this latter, as the former world, \r\rStill tend from bad to worse, till God at last, \r\rWearied with their iniquities, withdraw \r\rHis presence from among them, and avert \r\rHis holy eyes; resolving from thenceforth \r\rTo leave them to their own polluted ways, no \r\rAnd one peculiar nation to select \r\rFrom all the rest, of whom to be invoked \r\rA nation from one faithful man to spring. \r\rHim on this side Euphrates yet residing, \r\rBred up in idol-worship Oh, that men \r\r(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, \r\rWhile yet the patriarch lived who scaped the Flood, \r\rAs to forsake the living God, and fall \r\rTo worship their own work in wood and stone \r\rFor gods ! yet him God the Most High vouchsafes 120 \r\rTo call by vision from his father\'s house, \r\rHis kindred, and false gods, into a land \r\r\r\rBOOK XII. 347 \r\rWhich he will show him, and from him will raise \r\rA mighty nation, and upon him shower \r\rHis benediction so, that in his seed \r\rAll nations shall be blest. He straight obeys; \r\rNot knowing to what land, yet firm believes. \r\rI see him, but thou canst not, with what faith \r\rHe leaves his gods, his friends, and native soil, \r\rUr of Chaldaea, passing now the ford 130 \r\rTo Haran ; after him a cumbrous train \r\rOf herds and flocks, and numerous servitude, \r\rNot wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth \r\rWith God, who called him, in a land unknown. \r\rCanaan he now attains; I see his tents \r\rPitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring plain \r\rOf Moreh ; there, by promise, he receives \r\rGift to his progeny of all that land, \r\rFrom Hamath northward to the Desert south \r\r(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed), 140 \r\rFrom Hermon east to the great western sea; \r\rMount Hermon, yonder sea, each place behold \r\rIn prospect, as I point them : on the shore, \r\rMount Carmel ; here, the double-founted stream, \r\rJordan, true limit eastward; but his sons \r\rShall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills. \r\rThis ponder, that all nations of the Earth \r\rShall in his seed be blessed. By that seed \r\rIs meant thy great Deliverer, who shall bruise \r\rThe Serpent\'s head; whereof to thee anon 150 \r\rPlainlier shall be revealed. This patriarch blest, \r\rWhom faithful Abraham due time shall call, \r\rA son, and of his son a grandchild, leaves, \r\rLike him in faith, in wisdom, and renown. \r\rThe grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs \r\r\r\r348 PARADISE LOST. \r\rFrom Canaan to a land hereafter called \r\rEgypt, divided by the river Nile; \r\rSee where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths \r\rInto the sea. To sojourn in that land \r\rHe comes, invited by a younger son 160 \r\rIn time of dearth, a son whose worthy deeds \r\rRaise him to be the second in that realm \r\rOf Pharaoh. There he dies, and leaves his race \r\rGrowing into a nation, and now grown \r\rSuspected to a sequent king, who seeks \r\rTo stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests \r\rToo numerous ; whence of guests he makes them slaves \r\rInhospitably, and kills their infant males : \r\rTill, by two brethren (those two brethren call \r\rMoses and Aaron) sent from God to claim 170 \r\rHis people from enthralment, they return, \r\rWith glory and spoil, back to their promised land. \r\rBut first the lawless tyrant, who denies \r\rTo know their God, or message to regard, \r\rMust be compelled by signs and judgments dire: \r\rTo blood unshed the rivers must be turned; \r\rFrogs, lice, and flies must all his palace fill \r\rWith loathed intrusion, and fill all the land; \r\rHis cattle must of rot and murrain die ; \r\rBotches and blains must all his flesh emboss, 180 \r\rAnd all his people; thunder mixed with hail, \r\rHail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptian sky, \r\rAnd wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls; \r\rWhat it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain, \r\rA darksome cloud of locusts swarming down \r\rMust eat, and on the ground leave nothing green; \r\rDarkness must overshadow all his bounds, \r\rPalpable darkness, and blot out three days; \r\r\r\rBOOK xii. 349 \r\rLast, with one midnight-stroke, all the first-born \r\rOf Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds 150 \r\rThe river-dragon tamed at length submits \r\rTo let his sojourners depart, and oft \r\rHumbles his stubborn heart, but still as ice \r\rMore hardened after thaw; till, in his rage \r\rPursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea \r\rSwallows him with his host, but them lets pass, \r\rAs on dry land, between two crystal walls, \r\rAwed by the rod of Moses so to stand \r\rDivided, till his rescued gain their shore : \r\rSuch wondrous power God to his Saint will lend, 200 \r\rThough present in his Angel, who shall go \r\rBefore them in a cloud, and pillar of fire \r\rBy day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire \r\rTo guide them in their journey, and remove \r\rBehind them, while the obdurate king pursues. \r\rAll night he will pursue, but his approach \r\rDarkness defends between till morning-watch ; \r\rThen through the fiery pillar and the cloud \r\rGod looking forth will trouble all his host, \r\rAnd craze their chariot-wheels : when, by command, 210 \r\rMoses once more his potent rod extends \r\rOver the sea; the sea his rod obeys; \r\rOn their embattled ranks the waves return, \r\rAnd overwhelm their war. The race elect \r\rSafe towards Canaan from the shore advance \r\rThrough the wild Desert, not the readiest way; \r\rLest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed, \r\rWar terrify them inexpert, and fear \r\rReturn them back to Egypt, choosing rather \r\rInglorious life with servitude; for life 220 \r\rTo noble and ignoble is more sweet \r\r\r\r350 PARADISE LOST. \r\rUntrained in arms, where rashness leads not on. \r\rThis also shall they gain by their delay \r\rIn the wide wilderness : there they shall found \r\rTheir government, and their great Senate choose \r\rThrough the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained. \r\rGod, from the mount of Sinai, whose grey top \r\rShall tremble, he descending, will himself \r\rIn thunder, lightning, and loud trumpet\'s sound, \r\rOrdain them laws; part, such as appertain 230 \r\rTo civil justice; part, religious rites \r\rOf sacrifice, informing them, by types \r\rAnd shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise \r\rThe Serpent, by what means he shall achieve \r\rMankind\'s deliverance. But the voice of God \r\rTo mortal ear is dreadful; they beseech \r\rThat Moses might report to them his will, \r\rAnd terror cease; he grants what they besought, \r\rInstructed that to God is no access \r\rWithout Mediator, whose high office now 240 \r\rMoses in figure bears, to introduce \r\rOne greater, of whose day he shall foretell, \r\rAnd all the Prophets, in their age, the times \r\rOf great Messiah shall sing. Thus laws and rites \r\rEstablished, such delight hath God in men \r\rObedient to his will, that he vouchsafes \r\rAmong them to set up his tabernacle \r\rThe Holy One with mortal men to dwell. \r\rBy his prescript a sanctuary is framed \r\rOf cedar, overlaid with gold; therein 250 \r\rAn ark, and in the ark his testimony, \r\rThe records of his covenant; over these \r\rA mercy-seat of gold, between the wings \r\rOf two bright Cherubim; before him burn \r\r\r\rBOOK XII. 351 \r\rSeven lamps, as in a zodiac representing \r\rThe heavenly fires. Over the tent a cloud \r\rShall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night, \r\rSave when they journey; and at length they come, \r\rConducted by his Angel, to the land \r\rPromised to Abraham and his seed. The rest 260 \r\rWere long to tell : how many battles fought ; \r\rHow many kings destroyed, and kingdoms won; \r\rOr how the sun shall in mid-heaven stand still \r\rA day entire, and night\'s due course adjourn, \r\rMan\'s voice commanding, \' Sun, in Gibeon stand, \r\rAnd thou, Moon, in the vale of Aialon, \r\rTill Israel overcome ! \' so call the third \r\rFrom Abraham, son of Isaac, and from him \r\rHis whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win." \r\rHere Adam interposed : " O sent from Heaven, 270 \rEnlightener of my darkness, gracious things \rThou hast revealed, those chiefly which concern \rJust Abraham and his seed. Now first I find \rMine eyes true opening, and my heart much eased, \rErewhile perplexed with thoughts what would become \rOf me and all mankind ; but now I see \rHis day, in whom all nations shall be blest, \rFavour unmerited by me, who sought \rForbidden knowledge by forbidden means. \rThis yet I apprehend not, why to those 280 \r\rAmong whom God will deign to dwell on Earth \rSo many and so various laws are given : \rSo many laws argue so many sins \rAmong them; how can God with such reside?" \r\rTo whom thus Michael : " Doubt not but that sin \rWill reign among them, as of thee begot ; \rAnd therefore was law given them, to evince \r\r\r\r352 PARADISE LOST. \r\rTheir natural pravity, by stirring up \r\rSin against law to fight; that, when they see \r\rLaw can discover sin, but not remove, 290 \r\rSave by those shadowy expiations weak. \r\rThe blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude \r\rSome blood more precious must be paid for Man, \r\rJust for unjust, that in such righteousness, \r\rTo them by faith imputed, they may find \r\rJustification towards God, and peace \r\rOf conscience, which the law by ceremonies \r\rCannot appease, nor man the moral part \r\rPerform, and not performing cannot live. \r\rSo law appears imperfect, and but given 300 \r\rWith purpose to resign them, in full time, \r\rUp to a better covenant, disciplined \r\rFrom shadowy types to truth, from flesh to spirit, \r\rFrom imposition of strict laws to free \r\rAcceptance of large grace, from servile fear \r\rTo filial, works of law to works of faith. \r\rAnd therefore shall not Moses, though of God \r\rHighly beloved, being but the minister \r\rOf law, his people into Canaan lead; \r\rBut Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call, 310 \r\rHis name and office bearing, who shall quell \r\rThe adversary Serpent, and bring back \r\rThrough the world\'s wilderness long-wandered Man \r\rSafe to eternal Paradise of rest. \r\rMeanwhile they, in their earthly Canaan placed, \r\rLong time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins \r\rNational interrupt their public peace, \r\rProvoking God to raise them enemies \r\rFrom whom as oft he saves them penitent, \r\rBy Judges first, then under Kings ; of whom 320 \r\r\r\rBOOK xii. 353 \r\rThe second, both for piety renowned \rAnd puissant deeds, a promise shall receive \rIrrevocable, that his regal throne \rFor ever shall endure. The like shall sing \rAll Prophecy that of the royal stock \rOf David (so I name this king) shall rise \rA Son, the Woman\'s Seed to thee foretold, \rForetold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust \rAll nations, and to kings foretold, of kings \r! The last, for of his reign shall be no end. 330 \r\r\\ But first a long succession must ensue ; \rAnd his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed, \rThe clouded ark of God, till then in tents \rWandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine. \rSuch follow him as shall be registered \rPart good, part bad ; of bad the longer scroll ; \rWhose foul idolatries and other faults, \rHeaped to the popular sum, will so incense \rGod, as to leave them, and expose their land, \rTheir city, his temple, and his holy ark, 340 \r\rWith all his sacred things, a scorn and prey \rTo that proud city, whose high walls thou saw\'st \rLeft in confusion, Babylon thence called. \rThere in captivity he lets them dwell \rThe space of seventy years; then brings them back, \rRemembering mercy, and his covenant sworn \rTo David, stablished as the days of Heaven. \rReturned from Babylon by leave of kings, \rTheir lords, whom God disposed, the house of God \rThey first re-edify, and for a while 350 \r\rIn mean estate live moderate, till, grown \rIn wealth and multitude, factious they grow. \rBut first among the priests dissension springs, \r\r\r\r354 PARADISE LOST. \r\rMen who attend the altar, and should most \r\rEndeavour peace; their strife pollution brings \r\rUpon the temple itself; at last they seize \r\rThe sceptre, and regard not David\'s sons; \r\rThen lose it to a stranger, that the true \r\rAnointed King Messiah might be born \r\rBarred of his right. Yet at his birth a star, 360 \r\rUnseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come, \r\rAnd guides the eastern sages, who inquire \r\rHis place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold : \r\rHis place of birth a solemn Angel tells \r\rTo simple shepherds, keeping watch by night; \r\rThey gladly thither haste, and by a quire \r\rOf squadroned Angels hear his carol sung. \r\rA Virgin is his mother, but his Sire \r\rThe Power of the Most High. He shall ascend \r\rThe throne hereditary, and bound his reign 370 \r\rWith Earth\'s wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens." \r\rHe ceased, discerning Adam with such joy \rSurcharged as had, like grief, been dewed in tears, \rWithout the vent of words ; which these he breathed : \r\r"O prophet of glad tidings, finisher \rOf utmost hope ! now clear I understand \rWhat oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain; \rWhy our great Expectation should be called \rThe Seed of Woman. Virgin Mother, hail ! \rHigh in the love of Heaven, yet from my loins 380 \r\rThou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son \rOf God Most High; so God with Man unites. \rNeeds must the Serpent now his capital bruise \rExpect with mortal pain : say where and when \rTheir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victor\'s heel." \r\rTo whom thus Michael : " Dream not of their fight \r\r\r\rBOOK xii. 355 \r\rAs of a duel, or the local wounds \r\rOf head or heel. Not therefore joins the Son \r\rManhood to Godhead, with more strength to foil \r\rThy enemy; nor so is overcome 390 \r\rSatan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise, \r\rDisabled not to give thee thy death\'s wound; \r\rWhich he who comes thy Saviour shall recure, \r\rNot by destroying Satan, but his works \r\rIn thee and in thy seed. Nor can this be, \r\rBut by fulfilling that which thou didst want, \r\rObedience to the law of God, imposed \r\rOn penalty of death, and suffering death, \r\rThe penalty to thy transgression due, \r\rAnd due to theirs which out of thine will grow : 400 \r\rSo only can high justice rest appaid. \r\rThe law of God exact he shall fulfil \r\rBoth by obedience and by love, though love \r\rAlone fulfil the law; thy punishment \r\rHe shall endure, by coming in the flesh \r\rTo a reproachful life and cursed death, \r\rProclaiming life to all who shall believe \r\rIn his redemption, and that his obedience \r\rImputed becomes theirs by faith his merits \r\rTo save them, not their own, though legal, works. 410 \r\rFor this he shall live hated, be blasphemed, \r\rSeized on by force, judged, and to death condemned, \r\rA shameful and accursed, nailed to the cross \r\rBy his own nation, slain for bringing life; \r\rBut to the cross he nails thy enemies, \r\rThe law that is against thee, and the sins \r\rOf all mankind, with him there crucified, \r\rNever to hurt them more who rightly trust \r\rIn this his satisfaction. So he dies, \r\r232 \r\r\r\r356 PARADISE LOST. \r\rBut soon revives; Death over him no power 420 \r\rShall long usurp; ere the third dawning light \r\rReturn, the stars of morn shall see him rise \r\rOut of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, \r\rThy ransom paid, which Man from Death redeems, \r\rHis death for Man as many as offered life \r\rNeglect not, and the benefit embrace \r\rBy faith not void of works. This godlike act \r\rAnnuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have died, \r\rIn sin for ever lost from life; this act \r\rShall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength, 430 \r\rDefeating Sin and Death, his two main arms, \r\rAnd fix far deeper in his head their stings \r\rThan temporal death shall bruise the Victor\'s heel, \r\rOr theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep, \r\rA gentle wafting to immortal life. \r\rNor after resurrection shall he stay \r\rLonger on Earth than certain times to appear \r\rTo his disciples, men who in his life \r\rStill followed him ; to them shall leave in charge \r\rTo teach all nations what of him they learned 440 \r\rAnd his salvation, them who shall believe \r\rBaptizing in the profluent stream the sign \r\rOf washing them from guilt of sin to life \r\rPure, and in mind prepared, if so befall, \r\rFor death like that which the Redeemer died. \r\rAll nations they shall teach; for from that day \r\rNot only to the sons of Abraham\'s loins \r\rSalvation shall be preached, but to the sons \r\rOf Abraham\'s faith wherever through the world ; \r\rSo in his seed all nations shall be blest. 450 \r\rThen to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend \r\rWith victory, triumphing through the air \r\r\r\rBOOK xii. 357 \r\rOver his foes and thine; there shall surprise \r\rThe Serpent, Prince of air, and drag in chains \r\rThrough all his realm, and there confounded leave; \r\rThen enter into glory, and resume \r\rHis seat at God\'s right hand, exalted high \r\rAbove all names in Heaven; and thence shall come, \r\rWhen this world\'s dissolution shall be ripe, \r\rWith glory and power, to judge both quick and dead 460 \r\rTo judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward \r\rHis faithful, and receive them into bliss, \r\rWhether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth \r\rShall all be Paradise, far happier place \r\rThan this of Eden, and far happier days." \r\rSo spake the Archangel Michael ; then paused, \rAs at the world\'s great period ; and our Sire, \rReplete with joy and wonder, thus replied : \r\r" O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense ! \rThat all this good of evil shall produce, 470 \r\rAnd evil turn to good; more wonderful \rThan that which by creation first brought forth \rLight out of darkness ! . Full of doubt I stand, \rWhether I should repent me now of sin \rBy me done and occasioned, or rejoice \rMuch more, that much more good thereof shall spring; \rTo God more glory, more good-will to men \rFrom God, and over wrath grace shall abound. \rBut say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven \rMust reascend, what will betide the few, 480 \r\rHis faithful, left among the unfaithful herd, \rThe enemies of truth. Who then shall guide \rHis people, who defend? Will they not deal \rWorse with his followers than with him they dealt?" \r\r" Be sure they will," said the Angel ; " but from Heaven \r\r\r\r358 PARADISE LOST. \r\rHe to his own a Comforter will send, \r\rThe promise of the Father, who shall dwell, \r\rHis Spirit, within them, and the law of faith, \r\rWorking through love, upon their hearts shall write, \r\rTo guide them in all truth, and also arm 490 \r\rWith spiritual armour, able to resist \r\rSatan\'s assaults, and quench his fiery darts; \r\rWhat man can do against them not afraid, \r\rThough to the death; against such cruelties \r\rWith inward consolations recompensed, \r\rAnd oft supported so as shall amaze \r\rTheir proudest persecutors. For the Spirit, \r\rPoured first on his Apostles, whom he sends \r\rTo evangelize the nations, then on all \r\rBaptized, shall them with wondrous gifts endue 500 \r\rTo speak all tongues, and do all miracles, \r\rAs did their Lord before them. Thus they win \r\rGreat numbers of each nation to receive \r\rWith joy the tidings brought from Heaven : at length \r\rTheir ministry performed, and race well run, \r\rTheir doctrine and their story written left, \r\rThey die; but in their room, as they forewarn, \r\rWolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves, \r\rWho all the sacred mysteries of Heaven \r\rTo their own vile advantages shall turn 510 \r\rOf lucre and ambition, and the truth \r\rWith superstitions and traditions taint, \r\rLeft only in those written records pure, \r\rThough not but by the Spirit understood. \r\rThen shall they seek to avail themselves of names, \r\rPlaces, and titles, and with these to join \r\rSecular power, though feigning still to act \r\rBy spiritual; to themselves appropriating \r\r\r\rBOOK xii. 359 \r\rThe Spirit of God, promised alike and given \r\rTo all believers; and, from that pretence, 520 \r\rSpiritual laws by carnal power shall force \r\rOn every conscience, laws which none shall find \r\rLeft them enrolled, or what the Spirit within \r\rShall on the heart engrave. What will they then, \r\rBut force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind \r\rHis consort, Liberty? what but unbuild \r\rHis living temples, built by faith to stand, \r\rTheir own faith, not another\'s? for, on Earth, \r\rWho against faith and conscience can be heard \r\rInfallible ? Yet many will presume : 530 \r\rWhence heavy persecution shall arise \r\rOn all who in the worship persevere \r\rOf Spirit and Truth; the rest, far greater part, \r\rWill deem in outward rites and specious forms \r\rReligion satisfied; Truth shall retire \r\rBestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith \r\rRarely be found. So shall the world go on, \r\rTo good malignant, to bad men benign, \r\rUnder her own weight groaning till the day \r\rAppear of respiration to the just, 540 \r\rAnd vengeance to the wicked, at return \r\rOf Him so lately promised to thy aid, \r\rThe Woman\'s Seed obscurely then foretold, \r\rNow amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord ; \r\rLast in the clouds from Heaven to be revealed \r\rIn glory of the Father, to dissolve \r\rSatan with his perverted world ; then raise \r\rFrom the conflagrant mass, purged and refined, \r\rNew Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date, \r\rFounded in righteousness and peace and love, 550 \r\rTo bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss." \r\r\r\r360 PARADISE LOST. \r\rHe ended ; and thus Adam last replied : \r"How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, \rMeasured this transient world, the race of time, \rTill time stand fixed ! Beyond is all abyss, \rEternity, whose end no eye can reach. \rGreatly instructed I shall hence depart, \rGreatly in peace of thought, and have my fill \rOf knowledge, what this vessel can contain ; \rBeyond which was my folly to aspire. 560 \r\rHenceforth I learn that to obey is best, \rAnd love with fear the only God, to walk \rAs in his presence, ever to observe \rHis providence, and on him sole depend, \rMerciful over all his works, with good \rStill overcoming evil, and by small \rAccomplishing great things, by things deemed weak \rSubverting worldly-strong, and worldly-wise \rBy simply meek; that suffering for truth\'s sake \rIs fortitude to highest victory, r; \r\rAnd, to the faithful, death the gate of life; \rTaught this by his example whom I now \rAcknowledge my Redeemer ever blest" \r\rTo whom thus also the Angel last replied: \r"This having learned, thou hast attained the sum \rOf wisdom ; hope no higher, though all the stars \rThou knew\'st by name, and all the ethereal powers, \rAll secrets of the deep, all Nature\'s works, \rOr works of God in Heaven, air, Earth, or sea, \rAnd all the riches of this world enjoy\'dst, 580 \r\rAnd all the rule, one empire. Only add \rDeeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith, \rAdd virtue, patience, temperance; add love, \rBy name to come called charity, the soul \r\r\r\rBOOK XII. 361 \r\rall the rest : then wilt them not be loth \rTo leave this Paradise, but shalt possess \rA Paradise within thee, happier far. \r\r^Eet us descend now, therefore, from this top \rOf speculation ; for the hour precise \rExacts our parting hence ; and, see ! the guards, 590 \r\rBy me encamped on yonder hill, expect \rTheir motion, at whose front a flaming sword, \rIn signal of remove, waves fiercely round. \rWe may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; \rHer also I with gentle dreams have calmed, \rPortending good, and all her spirits composed \rTo meek submission : thou, at season fit, \rLet her with thee partake what thou hast heard; \rChiefly what may concern her faith to know, \rThe great deliverance by her seed to come 600 \r\r(For by the Woman\'s Seed) on all mankind; \rThat ye may live, which will be many days, \rBoth in one faith unanimous ; though sad \rWith cause for evils past, yet much more cheered \rWith meditation on the happy end." \r\rHe ended, and they both descend the hill. \rDescended, Adam to the bower where Eve \rLay sleeping ran before, but found her waked; \rAnd thus with words not sad she him received : \r\r"Whence thou return\'st, and whither went\'st, I know; 610 \rFor God is also in sleep, and dreams advise, \rWhich he hath sent propitious, some great good \rPresaging, since with sorrow and heart\'s distress \rWearied I fell asleep. But now lead on; \rIn me is no delay; with thee to go \r\rJIs to stay here; without thee here to stay \r\rv ] Is to go hence unwilling ; thou to me \r\r\r\r362 PARADISE LOST. \r\rArt all things under Heaven, all places thou, \r\rWho for my wilful crime art banished hence. \r\rThis further consolation yet secure 620 \r\rI carry hence : though all by me is lost, \r\rSuch favour I unworthy am vouchsafed, \r\rBy me the Promised Seed shall all restore." \r\rSo spake our mother Eve, and Adam heard \rWell pleased, but answered not; for now too nigh \rThe Archangel stood, and from the other hill \rTo their fixed station, all in bright array, \rThe Cherubim descended; on the ground \rGliding meteorous, as evening mist \r\rRisen from a river o\'er the marish glides, 630 \r\rAnd gathers ground fast at the labourer\'s heel \rHomeward returning. High in front advanced, \rThe brandished sword of God before them blazed, \rFierce as a comet; which with torrid heat, \rAnd vapour as the Libyan air adust, \rBegan to parch that temperate clime; whereat \rIn either hand the hastening angel caught \rOur lingering parents, and to the eastern gate \rLed them direct, and down the cliff as fast \rTo the subjected plain; then disappeared. 640 \r\rThey, looking back, all the eastern side beheld \rOf Paradise, so late their happy seat, \rWaved over by that flaming brand; the gate \rWith dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms. \rSome natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon; \rThe world was all before them, where to choose \rTheir place of rest, and Providence their guide. \rThey, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, \r[Through Eden took their solitary way. \r\r\r\rNOTES \r\r\r\rNOTES \r\r\r\rCOMMENDATORY VERSES. \r\rFirst printed in 1674. I number the lines of each poem for con- \rvenience of reference. \r\rI. The Latin elegiacs : the author of these was Samuel Barrow, a \rCambridge man of note. Born in 1625 he graduated from Trinity in \r1643, and afterwards attained to some celebrity in medicine. He was \rappointed Physician in Ordinary to Charles II. in August, 1660, and \rdied in 1682. His Royalist sympathies evidently did not prevent him \rfrom being an admirer of Milton. Curiously enough, his poetic sum- \rmary of the contents of the Epic includes no direct reference to the \rTemptation and Fall of Man. He is most struck with the war in \rHeaven and Satan\'s expulsion. \r\ri. Amissam\\ the masculine were more correct; cf. the title of \rHogg\'s once well-known translation Paraphrasis Poetica in tria \rJohannis Miltoni Poemata, viz. Paradisum Amissum, Paradisuni \rRecuperatum, et Samsonem Agonisten (1690). \r\r9. pontum\'y no doubt, the right reading. It may, however, be \rnoted that both the second and third editions of Paradise Lost have \rportum (which Keightley retained, with what sense is not clear). \r\r15. futurum ; so the second and third editions, but many later \rtexts print futtira. As the line stands it seems to mean (if we may \rreproduce the baldness of the original), * who could believe that there \rwould be any one who would conceive hopes of these things ? \' i.e. be \rso ambitious. But probably the author intended futura (or wrote hoc), \r\rI ^ 38. These lines, nearly half the poem, allude to bk. vi. of \rP. Z.; see VI. 245327, 63470, 749 879- \r\r30. currus animes, the Cherubic chariot (vi. 750 56). \r\r39 42. Lauder placed these verses ironically on the title-page \rof his Essay (1750). \r\r42. Alluding to the Homeric "Battle of the Frogs and Mice," \rand the Vergilian "Culex." Cf. Dryden\'s lines on Milton. \r\rII. The English verses: the writer was Andrew Marvell (1620 \r78), poet and politician. In 1657 he had been made assistant secretary \rto Milton while the latter still held office under the Council. At the \rRestoration he did Milton good service "acted vigorously in his \r\r\r\r366 PARADISE LOST. BOOK I. \r\rbehalf and made a considerable party for him" (says Phillips, Memoir}. \rMarvell\'s poetry shows Milton\'s influence clearly ; see Lycidas, 40, note. \r\r9. Samson Agonistes had been published (1671). \r\r12. success, result, issue. \r\r26. pretend, claim falsely. \r\r37 40. See P. L. i. 13 15. A correspondent of Notes and Queries \rpointed out that " the bird" (39) meant is the bird of Paradise and that \rMarvell refers to the old notion, believed till the end of the last century, \rthat it was footless: cf. "always keeps on wing." So in Lyly\'s play, \rLove\'s Metamorphosis, iv. i, the bird of Paradise is described as " that \rbird that liveth only by air, and dieth if she touch the earth " (Bond\'s \rLyly, in. 319). Cf. too a complimentary poem (1647) to Fletcher \r(p. xlii. vol. i. in the Cambridge Beaumont and Fletcher] : \r"But thou art still that Bird of Paradise \rWhich hath no feet and ever nobly flies." \r\r42. expense] some texts print expanse. \r\r43. See P. L. in. 3236. \r\r47 5- A sarcasm against Dryden, who, as the champion of \rrhymed plays, had under the name of "Bayes" been satirised in \rBuckingham\'s Rehearsal (1671) an attack which he repaid with \rinterest in Absalom and Achitophel. . The allusion comes naturally \rfrom Marvell, who had himself borrowed the title of The Rehearsal \rfor his chief prose work, 7"he Rehearsal Transprosed, a long polemical \rpamphlet in two parts (167273), in which his opponent figures \rthroughout as "Mr Bayes." Milton was thought to have helped him \rin writing Part I., but Marvell denies this in Part II. See Aitken\'s \rMarvell, "Poems," p. 209, and Birrell\'s Life, chap. v. Dryden (as \rwe learn from Aubrey) on one of his visits to Milton asked per- \rmission to "put his Paradise Lost into a drama in rhyme. Mr Milton \rreceived him cordially, and told him he would give him leave to tag his \rverses" : the outcome being his opera The State of Innocence and Fall \rof Man, published in 1674, the very year in which, apparently, Marvell \rwrote these verses. Milton may have talked the matter over with \rMarvell (so Masson thinks) ; or, perhaps, it had become a piece of \rcontemporary gossip among literary men. Either way, the reference \rhere is not to be mistaken. \r\r49. fancies. Keightley faces, points, the tagged laces used to tie \rparts of the dress, especially the breeches ; mentioned often in \rShakespeare. \r\r51, 52. the mode, the fashion of rhyming. He means that he \rwould use the word praise rather than the weaker term commend, \rhad he not to find a rhyme with offend. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 367 \r\r\r\rTHE VERSE. \r\ri. rime; the older and more correct spelling of rhyme. \r\r10. Cf. the similar appeal to the example of Italian writers in the \rPreface to S. A. Italian works in blank verse (versi sciolti) which \rillustrate what Milton says in both places are : Trissino\'s tragedy \rSofonisba, written about 1514, and his heroic poem Italia Liberata, \rpublished 1548 (cf. Johnson\'s Life of M. ad Jin.) ; Ruccelai\'s Rosmunda \r(1516), modelled on Sofonisba\', Tasso\'s poem on the Creation; and \rAlamanni\'s didactic work La Coltivazione (1546). The influence of \rItalian poetry on Milton is seen also in the free ( \' Apolelymenos \') \rmeasures of the choruses of Samson Agonistes, and in Lycidas. \r\r"Among the Spanish poets, Mr Bowie mentions Francisco de \rAldana, who translated the Epistles of Ovid into Spanish blank verse ; \rand Gonsalvo Perez, who, in like manner, translated the Odyssey of \rHomer" (Todd). \r\rn, 12. Scarcely pleasant reading for Dryden who had defended \rrhyme, and whose rhymed dramas were appearing in quick succession. \rWe have, I believe, a similar hit at him in the Preface to *$". A. In \rthe Preface to his Juvenal Dryden retorted that whatever might be \rMilton\'s "alleged" reasons for "the abolishing of rhyme," the real \rreason was "that rhyme was not his talent." \r\r20. Practically it was quite true that Paradise Lost was the first \rgreat English poem, of a non-dramatic type, written in blank verse, \rthough Surrey had used a rhymeless measure in his translation of the \rsecond (1557) and fourth (1548) books of the ALneid\\ cf. Ascham\'s \rSchoolmaster (1570), " The noble Lord Th\' Earle of Surrey, first of all \rEnglish men, in translating the fourth booke of Virgill...auoyded the \rfault of Ryming" (Bonn\'s ed., p. 217). There are also some blank verse \rpieces by Nicholas Grimald in Tottel\'s Miscellany (1557) e.g. "The \rDeath of Zoroas," Arber\'s ed., pp. 120 23, and "Ciceroes death," \rpp. 12325. And Gascoigne\'s Steele Glas (1576) is " written without \rrime," as he notes in the " Epistle Dedicatorie " (Arber, p. 45). But \rthese works, though interesting to the student, have no great intrinsic \rmerit, and Milton\'s claim is substantially unimpeachable. The next \rlong epic after Paradise Lost in blank verse was Phillips\' Cider (1706), \ran imitation of the Georgics ; and Thomson (Autumn) in addressing \rPhillips says : \r\r\' \' the second thou \r\rWho nobly durst in rhyme-unfettered verse \rWith British freedom sing the British song " ; \r\ran obvious allusion to Milton (whom Thomson imitates constantly) \rand this Preface. \r\r\r\r368 PARADISE LOST. BOOK I. \r\r\r\rBOOK I. \r\rAbbreviations : \r\rM. = Milton, or Milton\'s poetry, as distinguished from his prose. \r\rP. W. Milton\'s prose-works (in " Bohn\'s Standard Library"). \r\rP. R. = Paradise Regained. \r\rS.A. = Samson Agonist \'es. \r\rNat. Ode = Ode On the Morning of Chris? s Nativity. \rOther books of Paradise Lost are indicated by Roman numerals. \r\ri 6. Like Homer and Vergil he indicates the theme of his poem \rat the outset. Cf. the beginning of Paradise Regained : \r" I, who erewhile the happy Garden sung \rBy one man\'s disobedience lost, now sing \rRecovered Paradise to all mankind, \rBy one man\'s firm obedience fully tried \rThrough all temptation, and the Tempter foiled \rIn all his wiles, defeated and repulsed, \rAnd Eden raised in the waste Wilderness." \r2. mortal, deadly the late Lat. use of mortalis. \r4. Eden = Paradise, one greater Man, the Messiah ; Romans v. 1 9. \r6 1 6. The invocation of the Muse is an epic convention ; like \rDante and Tasso, M. follows therein Homer and Vergil. The signifi- \rcance lies in his choice of a power to be addressed : not one of the \rNine Muses to whom a Greek or Roman poet would have appealed, but \rthe Muse of sacred song, the Heavenly power which inspired Moses on \rSinai, and David on Zion, and the other prophets of Israel. Twice he \rspeaks of great singers as "taught by the Heavenly Muse" (in. 19, \rComus, 515), and in VII. i 4 he gives her the name "Urania," \'the \rHeavenly.\' Book vii. i 39, where, having completed half his task, \rthe poet petitions the Muse afresh, should be compared with this \rpassage. \r\r6. Perhaps secret ~Lrt.. secretns, \'apart, retired\'; cf. n. 891. \r\r7. Oreb, or. ..Sinai. M. may be referring to the two occasions on \rwhich Moses received a Divine communication (i) when the Lord, \rappeared to him in a burning bush, Exod. iii. ; (2) when he was given \rthe Law, Exod. xix. xxxi. Myself, I believe that only the latter is \rintended, and that M., contrasting Exod. xix. 20 with Dent. iv. 10, \rdoes not decide whether the mountain where Moses received the Law \r\r\r\r\r\r\rNOTES. 369 \r\r\r\rshould be called "Oreb or Sinai." The accounts can be harmonised \reasily : Horeb was the whole range, Sinai its lower part. Why in P. L. \r(cf. xi. 74) M. prefers Oreb to Horeb, I do not know: in the Cambridge \rMSS. is the entry: "the golden calfe, or the massacre in Horeb." \r\r8. that shepherd, Moses, who " kept the flock of Jethro " on Horeb, \rExod. iii. i. first taught; in Genesis i. Of course, M. drew largely on \rthe Mosaic books of the Old Testament. \r\r9, 10. the Heavens, i.e. the sky and starry realms of this Universe. \rChaos = "\\\\\\Q vast Abyss," 21 ; "the gloomy deep," 152. \r\r1012. Cf. in. 30, 31. \r\rSiloa s brook\\ more familiar to us in the description "pool," through \rJohn ix. 7, 1 1 ; but Isaiah\'s words, of which M. may be thinking "the \rwaters of Shiloah that go softly," viii. 6 imply that the waters of the \rpool overflowed into the garden below and so formed a streamlet, \rwhich would find its way into the Kidron. Josephus notes the \rabundant water of Siloa (which he always calls a spring, ^77777), \rBellunijudaicuni) V. 4. i. The form Siloa illustrates Milton\'s dislike of \rsh ; see the note on 398. The Septuagint has ZiXwd/t, the Vulgate Siloe. \r\rThe reason, doubtless, why M. specially refers to Siloa is this. The \rMuses (says Hesiod, at the beginning of the Theogony) frequent "the \rdark-coloured spring (Aganippe)... and altar of Zeus." Imitating that \rpassage in Lycidas, 15, (6, M. addresses the Muses as \r\r"Sisters of the sacred well, \r\rThat from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring." \rHe connects the spring with the altar cf. // Penseroso, 48 to show \rthe sanctity of poetic inspiration. Here he takes Hesiod\'s thought, \rwhich he before presented in its classical dress, and gives it a Scriptural \rinvestiture : the result being a complete parallel between the classical \rMuses who haunt the spring that rises by the altar of Zeus, and the \rHeavenly Muse who haunts the spring that flows by the Temple ("the \roracle") ot the Almighty. \r\r12. fast by, close by. Siloa was outside Jerusalem, in the valley \rthat skirted Mt Moriah, on which stood the Temple, oracle, "thy \rholy oracle," Psalm xxviii. 2. \r\r14. The metaphor in "flight," "soar," is a iavourite with M. \rCf. HI. 13, vn. 3, 4, ix. 45. no middle flight \', i.e. he will ascend to \rthe highest Empyrean. \r\r14, 15. He hopes to be filled with a higher inspiration, so as to \rtreat of higher things, than the classical poets whose inspiration came \rfrom the Muses of antiquity. the Aonian motmt^ Helicon, in \rBceotia; sacred to the Muses whence their title Aonides. Pope \r\rP. L. 2A \r\r\r\r370 PARADISE LOST. BOOK I. \r\rcalls them "Aonian maids" (Messiah], and Campbell, "Aonian \rMuses" (Pleasures of Hope). \r\r15. pursues, treats of; " in the sense of the Latin sequor. E noto \rfctum carmen sequar, Horace, Ars Poetica 240" (Keightley). \r\r16. This claim to novelty of theme recalls Comus, 43 45 : \r\r" I will tell you now \r\rWhat never yet was heard in tale or song, \rFrom old or modern bard, in hall or bower," \r\ri.e. "in prose or rhyme" (a phrase of Ariosto). Similar claims might \rbe instanced in Vergil, Spenser, and other poets, e.g. Horace\'s carmina \rnon prins \\ audita... canto (Od. III. i. 2 4). Dante says that he has seen \rin Paradise " things which whoso descendeth from up there hath nor \rknowledge nor power to retell," though he will try to (Paradise, i. 5, 6). \rrhyme, verse. \r\r17 26. Cf. the similar invocation of the Holy Spirit in P. K. I. \r8 17 : a higher power than the Muse addressed above. "There can \rbe little doubt that Milton believed himself to be, in some real sense, an \rinspired man " (Masson). In The Reason of Church Government \', n., \rhe says that a great poem can only be achieved through "devout prayer \rto that eternal Spirit, who can enrich with all utterance and knowledge " \r(P. W. ii. 481) ; and in The Christian Doctrine, I. 6, he explains that \rsometimes the Spirit means in Scripture " that impulse or voice of God \rby which the prophets were inspired" (P. W. iv. 152). \r\r19. for than know 1 st. Cf. Homer, Iliad II. 484, tffireTc v\\>v /uoi, \rMouacu... | v/xets yap 6eal tyre, irdpeffTt re, fore re Trdvra ; and Theo- \rcritus XXII. 116, etV 0ed, ffv yap olffda. \r\r20, 21. Cf. the account of the Creation in vn. 234, 235. In Genesis \ri. 2 the Heb. verb rendered "moved" in A.V. (ferebatur in the Vulgate) \rmeans either \'fluttered* (Luther has schwebete}, as in Deut. xxxii. n, \rwhere it is used of an eagle hovering ; or \' brooded \' (incubabat in Basil \rand others of the Latin Fathers), like a bird hatching eggs. Cf. Sir \rThomas Browne, Religio, xxxm., "This is that gentle heat that brooded \ron the waters, and in six days hatched the world." \r\r21. dove-like. The allusion, I believe, is to the descent of the \rHoly Ghost "in a bodily shape like a dove" (Luke iii. 22) ; cf. P. R. \r* 3O> 83. This may be inferred from The Christian Doctrine, I. 6. \r\r22, 23. -what in me is dark illumine ; the thought is expanded in \rin. 4055- \r\r24. argument, subject = Lat. argumentum; cf.

A. 293, 294: \r\r"Just are the ways of God, \rAnd justifiable to men " ; \r\r\r\rNOTES. 37 1 \r\rthe Scriptural reference being to passages like Ps. cxlv. 17 and Rev. \rxv. 3, "just and true are thy ways." Pope professed the same design ; \rcf. the Essay on Man, I. 15, 16 : \r\r"Laugh where we must, be candid where we can, \r\rBut vindicate the ways of God to man." \rSee also Gray\'s Progress of Poesy, 47. justify, i.e. " to men." \r\r29. grand, i.e. first, original. \r\r31, 32. i.e. transgress his will because of ("for") one restraint. \rKeightley makes for one restraint qualify what follows \'lords of the \rworld (cf. ix. 658), but for a single restraint.\' \r\r33. Cf. Iliad i. 8. \r\r36. what time, at the time when, Lat. quo tempore. " What time \rI am afraid, I will trust in thee," Psalm Ivi. 3.

Cf. 2 Pet. ii. 4, "if God spared not the \rangels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them \rinto chains of darkness" (see 72); also Jude 6, Rev. xx. i, i. See \rII. 169, 183, 196, III. 82. \r\r50. nine, traditionally a significant number, being a multiple of \rthree (see 619). Their fall from Heaven lasted nine days (vi. 871), as \rdid that of the Titans in Hesiod. Dante students will remember the \rgreat significance that is attached to the number nine in the Vita \rNuova. \r\r55. pain, physical suffering. Cf. 125, 147, 336 ; the point is \remphasised by Milton (and lost if we interpret pain=- \'punishment\'). \rLater, M. shows how the fallen angels first became sensible of pain \rthrough their sin (see vi. 327, note). \r\r56. baleful, full of woe. \r\r57. witnessed, showed, testified to. \r\r58. Scan obdiirate, as always in M. ; cf. VI. 790. \r\r59. The original editions have^f ngels kenn. Throughout the volume \rthe apostrophe indicative of the genitive was omitted (as often happened \rthen) : hence Angels may have stood also for Angel\'s or Angels\' (cf. 754). \rSome modern texts print Angel\'s ken, making ken a noun. But M. \ruses ken as a verb (v. 265, xi. 396), and I prefer to take it so here \r\r24-2 \r\r\r\r372 PARADISE LOST. BOOK I. \r\rwith the sense, \'as far as angels see.\' Cf. 2 Henry VL ill. ^. 101, \r" As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs." \r\r60. dismal \'; a much more poetic word then. \r\r61. "Of all the articles, of which the dreadful scenery of Milton\'s \rHell consists, Scripture furnished him only with a Lake of Fire and \rBrimstone" (Cowper). See n. 575, 576, note. \r\r63. no light, i.e. there was. It was a popular belief that the flames \rof Hell gave no light (Keightley). Cf. Herrick\'s Noble Numbers : \r"The fire of Hell this strange condition hath, \rTo burn, not shine (as learned Basil saith).\' 1 \r\rdarkness visible \\ an obvious oxymoron (see 692). What M. means is \rnot absolute darkness (\'pitch darkness,\' as we say), for then the \r"sights of woe" would have been invisible but the gloom which half \rconceals and half reveals objects, and itself (to borrow Pope\'s words) \r"strikes the sense no less than light." The Dnnciad, iv. i 4, is an apt \rparody. Mr Beeching reminds us of Job x. 22. \r\r66, 67.

He makes the distance of Hell from the Empyrean = three \rtimes the distance of the Earth ("the centre ") from the "utmost pole" \rof the globe or Universe (i.e. that point in the surface of the globe \rwhich is nearest to the Empyrean). The calculation is suggested by \rlliadvm. 16, &neid\\\\. 577 79. \r\r79 8 1. Beelzebub ; seen. 299, note. \r\r82. Satan = \' adversary \': a name first given to him when he \rrebelled: his "former name" being thenceforth heard no more (v. 658, \r659). It is not, I think, clear whether this "former name " was \' \' Lucifer " \r(cf. vn. 131 33), or some other title which, like the titles of the other \rrebels, was utterly blotted out (cf. 36163, vi. 37680). I believe, \rhowever, that M. means us to understand that both "Lucifer" and \r"Satan" were later names, given after the rebellion. \r\r84, 85.

Cf. v. 676 78, where Satan says to Beelzebub that \rthey had ever been wont to share each other\'s thought and "were \rone." To Beelzebub he first hinted his purpose to rebel (v. 673). \r\r\r\rNOTES. \r\r\r\r373 \r\r\r\r87. if he, i.e. if than beest he ; the sentence is not completed \r(auacohtthon}.

Cf. the account of the battle in m. 392, 393, vi. 83638. \r\r94. Satan\'s defiant spirit recalls the stubborn attitude of Prometheus \rtowards Zeus in ^Eschylus\'s play. \r\r97. fixed mind; cf. // Penseroso, 4, The Faerie Quecne, iv. 7. 16, \r"Yet nothing could my fixed mind remove" (change). \r\r98. high disdain. A common phrase with our old poets Spenser \r(The Faerie Queene, r. r. 19), Sylvester and others; taken from the \ralto sdegno of Italian writers (Todd). "High" is a favourite epithet \rof Dante, especially in abstract phrases like "the high virtue" (falta \rvirth], God\'s high decree " (alto fato di Dio], \' \' the high Providence " \r(falta Prowidenza]-, see the Inferno, xxm. 55, xxvi. 82, xxxi. no- \rPurgatono, xxvi. 72, xxx. 40, 142; Paradise, I. 106, xxvn. 61. \r\r104. dubious, because the battle lasted for three days (bk. vi.). \r\r105. shook his throne. A boastful exaggeration; cf. 114 and see \rvi. 833, 834. field, battle (u. 768); cf. Lat. campus. The Second Ed. \rhas the note of interrogation at the end of the line. \r\r107. study, pursuit of; like Lat. studium, it often meant \'en- \rdeavour,\' as in King Lear, I. i. 279; cf. xi. 577. \r\r10811. The Second Ed. has at the end of 108 a colon of 109 \ra note of interrogation ; and in 1 1 1 a full stop after me. This punctua- \rtion, variously altered in many texts, I retain. Some editors remove \rthe interrogation in 109, treating the line as a relative clause, as though \rSatan said : \'I retain my wilt (106), my hate (107), my courage (108), \rand all other qualities in me that cannot be overcome.\' This gives \rgood sense. But the interrogative form may, I think, be interpreted \rthus: \'to retain one\'s hate, one\'s courage etc., is not that to be still \runsubdued : in what else but this lies the test of being not over- \rcome?\' In one of the last of Tonson\'s editions (1738), I find line \r109 bracketed, i.e. treated as a parenthesis. \r\rwhat... else ; to be taken together ; cf. 683. \r\rno. Regarding 109 as parenthetical, I take that glory to refer \rback to 108 : never\' (says Satan) shall the Victor extort from me the \rjlorv to him of my submission.\' Some explain \'the glory (i.e. \rSatan s) of not being overcome\' ; but does this suit " extort " ? \r\r\r\r374 PARADISE LOST. BOOK I. \r\r115. Scan ignomy ; see II. 207, note. \r\r116. by fate; important because Satan denies (v. 860 63) that the \rangels were created by the Almighty: they were, he says, self-begotten \rby their own " quickening power," at the time decreed by the course of \rfate. Fate, not the Almighty, he recognises as superior. \r\rgods, divine beings ; cf. v. 60, note. \r\r117. Can the fiery substance (see u. 139 42, 274, 275, notes) \rof their forms perish (" fail ")? Satan thinks not: Moloch and Belial \rare less certain (ir. 99, 146 54). \r\r120. successful hope, hope of success; so in Shakespeare often. \rCf. "sterile curse" = the curse of sterility, Julius Ca-sar, \\. 2. 9. \r\r122. grand, great (like Fr. grand} ; cf. II. 507. \r\r123. triumphs\', Dryden always accents the verb triumph ; cf. The \rHind and the Panther, in. 566: \r\r"Who but the Swallow now triumphs alone? \r\rThe canopy of heaven is all her own." \rSee the Religio Laid, 56. \r\r124. tyranny. M. makes him use the most offensive word not \r"monarchy," as in 42, where the poet was speaking in his own person. \rSee u. 59, note. \r\r128. throned powers ; Satan\'s followers in general ("throned" cf. \r360 merely suggesting their dignity) : not the particular Order of the \rHierarchies called Thrones, since Satan is an Archangel. \r\r138. essences, beings. ) \r\r139. remains\', singular, because "mind and spirit" form one \ridea. This is a common usage in Shakespeare ; cf. Troilus and \rCressida, IV. 5. 170, "faith and troth... bids thee." See Lycidas, 7. \r\r141. though... glory extinct. Cf. 394, 395, and S.

The legends about both were conflicting. \rScan Briareos, though classically the name is Brtdreus. \r\ror Typhon. Cf. Fairfax, Tasso, II. 91, "He looked like huge Tiphoius \rloos\'d from hell." Typhon, or Typhoeus, is commonly described as \ra hundred-headed serpent-monster, who, trying to seize sovereignty \rover gods and men, was vanquished by Zeus with a thunderbolt and \rburied under ^itna. See II. 539. \r\r200. Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia ; M. alludes here to Pindar and \r./Eschylus who describe Typhon as living in "a Cilician den"; cf. \r/Eschylus, Prometheus Vinctus 351 54, rbv yrjyevi] re Kihucluv ot/ojropa | \rat>Tp<i)i\'...Tv<puva (\'the earth-born inhabitant of Cilician dens\'), where \r\rseems to be quoting Pindar, Pyth.

See \rOsgood\'s Classical Mythology in Milton, pp. 83, 84. \r\r201. The Bibles of that time identified the Leviathan with the \rwhale, and M. probably did so; but the Heb. livydthdn was used of \rany huge monster, e.g. the crocodile, Psalm Ixxiv. 14. \r\r202. ocean-stream ; Homer\'s poos (or Trorayuos) w/v\'tdvoio. \r\r203 208. Todd quotes a story to this effect from the Swedish \rwriter Olaus Magnus, whose History of the Northern Nations had been \rEnglished (1658). Evidently some remarkable \'traveller\'s tales\' as to \rthe size of whales were in circulation : Heylin, Cosmography (1682 ed.), \rtells us of \'Leviathans\' four acres big (in. 191, 192). Cf.

A reminiscence, I suppose, of A Midsummer- NighCs Dream, \rII. i. 243, "I\'ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell." Hartley \rColeridge says, "One sinful wish would make a hell of heaven." For \rthis conception of Hell as not a place, but a mental state, of punish- \rment, see IV. 20 23 ; also xii. 587, note. Sir Thomas Browne writes, \rReligio Medici, Li., "every devil is an hell unto himself; he holds \renough of torture in his own ubi" In Marlowe\'s Faust us, when the \rDoctor asks, "Where is the place that men call hell?", Mephistophilis \rreplies (v. 119, 120) : \r\r"Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed \rIn one self place ; for where we are is hell." \r\r257. all but less than = nearly equal to.

When William Lauder published in 1750 his infamous \rEssay on Milton, the object of which was to show that the poet had \rplagiarised from a number of obscure writers (mostly foreign scholars \rof the i6th and i7th cents.), he took these three lines, translated them \rinto what he conceived to be Iambic verse, said that he had found \rthem in the Adamtts Exul (1601) of Grotius, and printed them as a \rconvincing proof of Milton\'s dishonesty. His version runs or limps \rthus : nam, me judice, \\ regnare dignitm est ambilu, etsi in Tartaro ; \r| alto prceesse Tartaro siquidem (sic) juvat, \\ ctzlis quam in ipsis servi \robire mtinia. In 1752 he reprinted the Adamus in his Delecttis, but \rdid not venture to interpolate his forgery. The mischief, however, had \rbeen done ; for Bishop Newton printed the lines in his notes on this \rpassage as genuine, and remarked that M. had evidently \' translated \' \rthem from Grotius. Of course, the fraud was eventually exposed. \r\r\r\r378 PARADISE LOST. BOOK I. \r\rBishop Newton, whose own work in editing Paradise Lost was of \rsignal merit, had no reason to suspect Lauder, and probably no \ropportunity of consulting the Adamus. \r\r263. Probably the germ of this famous line (varied in VI. 183, 184) \ris Homer, Od. xi. 488, where Achilles (in Hades) says that he would \rrather serve on earth as a poor man\'s slave, than reign over all the dead. \rFletcher says of the fallen angels, "In Heaven they scorn\'d to serve, so \rnow in Hell they reign" ( The Purple Island \', vil. 10). \r\r266. oblivious, causing forgetfulness ; cf.

II. 813): abstract for concrete. \r\r288. optic glass ; apparently not an uncommon phrase for the tele- \rscope ; I find it in Giles Fletcher, Christ \'s Victory on Earth, 60, and \rin Henry More, Song of the Soul: \r\r"The Opticke glasse has shown to sight \rThe dissolution of these starrie crouds" \r\r(p. 212, Cambridge ed. 1647). Cf. "optic tube," in. 590 (borrowed \rby Thomson, Autumn}. Galileo did not invent the telescope, but he \rdeveloped it : hence it is generally associated with his name; cf. Bacon, \r"those glasses (ilia perspicilla} discovered by the memorable efforts of \rGalileo," Novum Organon, xxxix. \r\rA Tuscan by birth, Galileo (cf. v. 261 63, note) passed the latter \rpart of his life in, or near, Florence. M. saw him (1638 39); cf. the \rAreopagitica: "There (in Italy) it was that I found and visited the \rfamous Galileo, grown old, a prisoner to the Inquisition, for thinking \rin astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican licensers \rthought," P. W. II. 82. Another great Englishman who visited \rGalileo not long before M. (in 1636) was Hobbes. The poet would \rremember that, like himself, Galileo lost his sight (about 1638). See \ran article, " Galileo in the Val D\'Arno," in The Monthly Review, \rApril, 1907. \r\r289, 290. There is true pathos in the mention, here arid in 302 \r304, of Italian scenes. M. is revisiting in memory places associated \rwith what was, perhaps, the happiest period of his whole life, viz. his \rstay in Italy : "times when... I tasted bliss without alloy" (as he wrote \rin 1647, Letter). He always spoke of Italy with the deepest affection: \r\r\r\rNOTES. 379 \r\respecially of Florence which he loved for its language (Letter, 1638), \r"its genius and taste" (Second Defence), and the friends whom he should \rever remember with pleasure (vestri nunqiiam meminisse pigebit \rEpitaphium Damonis, 125). He was much courted there by men of \rletters, says his nephew (Life of M., 1694). \r\rFesole, Fiesole, classical Fcesulce; a hill about three miles north-east \rof Florence. Valdarno, the valley of the river Arno, in which Florence \rlies. Here (290) M. has in mind Galileo\'s last residence at the villa \rcalled // Gioello (\'the Gem\') at Arcetri, on the left bank of the Arno, \ri.e. west of the main part of the city. Near this villa "an old tower is \rstill pointed out as having once been his observatory" (Masson). There \ris a passage in one of Milton\'s Letters from Florence, in which he speaks \rof his "visiting with delight the stream of the Arno, and the hills of \rF^esohe" (P. W. 111.497). \r\r292. 293. his spear. ..the mast. I find the comparison twice in \rFairfax\'s famous translation (1600) of Tasso\'s epic Jerusalem Delivered \r(briefly referred to in these Notes as "Fairfax, Tasso"); cf. in. 17, \r"Mast-great the spear was which the gallant bore," and VI. 39. \r\r293. Norwegian hills. Norway, of course, was a great timber- \remporium : thence, says Hexham\'s Mercator (1636), "the high \rmasts for shipping, the plankes and boords of Oak and firre trees \rare sent yeerely in great abundance into Germanie, Holland, France, \rEngland, Spayne, and other places" (i. 93). And Jonson says that the \rappearance of the tall-masted vessels of the Armada was as if "half of \rNorway with her fir trees came," Prince Henry\'s Barriers. See also \rDryden, Annus Mirabilis, st. 143. \r\r294. ammiral, the chief vessel of a fleet, the flagship. \r296. marie, soil ; more correctly used of rich, moist earth. \rthose, i.e. the well-known, famous (Lat. illi). \r\r298.

The comparison of a multitude to fallen autumnal leaves is \rfound in Homer, Vergil, Dante, and other epic poets. Cf. Dryden \r(who has obviously recollected this passage), "Thick as the leaves in \rautumn strew the woods... the army stands," sEn. vi. 428. M. was \rhimself at Florence in the autumn (September, 1638). The Italian \rallusion in 302 304 follows naturally on the other (288 90). \r\r303, 304. Vallombrosa, \'shady valley\' ; about 18 miles from Florence. \rThe name is applied not only to the valley itself, but to the wood-covered \ramphitheatre of hills rising therefrom. High up stands a monastery (now \rsecularised) where M. was said to have spent some days (a tradition of \rwhich Wordsworth makes effective use in his "At Vallombrosa"), and \r\r\r\r380 PARADISE LOST. BOOK I. \r\rin the chapel an organ used to be shown as that on which M. played. \rThe reference to the fallen leaves is appropriate, the approach to the \rmonastery being through forests of chestnut and beech trees, deciduous \rspecies. Dean Stanley wrote, "inasmuch as the whole mountain is \rfurrowed with streams, which gave to the place its original name of \rfiellacqna, the leaves constantly falling on these streams, and almost \rchoking their currents, give the exact picture" painted by M.: "an \rinstance" (he added) "of the tenacity of Milton\'s memory in retaining, \rthrough all the vicissitudes of civil war, age, and blindness, the precise \rrecollection of what he had seen in early youth " Notes and Queries, \rV. v. 306, XI. 488, 489. \r\rThere is a good description of Vallombrosa in a once popular book \rof travel, Eustace\'s Classical Tour through Italy, vol. in. chap. 2. \rHe says that the monastery was " at all times celebrated in the literary \rhistory of Italy" (Ariosto, for instance, mentioning it in terms of high \reulogy) ; so that Milton\'s reference is really a touch of his literary \rallusiveness, as well as an echo of happy personal experience. Eustace \ralso notes that the description in Paradise Lost, iv. 131 42, has been \rthought by some to be a recollection of the scenery at Vallombrosa. \r\rembower, form as it were bowers. \r\rsedge ; "in allusion to the Hebrew name of the Red Sea, Yam \rSfif, i.e. Sea of Sedge, on account of the quantity of sea-weed in it " \r(Keightley). As the angels are afloat on waves (of fire), the simile is \rin the highest degree appropriate. \r\r305. The rising of the constellation Orion (at midsummer) and his \rsetting (at the beginning of November) being attended with storms, the \rname became proverbial of rain and " fierce winds." Cf. AZneid \rI. 535, nimbosits Orion, IV. 52, aquosns Orion ; and Grotius, Adamus \rExnl illic procellis ttim idus Orion furit. So Marlowe, Fanslus, in. 2, \r"Orion\'s drizzling look"; and Hey wood\'s Hierarchic, "Orion... \rriseth in the winter season, disturbing both earth and sea with showres \rand tempests " (ed. 1635, p. 177). \r\rarmed; from JEneid III. 517, annatmnque aitro circumspicit \rOriona.

Late Greek writers (cf. the Xlth Oration of Isocrates) speak \r\r\r\r\r\r\rNOTES. 381 \r\rof an Egyptian kin^ Busiris, unknown to Homer and Hesiod, and not \rmentioned in Egyptian records. Some describe him as builder of \rThebes. Legend said that he was slain by Hercules an event depicted \roften on vases. Why M. identifies him with the Pharaoh who perished \rin the Red Sea, no one has ever explained. Some editors say that M. \rfollows Raleigh\'s History; but Raleigh expressly states that Busiris \rwas "the first oppressor of the Israelites" (p. 204), and that after two \rintervening reigns came "Cenchres drowned in the Red Sea" (p. 197, \r1621 ed.). Cf. again p. 218, "through which (i.e. Red Sea) Moses \rpast, and in which Pharaoh, otherwise called Cenchres, perished." \rEither M. follows some unknown authority, or he treats Busiris as \ra general title for the rulers of Egypt, like \'Pharaoh.\' \r\rMemphian Egyptian ; cf. 694. The same use occurs in Sylvester ; \rcf. "The Memphian Sages then, and subtill Priests," where the margin \rhas, "The Magicians of Egypt" (Grosart\'s ed., I. 187). He calls the \rEgyptians variously "Memphites," "Memphists," and " Memphians." \rMemphis was the ancient capital (before Thebes) of Egypt; founded \rby Menes (ist monarch of ist dynasty), and called Men nefer, \'the \rgood station,\' from its position at the apex of the Delta. \r\rchivalry, forces, as P.

In v. 642 55 he describes the angels \rsleeping in Heaven, "among the trees of life." \r\r330. One of the earliest allusions to Paradise Lost seems to occur \rin Marvell\'s Satires ("Britannia and Raleigh," 1673 or 1674) : "Awake, \rarise from thy long blest repose ! " (Aitken\'s ed., p. 82). \r\r33 5 . nor did they not, i.e. and they did Lat neque non. \r\r337. For "obey A?" (Fr. obeir a), cf.

Alluding to the invasions of Italy and the Roman empire \r\r*-by the Goths (as early as 248 A.D.); the Huns, notably under Attila, \r\rdefeated at Chalons-sur-Marne, 451; and the Vandals. Genseric, or \r\rGaiseric, the leader of the Vandals, crossed from Spain into Numidia, \r\r428, captured Carthage, 439, and built up an empire in Africa. \r\rObserve the effectiveness of the three similes whereby M. conveys \ran impression of the numbers of the angels. They are compared \rresting on the water, to fallen leaves (or floating sea-weed) : flying, to \ra cloud of locusts that "darkens" the land (Exodus x. 15): alighted, \rto a vast host that throngs a plain. Each aspect has its simile. \r\r353. Rhene, from Lat. Rhenns Rhine, and Danaw or Donau, the \rGerman form of Danube, were current forms in the ryth cent.; they are \rin Hexham\'s Mercator (1636) and Heylin\'s Cosmography (1682 ed.), \rperhaps the two most popular geographical works of the time. So \r"Rhenish wine "= Rhine wine, The Merchant of Venice^ I. 2. 104, \rHamlet, I. 4. 10. \r\r355. beneath, south of; alluding to the Vandals. \r\r356. every ... each. A favourite variation with Milton; cf. Coinus, \r19, "Of every salt flood and each ebbing stream," and 311, "I know \reach land and every alley green." Etymologically ever^y ever- \reach. \r\r361 75. Again in vi. 379, 380, he tells us that the original \rnames of the apostate angels were " Cancelled from Heaven and sacred \rmemory." How then is he to describe them? He must give them \rsome titles. So he adopts (see pp. 672 74) the view that they became \rthe gods of heathenism, oriental and classical, and here, by anticipa- \rtion, uses those "new names" (365) which later ages assigned to \rthem. \r\r363. Bentley thought that M. dictated Book\', cf. Rev. iii. 5. A \rpassage in The Christian Doctrine, I. 4, seems to make this probable : \r"mention is frequently made of those who are written among \rthe living and of the book of life, but never of the book of \rdeath." \r\r37 37 1 \' & ee Romans i. 23. \r\r372. religions, religious rites, full of pomp ; M. often expresses \rdislike of ceremony and ritual in worship (see xn. 534). \r\r376. who first, who last\', rLva irpurov, rlva 8\' tiffraTOv, Iliad V. \r703.

Moloch; god of the Sun regarded as a destroying power; "the \rabomination of the children of Ammon," i Kings xi. 7; worshipped \rwith human sacrifices, 2 Kings xxiii. 10, Ps. cvi. 37, 38. The name, \rbetter written \'Mokch,\' means \'King\' (cf. Amos v. 26, margin), \rand M. generally adds "King" (cf. n. 43, vi. 357). He comes \r"first" because "fiercest" (n. 44). With these lines, 39296, cf. \rthe Nativity Ode, 205 10, where Warton pointed out Milton\'s \rprobable obligation to Sandys. \r\r396. Sandys, whose Relation (1615) of his travels in Palestine was \rcertainly known to Milton (see again xn. 143, 144, note), gives, no \rdoubt, the picture of the idol handed down by Jewish tradition, and \rdescribes it as "of brasse, hauing the head of a Calfe, the rest of a \rkingly figure, with armes extended to receive the miserable sacrifice, \rseared to death with his burning embracements. For the Idol was \rhollow within, filled with fire. And least their lamentable shreeks \rshould sad the hearts of their parents, the Priests of Molech did deafe \rtheir eares with the continual clang of trumpets and timbrels," Relation, \rp. 1 86 (ed. 1637). This sacrifice of children by fire was due to the \rnotion that the fierce summer heat of the god would be allayed thereby \r(Sayce). \r\r396 99. Rabba, the capital of the Ammonites, " the city of waters" \r2 Sam. xii. 27: Argob, a district of the mountain range of Bashan\\ \rArnon, the boundary river between Moab and the Amorites: all E. \rof Jordan.

The valley of Hinnom, lying S. and S.W. of Jerusalem, \rskirted the southern part of Olivet. Having been the scene of rites \rpaid to Moloch, it was "defiled" (cf. 418) by Josiah (2 Kings xxiii. 10), \rand made the common refuse-place of Jerusalem. Previously it formed \rpart of the royal gardens. Sandys says, " We descended into the valley \rof Gehinnon, which divideth the Mount Sion from the Mountaine of \rOffence.. .This valley is but streight (i.e. narrow) ; heretofore most de- \rlightful, planted with groves, and watered with fountains," Relation, \rp. 1 86.

The collective name of all these manifestations of the god \rwas \'Baalim\' (plural).

Thammuz, \'sun of \rlife,\' is the Greek Adonis (the god of the solar year), and the story sym- \rbolises the alternation of summer and winter. The notion of his blood \rflowing again was due to the reddening of the waters of the river Adonis \r\r\r\rNOTES. 387 \r\rthrough the peculiar red mud brought down by spring torrents from the \rLebanon heights.

Of Isis, \r\'goddess of the earth,\' Herodotus says, "the statue of this goddess \rhas the form of a woman but with horns like a cow " (Rawlinson, n. 73). \rAnubis again was represented with a jackal\'s head, which the Greeks \rand Romans changed to that of a dog (cf. Plato, Gorg. 482 B and Vergil \rMn. viil. 698, latrator Anubis}. Orus (or fforus), \'path of the sun,\' \rwas their Sun-god. \r\rMilton seems to be fond of referring to Egyptian mythology, drawing \rmainly, it is said, on Plutarch\'s treatise of Isis and Osiris. Thus he \rintroduces the story of Isis and Osiris in his beautiful allegory of the \rdismemberment of Truth (Areopagitica) ; cf. also the bitter gibe at \rCharles I.\'s death-scene in Eikonoklastes, i ("that I should dare to tell \rabroad the secrets of their Egyptian Apis"), P.

Strictly, Belial was not the name of any god, but an abstract \rword meaning \'that which is without profit \' = worthlessness, wicked- \rness : hence generally found in phrases like \'son (or man) of Belial\' \r\r\r\rNOTES. 389 \r\r(501, 502). Cf. Dryden, Absalom and Achitophel, 597, 598 : \r" During his office treason was no crime, \r\rThe sons of Belial had a glorious time." \r\rIt has been treated so in the Bible sometimes, but more often \rincorrectly as a proper name. M. makes Belial a type of effeminacy \rand lust (cf. P. R. II. 150), and rightly does not limit his worship to any \rparticular place although, to gratify his own hostility to the Church \r(49396) and the court (497), he cannot refrain from indicating his \ropinion as to where Belial is most prevalent. Cf. P.

Thus in his first Elegy (45, 46) M. epitomises the chief \rthemes of Greek tragedy sett mceret Pdopeia domus, sen nobilis 111, \\ \raut luit incestos aula Creontis avos (Creon was king of Thebes). Here \rhe mentions only two of the cycles. By the "heroic race" that fought \rat Thebes he means (i) Polynices and his six companions whose exploit \ris told in ^Eschylus\'s play, Scptem contra Thebas\', (2) their descendants, \rthe Epigoni, who ten years later destroyed Thebes. The heroes of \rthe story of Ilium are those whom the Iliad presents to us. There \r"auxiliar gods" take part, some helping the Trojans, some the Greeks. \r\r579 81. Cf. Milton\'s own account of his youthful studies: "hear \rme out now, readers, that I may tell ye whither my younger feet \rwandered ; I betook me among those lofty fables and romances, which \rrecount in solemn cantos the deeds of knighthood," An Apology for Smec- \rtymnuus (P. W. in. 118). The interest of this reference to the legend \rof King Arthur is explained in the Introduction. M. discusses the story \rat some length in his History of Britain, and evidently had studied it \rclosely. It had appealed to Dante. These lines are the reference \rin the Introduction to Marmion, where Scott is speaking of King \rArthur : \r\r" The mightiest chiefs of British song \rScorn\'d not such legends to prolong: \rThey gleam through Spenser\'s elfin dream, \rAnd mix in Milton\'s heavenly theme." \r\r580. in fable; an allusion, suggests Keightley, in particular to \rGeoffrey of Monmouth, who gives one of our earliest versions (1140) \rof the Arthurian legend. No doubt M. is thinking of Geoffrey whom \rhe used extensively in his History; but there he often refers also to \rthe Breton monk Nennius and to Gildas, yet earlier authorities than \rGeoffrey likewise to William of Malmesbury.

Spirits, we have seen (428), can contract themselves. \r\rA passage like this brings before us one of the great difficulties \rinherent in the design of Paradise Lost, namely the representation of \rthe angels, good and evil. Milton (says Johnson) "saw that immateriality \rsupplied no images, and that he could not show angels acting but by \rinstruments of action [i.e. bodies] ; he therefore invested them with \rform and matter" notably in his account (bk. vi.) of the battle in \rHeaven. Yet sometimes they are viewed as "incorporeal Spirits" \r(789), and it is seemingly as a spirit that Satan enters the form of \rthe toad (iv. 800), and of the Serpent (ix. 85, 86, 187 90). There \ris in fact some inconsistency: "his infernal and celestial powers are \rsometimes pure spirit, and sometimes animated body" (Johnson). The \rdifficulty is really insuperable, but Milton purposely modifies its effect, \r\r\r\rNOTES. 399 \r\rparticularly in the case of the evil angels, by several passages ; see the \rnotes on i. 42329, v. 478, vi. 327. As regards the good angels, \rI suppose he would have argued that divine beings had the power to \rassume corporeal forms and to resume their incorporeal being; whereas \rthe evil angels, through sin, gradually lost their immateriality and were \rforced "to incarnate and imbrute" (ix. 166). \r\r780, 781. Pliny (Nat. History, vn. u. 26) placed the dwelling \rof the Pygmies (575) "beyond the source of the Ganges even in the \redge and skirts of the mountains." So Batman vppon Bartholome \r(1582 ed., p. 377), "Pigmei be little men of a cubite long... and they \rdwell in mountaines of Inde." \r\rthat, the well-known, whose name needs no mention. \r\r781. beyond the Indian mottnt; probably he means Imaus (cf. III. \r431), in classical writers (e.g. Pliny) the western chain of the Himalayas, \ri.e. between the Ganges and the Caspian. It should be noticed \rthat extra Imaum (i.e. east of or "beyond") and intra Imaum \r(i.e. west of) were phrases employed by map-makers of the i7th \rcentury to describe (with convenient vagueness) regions of Central \rAsia. Thus in Mercator\'s map of Tartary we have Scythia extra and \rScythia intra Imaum montem. Milton\'s readers might be reminded \rof this common distinction. \r\r78185. A reminiscence of A Midsummer-Nigh? s Dream, II. i. 28, \r29, 141 (a play constantly imitated by Milton). Cf. too, T/ie Rape of \rthe Lock, 31, "Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen."

His application of the ecclesiastical word \r"conclave" to the assembly of evil angels seems sarcastic: that being \rthe term specially applied to "the Meeting or Assembly of the \rCardinals for the Election [of the Pope], or for any important affair \rof the Church" (Blount). Cf. his contemptuous reference in Of \rReformation in England, i, to the "councils (i.e. of the Church) and \rconclaves that demolish one another " (P. W. n. 389), and the similar \r;e of "consistory," P. R. L 42 . See x. 313, note.

Ormus ; the ancient Armuza, a town situate on an island near \rthe mouth of the Persian Gulf; called Armous in Webb\'s Travels (1590) \rsee Arber\'s ed., p. 23.

Howell\'s Familiar Letters, " Ormus... the greatest \rMart in all the Orient for all sorts of jewels" (Jacobs\' ed. 1892, i. 157), \rand Marvell, Song of the Emigrants, "Jewels more rich than Ormus \rshows." The Elizabethan traveller Coryat (1611) compares it with \rVenice, "of which the inhabitants may as proudly vaunt as I have \rread the Persians have done of their Ormus, who say that if the \rworld were a ring, then should Ormus be the gem thereof. " Hexham \r(1636) calls it Ormus Emporium, and Heylyn says, \'* in regard of the \rsituation, it was one of the richest Empories in all the world ; the wealth \rof Persia and East-India being brought hither" (Cosmography, 1682 ed., \rIII. 143).

The form Ind (or Inde} is common in poets \rcf. Comus, 606.

Belial\', see I. 490, note. In the systems of the demonologists \rBelial holds high rank; Heywood (Hierarchic, 1635, p. 436) makes \rhim head of the fourth of the nine Orders into which the fallen angels \rwere divided (corresponding with the nine Heavenly Orders). In \rassigning to Belial the two qualities of personal beauty and per- \rsuasive speech M. has followed tradition. Cf. Scot\'s Discoverie of \rWitchcraft (1584), "This Beliall...taketh the form of a beautifull \rAngell, he speaketh faire" (xv. 2). htimane, polished, refined. \r\r113. manna, words sweet as manna, "the taste of [which] was \rlike wafers made wiih\'/iomy," Exod. xvi. 31. \r\r113, 114. Alluding, as Bentley noted, to the profession of the \rSophists TOV TjTTb) \\6yov KpeLrrfji Troieiv. The reproach was made \ragainst Socrates; cf. Plato, Apology 18 B, which probably alludes to the \rsatirical lines referring to Socrates in Aristophanes\' Clouds 112 15. \r\rBacon says : " So likewise we see that Anytus, the accuser of Socrates, \rlaid it as an article of charge and accusation against him, that he did... \rprofess a dangerous and pernicious science, which was, to make the \rworse matter seem the better, and to suppress truth by force of eloquence \rand speech" (The Advancement of Learning, I. 2. i). Cf. Milton\'s \rTetrachordon, " as was objected to Socrates by them who could not \rresist his efficacy, that he ever made the worst cause [i.e. \\6yos] \rseem the better," P. W. in.. 320. dash, confound, cast down. \r\r117. timorous and slothful ; as might be inferred (i. 490 503). \r\r119.

Hamlet, IV. 5. 213), and see 210, note. \r\r139 42. mould, substance, i.e. of the angels, whom Moloch \' \rwould assail with Hell-fire. Spiritual frames, M. has said (i. 117), \rare formed of an "empyreal substance," i.e. of pure fire; cf. Psalm \rciv. 4, " Who maketh his angels spirits ; his ministers a flaming fire." \rAnd this fire, argues Belial here and in 215, 216, will, through its \rgreater purity, prevail over (i.e. be insensible to) the " baser " fire \rof Hell. \r\r26 2 \r\r\r\r404 PARADISE LOST. BOOK II. \r\r143. flat, absolute, complete. Cf. King John, m. i. 298. \r\r146. Gray\'s editors trace to these lines the stanza (Elegy, 85 88) : \r"For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey \rThis pleasing anxious being e\'er resigned ? " etc. \r\r148. Cf. Wordsworth\'s lines on the statue of Newton at Trinity \rCollege (The Prelude, bk. in.). \r\r151. motion\', probably from Measure for Measure, III. i. 120 \rTodd). See 180, note. \r\r155 59. This thought that the evil angels must live, so that they \rmay suffer the more, is not peculiar to M. Thus Grotius (Adaimis \rExul) makes Satan say, mors tma... \\ mihi siimma voti est; nee, quod \rextremum est mails, \\ licet perire ; and Sir Thomas Browne, Religio \rMedici, I. li., has, "the devil, were it in his power, would do the like \r[viz. destroy himself] ; which being impossible, his miseries are endless, \rand he suffers most in that attribute... his immortality." He has the \rsame thought in his Christian Morals, n. xiii. (end). \r\r156. Ironical, belike, perhaps, no doubt ; only here in M., but \rmany times in Shakespeare; cf. Hamlet, in. 2. 305. impotence, lack \rof self-restraint ( = Lat. impotentid). \r\r159. cease, i.e. from war : \' why give up the struggle ? \' \r\r160. they who, Moloch: a courteously indirect reference, consonant \rwith Belial\'s " humane " character. \r\r162, 163. A very similar passage is P. R. in. 203 n. \r\r165. what when, i.e. how was it when what was our state? \rMany texts print a note of exclamation (not in the original editions) \rafter what, making the sentence an anacoluthon. Rhetorical questions \rare a favourite literary device, amain, with all speed, strook ; Milton\'s \rpreference for this form to struck is marked (Masson). \r\r1 66. afflicting; perhaps in the lit. sense of affligere; cf. I. 186. \r168, 169. See i. 50 53, 311 13. chained\', see I. 48. \r\r170.

His speech partly replies to \rMoloch (since he dismisses the notion of war altogether), partly carries \rBelial\'s counsel a step farther. The gist of what Belial said was \'let \rus temporize, stay here and trust to chance something may happen.\' \rMammon answers \'let us indeed stay here, but not idly look to the \rfuture : rather straightway set about founding a realm here to compensate \rfor what we have lost there.\' Belial, type of ease and sloth, stands, as \rit were, halfway between Moloch and Mammon. \r\rThis notion of a "realm" in Hell, the counterpart of that in \rHeaven, is of course purely traditional, not invented by M. Thus in \rthe old Faust-book (1587) Mephistophiles tells Faustus that Hell is \rdivided into ten kingdoms, under five rulers (Lucifer, Beelzebub, Belial, \rPhlegethon and Ascheroth). See Thorns\' English Prose Romances, \rin. 185, 186. \r\r231, 232. then. ..when, i.e. then only= \'never.\' A favourite phrase; \rcf. iv. 970, "Then, when I am thy captive, talk of chains." \r\r233. the strife, between Fate and Chance (cf. 907 10) ; or \rbetween the rebellious angels and the Almighty (less probable). \r\r2 34 2 35* the former, to unthrone the King of Heaven; the latter, \rto regain our lost rights, to hope, to hope for ; cf.

We may note the oxymorons in these lines (252 57). \r\r255 57. It was a favourite thought with Milton that many men \rwould rather have "Bondage with ease than strenuous liberty" (S. A. \r271): i.e. would sacrifice their freedom to save the trouble of main- \rtaining it. Sallust, his favourite historian (as M. writes in a Letter \rto Lord Henry de Bras), makes .dimilius Lepidus say accipite \rotium cum servitio ...mihi potior visa est periculosa libertas quiet o \rservitio. Aubrey (reflecting, no doubt, what he had heard from Milton\'s \rnephew Edward Phillips and others acquainted with the poet) says that \rMilton\'s intense "zeal to the liberty of mankind," and his republicanism, \rcame largely from his admiration of the Roman writers and Roman \rCommonwealth. Similarly Hobbes complained that at the Universities \ryoung men learnt from the classics to despise monarchy (see Marvell, \r" English Men of Letters Series," pp. n, 12). \r\r26367. Cf. Psalm xviii. n, 13; and xcvii. *, "Clouds and dark- \rness are round about him." \r\r27073.

All existing things were supposed to consist of four \relements or constituent parts fire, air, water, earth ; and in each \relement dwelt certain Spirits or daemons peculiar to it, ruling it, and \rpartaking of its nature. Cf. // Penseroso, 93, 94 : \r\r"And of those daemons that are found \rIn fire, air, flood, or under ground." \r\rThat these daemons were the fallen angels was a common view; see \rAppendix, pp. 67274. When M. makes Mammon say that their \r"torments" (i.e. Hell\'s fires) may become their "element," he clearly \ralludes to these beliefs. \r\r278. sensible, sense; adjective for noun. \r\r281. compose, adjust, i.e. adapt ourselves to. \r\r282. where; so the First Ed. ; the Second Ed. has were. \r\r284 90.

A. 405. \r\r292. field, battle. \r\r294. the sword of Michael, i.e. the "two-handed" sword, "from \rthe armoury of God" (vi. 251, 321), with which in the battle in \rHeaven Michael laid low the rebellious angels and disabled Satan \rhimself (vi. 320 30). Not mentioned in Daniel or Revelation. \r\r299, 300. In Scripture Beel-zebub = Baal-zebub, \'lord of flies,\' is \rthe Sun-god of the Philistines, i.e. a local manifestation of the great \rdeity Baal (see I. 422), his chief oracle being at Ekron, "where \ranswers seem to have been obtained from the hum and motions of \rflies" (Sayce). In P. L. he ranks next to Satan (see v. 671, note). \rPerhaps this notion that he was one of the chief of the infernal powers \rwas due to the rendering of Mat. xii. 24, where the title "prince of \rthe devils" is really applied to Beel-zebu/, \'lord of the heavenly \rheight \' (cf. the margin). \r\r301, 302. Scan aspect, as often in M. and Shakespeare ; cf. v. 733, \rVi. 450. Newton quotes 2 Henry VI. I. r. 75, \' Brave peers of England, \rpillars of the state." front, brow, Lat.frons; cf. Hamlet, in. 4. 56. \r\r306. Atlantean, worthy of Atlas, one of the Titans, who as a% \rpunishment for making war on Zeus was condemned to bear heaven on \rhis shoulders. Cf. Spenser, sonnet to Lord Burleigh : \r\r"As the wide compasse of the firmament \rOn Atlas mighty shoulders is upstayd." \r\r" The myth seems to have arisen from the idea that lofty mountains \rsupported the heaven" (Class. Diet.}. \r\r\r\r408 PARADISE LOST. BOOK II. \r\r309. thus he spake ; and what he says sweeps on one side the main \rarguments of the previous speakers. \'War,\' he urges, recognising \rtheir true position, \' with the Almighty (such as Moloch counsels), that \ris ridiculous : peace (such as Belial and Mammon dream of), that is not \rto be hoped for : suffer we must and shall, but suffering may be \rlightened by revenge and that of a subtler kind than Moloch pro- \rposes.\' The speech of each deity is carefully differentiated, and \rconsistent with his character. Similarly in the later books (v. VIIL, \rxi., xil.) the good angels Raphael and Michael are drawn on contrasting \rlines. But, in the main, the characters of the evil angels " are more \rdiversified" (Johnson). \r\r311, 312. these titles ; see I. 737. style, title, appellation; cf. \r2 Henry VI. I. 3. 51, 52: \r\r"Am I a queen in title and in style, \rAnd must be made a subject to a duke?" \r\r313. for so ; alluding to the applause which Mammon had (284). \r\r315.

In each \rcase there is an allusion to Psalm ii. 9, "Thou shalt break them \rwith a rod of iron" (cf. Rev. ii. 27). The distinction between \riron typifying hostility and gold typifying benevolence is part of the \rsymbolism in which M. delights. Cf. Lycidas, no, in, where St Peter \rbears "two massy keys" the golden admitting to Heaven, the iron \rexcluding. A rod of gold, \' the Rod of Equity, 3 is among the regalia \rof the English Crown. \r\rthose, his loyal subjects, the angels who had not rebelled with \rSatan. \r\r330. determined, made an end of us, i.e. crushed us.

Addison considered this ancient prophecy in heaven con- \rcerning the creation of man a wonderfully imaginative stroke : "Nothing \rcould shew more the dignity of the species, than this tradition which ran \rof them before their existence.

V \rDrayton had used the phrase "darkness palpable," and the Preface to \rthe A.V. speaks of "thick and palpable clouds of darkness." Without \rdoubt, the original of all these passages was Exod. x. 2 1 in the Vulgate \rtenebrce tarn densce ut palpari qiteant. (From Newton.)

See again in. 76. \r\r412. senteries ; so the original editions, and the metre requires \rthe form. Perhaps the form sentery was due to the notion that the \rword came from Fr. sentier, \'a path,\' Lat. semita ; it is thought to be \ra corruption of sentinel, stations =Lat. stationes, \'guards, pickets.\' \r\r413. had, would have. \r\r415. choice, care in selecting by vote some one to send. \r\r423. astonished, struck with dismay, prime, chief, Lat./riVw/. \r\r425. proffer, offer himself, volunteer. \r\r430. With this speech cf. P. R. I. 44 105. The scenes are \rsimilar. In each case Satan undertakes a design from which his \rfollowers shrink here against Mankind, there against Christ. And \rthere he reminds them how he alone faced the former danger, and \rargues that, having succeeded once, he will succeed again. \r\r432, 433. An echo of JEneid VI. 126 29, where the Sibyl tells \rtineas that the descent into Avernus is easy : \r\r"But to return, and view the cheerful skies, \r\rIn this the task and mighty labour lies" (Dryden). \rThe slow monosyllabic rhythm and the alliteration seem intended by \rMilton to suggest the laborious effort of ascent. \r\r434. convex, vault ( = Lat. convexuni)\', a poetical use; cf. vn. 266. \r\r438. the void profound^ Lucretius\' inane profundum.

Night, he means, is a mere vacuity (932). \r\r441. abortive, monstrous, because unnatural, i.e. born prematurely. \rHe speaks of the gulf as though it were some monstrosity, horrible \rthrough premature birth. Others says \'rendering abortive.\' \r\r448. moment, importance. Cf. " of great moment," Hamlet, in. \ri. 86 ; "of no moment," 3 Henry VI.

Cowper, " to deceive the time, not waste \r\r\r\rNOTES. 41 1 \r\rit." So Lat. decipere e.g. in Horace\'s dulci laborum decipitur sono \ris beguiled into forgetting his troubles (Od. n. 13. 38). \r465, 466. The abrupt form of the ending is significant. \r\r467. prevented, anticipated, forestalled. \r\r468. raised, encouraged ; agreeing with others. \r478. awful, full of awe, respect ; cf. Nat. Ode, 59. \r\r483 85. i.e. "Let not bad men set much store by those casual \racts of seeming nobleness to which glory or ambition may doubtless \rspur even the worst of them ; for neither have that other class of evil \rbeings... lost such virtue as this " (Masson). \r\r485. close, secret ; often in Shakespeare, varnished. . .with, speciously \rhidden by. \r\r488 95. This simile is typical of many in Milton : similes classical \rin manner, more like Vergil\'s than Shakespeare\'s. The peculiarity is \rthat he works the simile out, in all its bearings, into a picture complete \rin itself but rather detached from the context. Cf. I. 768 75. \r\r489. while the North-wind sleeps Homer\'s 6(f>p etfSflo-i /x&os Bopt\'ao \r(//. v. 524), "that wind generally... dispersing clouds" (Newton). See \rxi. 842, note. \r\r490, 491. element, sky. \r\r492. if chance, if it chances that; cf. Comus, 508, "How chance \rshe is not in your company ? " The verb-construction (e.g. how does it \rchance that?\') is influenced by the noun-phrase (\'by what chance?\'). \rSo in A Midsummer -Night \'s Dream, I. i. 129, "How chance the roses \rthere do fade so fast ? " \r\r497502. The Civil Wars in England ; the Thirty Years\' War in \rGermany (1618 48) ; the Civil War of the Fronde in France (1648 52). \r\r501. Dr Bradshaw notes that the phrase to levy war (see xi. 219), \rwhich Johnson censured, was a technical term found in legal documents \rand statutes. He cites from one of Barrow\'s Sermons (May 29, 1676), \r"those in the late times who, instead of praying for their sovereign,... \rdid raise tumults, and levy war against him."

Gradually the use of the term \r"Ethiopia" expanded with the progress of Portuguese geographical \rdiscovery westward, until it applied to the vast region stretching from \rocean to ocean. And the name " Ethiopia Sea" was transferred from \rthe sea washing its eastern shores, which had come to be known as the \r"Indian Ocean" (Mare Indicum), to the sea on its western side. \rThus in Hexham\'s Mercator, in the map of Africa, I find the name \rOceamis JEthiopicus given to the sea west of Africa what we call \rthe \'South Atlantic\'; and in the letterpress the terms "^Ethiopicke \rOcean," "./Ethiopicke Sea," are always used so. The same is the case \rin Heylin\'s map of Africa ; while speaking of the Atlantic, he says, \r"some parts hereof, which wash the Westerne Shores of (Ethiopia \rInferior, be called the (Ethiopick Ocean" (Cosmography, Lib. iv. 71). \rOne can scarce do else than conclude that for Milton\'s readers the \rtitle Ethiopian might more naturally have meant the South Atlantic \r(or western sea), not the Indian Ocean ( = Oceanus Orientalis in \rMercator}. \r\r641, 642.

The basis of the allegory of Sin and Death lies, appro- \rpriately, in Scripture: "Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth \rforth sin : and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death, "James i. 15. \rIn ix. 12 Death is called the "shadow" of Sin, and in the poem we never \rmeet with them apart. How far M. means us to read an allegorical \rmeaning into his description is hard to say. I doubt, e.g., whether the \r" yelling monsters " (795) should be regarded as typifying " the mental \rtorments that are the consequence of sin" (Keightley). To me they \rseem to be introduced without allegorical intent partly because they \rintensify the element of mere horror, partly for the sake of the literary \rparallel. On the other hand, the "mortal sting" is plainly symbolical ; \rcf. i Cor. xv. 56. \r\r650. the one. Milton\'s figure of Sin is own sister to Spenser\'s Error \r( The Faerie Queene, I. i. 14, 15) and Phineas Fletcher\'s Hamartia or Sin \r(The Purple Island, XII. 27 cf. also his Apollyonists, i. 10 et seq.}\\ \rtheir common origin being the classical accounts of Scylla, notably \rOvid\'s (Metamorphoses XIV.) and Vergil\'s (sEneid in. 424 et seq.). \rIt is therefore as a study in a familiar style, not as a fresh creation, \r\r\r\rNOTES. \r\r\r\r419 \r\r\r\rthat the picture should be viewed. So with his figure of Death. The \rsubject of his poem, in itself, supplied him with few characters. \r651, 652. So Hesiod describes Echidna, Thcogony 298. \rvoluminous ; perhaps with the literal sense \'in rolls or folds \' (Lat. \rvolumen, from volvere, 4 to roll\'); cf. Pope, Windsor Forest, "The silver \reel in shining volumes roll\'d." So in Dryden\'s Annus Mirabilis, st. 123. \r6 5456. cry, pack.

See Comus, 135. \r\rcalled, i.e. invoked to take part in rites ; cf. Macbeth, in. 5. 8 and \r34 ("Hark! I am call\'d "). \r\r664. infant blood; alluding to an ancient superstition. When the \rwitches in Jonson\'s Masque of Queens assemble and relate what they \rhave been doing, one says : " Under a cradle I did creep, By day ; and \rwhen the child was asleep, At night I sucked the breath " ; whereto the \rnext : " I had a dagger : what did I with that? Killed an infant." In \rthe footnote Jonson adds, "Their killing of infants is common... \rSprenger reports that a witch confessed to have killed above forty \rinfants... which she had offered to the devil"; and then he cites \rauthorities, e.g. Horace, Epod. V. Cf., perhaps, Macbeth, iv. i. 30. \r\rto dance-, like the witches in Macbeth ; cf. iv. i. 132, stage-direction, \r"The Witches dance, and then vanish, with Hecate." So Jonson \rmakes his witches, in the midst of their rites, fall "into a sudden \rmagical dance "commenting that this is in accordance with tradition \r(Masque of Queens\'). Upon the significance of the custom, see Tylor\'s \rPrimitive Culture, n. 133. \r\r665. Lapland \'was traditionally a home of witchcraft ; cf. Burton\'s \rAnatomy, i. ii. i, 2 ("Digression of Spirits"), The Comedy of Errors, iv. \r3. u, "Lapland sorcerers," and Hudibras, in. i. 113, u 4 . Heylyn \rcalls the Laplanders "great sorcerers" (Cosmography, n. 122). Their \rchief instrument of divination was an oval cylinder or drum figured with \rvarious designs, notably of the moon and heavenly bodies. See "Reg- \rnard\'s Journey to Lapland" (1681), which contains a full account of \rthe \' sorcerers \' and their incantations ; also the narrative of Leems \r\r272 \r\r\r\r420 PARADISE LOST. BOOK II. \r\r(1767), on the " Magic Arts of the Laplanders" (both in Pinkerton\'s \rVoyages, 1808, vol. I.)- \r\r665, 666. The belief that the moon (see I. 785, 786) and \rheavenly bodies are affected by magic is very old and widespread. \rCf. Pliny, Nat. Hist. II. xii. i, "As for the Moone, mortall men \rimagine that by Magicke sorcerie, and charms, she is inchaunted" \r(Philemon Holland\'s translation, 1601). See Vergil, EcL vin. 69, \r\r*-Ovid, Metamorphoses vn. 192 et seq., Horace, Epod. v. 45, 46. Mar- \rlowe\'s Doctor Faustus claims (ill. 38) that Mephistophilis must do \r\r"whatever Faustus shall command, \rBe it to make the moon drop from her sphere." \rSo in Fairfax, Tasso, IX. 15, " The moon and stars for fear of spirites \rwere fled," and xni. 9. \r\rlabouring; cf. Cowper (translating Milton\'s Italian sonnet to \rDiodati), " And from her sphere draw down the labouring moon." \rSo Lat. /adores = \'eclipse,\' laborare, \'to suffer eclipse.\' Cf. Vergil, \rGeorg. II. 478, defectus soils varies, lunaque labores, \r\r666. the other Shape. Joseph Warton thought that Milton owed \rthe "person of Death" to the 6dvaros of Euripides in the Alcestis ; \rcf. the Sonnet, " On his Deceased Wife." But Death as a personified \rfigure had been described by Spenser (F. Q. vn. 7. 46), and introduced \r(as Todd noted) in Morality and early Elizabethan plays. I daresay \rtoo that a similar allegorical presentment might be found in some \rpopular Book of Emblems, or in the famous wood-cuts, The Dance of \rDeath (1538). In any case we must remember that the tendency to \rpersonify (fostered by the very important influence ot the Morality- plays \rand, later, of the Masque) was a characteristic of early i7th century \rpoetry. Roughly it may be said that this allegorising habit came from \rthe Latin tendency to personify abstract words, the two great masters \rof it being Dante and Spenser. \r\r670. Cf. Homer\'s ipefufv VVKT\\ <?oiK<6s, Od. xi. 605 (Newton). \r\r672. The "dart" of Death, a symbol of the force by which humanity \ris laid low, is mentioned in XI. 491. \r\rwhat seemed.

The comparison of a warrior clad in armour to a comet \ris at least as old as the ALneid (x. 272, 273), and is finely em- \rployed by Tasso (n. 52). The vast scale of the simile here conveys a \rprofound impression of Satan\'s majesty. \r\r709. Ophiuchus, a constellation of the northern (cf. " arctic") hemi- \rsphere, consisting of some 80 stars and extending about forty degrees in \rlength : lit. \'the Serpent-holder,\' from Gk. o0ts, \'a snake\' and fyw, \rLat.

In this picture of Chaos, to be compared with Ovid\'s, Metamor- \rphoses I. 5 20, Milton labours (as Masson notes) to convey to the reader \ran impression of the utter confusion of the scene described: heaping image \ron image, idea on idea, by which the imagination may be baffled (e.g. \rin 892 94), and the mind bewildered with an insistent sense of the \rinconceivable. And the rhythm heightens the effect. It is to this part \rof P. L. that M. alludes in ill. 1521. \r\r891. "One would think the deep to be hoary," y^xli. 32. Perhaps \rsecrets = \' secret places,\' Lat. secreta, here and again in 972 (Newton). \r\r894 96. "All the ancient naturalists [i.e. men of science], philo- \rsophers, and poets held that Chaos was the first principle of all things ; \rand the poets particularly make Night a Goddess, and represent Night \ror darkness, and Chaos or confusion, as exercising uncontrolled dominion \rfrom the beginning" (Newton). But in personifying Chaos as a distinct \rdivinity Milton seems to have extended the classical conception. His \repithets referring to the antiquity of Night ("the ancestress of gods \rand men") are drawn from the classics. (See Osgood, s.v. "Chaos" \rand "Night.") Nature, the created Universe. \r\r898. The four "elements" are meant, Milton\'s terms for them \rbeing, I suppose, proverbial ; cf.

Satan\'s pause is artfully contrived so as to enable the \rpoet to describe Chaos without seeming to delay the narrative \r(Richardson). \r\r911. As Nature, i.e. the Universe, was born out of Chaos (= "this \rAbyss"), so may she at last fall back again into Chaos. He is varying \ran old thought, that all things proceed from Nature and, perishing, pass \rback into Nature. Cf. Borneo and Juliet, II. 3. 9, 10 : \r\r"The earth that\'s nature\'s mother is her tomb; \rWhat is her burying grave that is her womb " ; \rand Tennyson, Lucretius, "the womb and tomb of all, Great Nature" \r(from Lucretius V. 260, omniparens eadem rerum commune sepulcrum). \rThe idea occurs also in Shakespeare\'s 86th Sonnet. \r\r918, 919. i.e. standing looked, frith, channel, estuary, firth. \r\r921, 922.

The story runs, that the one-eyed \rArimaspi purloin it from the griffins" (Rawlinson) ; and IV. 13, 27, where \rhe speaks of "the gold-guarding (xpwo0i5Xa/ces) griffins." Pliny (Nat. \rHist. vil. 2) says that these Arimaspi live near the Scythians, "toward \rthe pole Arkticke," and that they "maintaine warre ordinarily about \rthe mettall mines of gold, especially with griffons, a kind of wild beasts \rthat flie, and use to fetch gold out of the veines of those mines : which \rsavage beasts strive as eagerly to keepe and hold those golden mines, as \rthe Arimaspians to disseize them thereof, and to get away the gold from \rthem" (Philemon Holland\'s translation, 1601, I. 154). See Lucan, \rPharsalia in. 280, vn. 756. \r\rThe legend, which Sir Thomas Browne places among his Vulgar \rErrors, in. xi., may have had some connection with the fact that gold \ris found in the Ural mountains near which the Arismaspi were thought \rto dwell. \r\r943. gryphon, a mythic monster, a sort of chimaera; "sum men seyn \rthat thei han the body upward as an eagle, and benethe as a lyoune.... \rBut a griffoun hathe the body more gret, and is more strong thanne \rviij. lyouns, and more gret and strongere than an c (i.e. 100) egles, \rsuche as we han amonges us" Sir John Mandeville, who knew a \rcountry where the "griffoun" was quite common.

This picture of the palace of Chaos is as conventional and \rclassical as that of Sin. Cf. the cave of Death, thronged with person- \rified Shapes of evil and disease (xi. 47793) ; or the abode of Murder \r\r\r\r426 PARADISE LOST. BOOK II. \r\rin Milton\'s Latin poem on the Gunpowder plot, /;/ Quintum Norembris, \r139 54. So Spenser describes the palace of Pluto: Payne and Strife \rat his side: Revenge, Treason, Hate hard by: Care guarding the door \r(The Faerie Queene, II. 7. 21 25). Such passages owe their similarity \rto their common origin, viz. Vergil\'s account of the realm of Pluto, \rJEneid vi. 273 81. Of 959 63 Pope has a most felicitous parody in \rThe Dunciad, iv. (ad fin.) \\ see also canto I. where he makes Dulness \rthe "Daughter of Chaos and eternal Night." Indeed, all Pope\'s bur- \rlesque of epic machinery and style, in The Rape of the Lock and The \rDunciad, derives, I think, more from Paradise Lost than from the \rclassics. The same Miltonic influence is strongly felt in Gray\'s satirical \rHymn to Ignorance, which starts, as his editors note, with a humorous \recho of P. L.

The name has \rbeen considered a corruption of d-rjjjuovpyus ; it is at least noticeable \rthat Demogorgon became the patron of alchemists. Thus Howell, \rin his Instructions for Forraine Travell, calls alchemists "devout \rNaturalists and Disciples of Demogorgon " (Arber\'s ed., p. 81). \r\r967.

At its eastern entrance, i.e. where it opens into the \rBlack Sea, stood two rocks, one on either side, the Symplegades, so \rcalled (from Gk. vvv + TrX^o-o-ew, \'to strike\'), because when a ship was \rpassing through they clashed together and crushed it. By the advice \rof the seer Phineus and the help of Hera, the Argonauts managed to \rpass, and thenceforth the rocks were fixed motionless. Juvenal calls \rthem concurrentia saxa (Sat. xv. 19), i.e. "justling." \r\r1019, 1020. Scylla (660) and Charybdis were two rocks, close \rtogether, in the Straits of Messina between Italy and Sicily. The \rcurrents or whirlpools were so strong that sailors seeking to avoid \rthe one rock were generally driven on the other : whence the proverbial \rline, from the Alexandreis of Philip Gaultier, incidis in Scyllam cupiens \rvitare Charybdim. Cf. Milton\'s pamphlet the Animadversions \', 4 : \r"you have rowed yourself fairly between the Scylla and Charybdis, \reither of impudence or nonsense," P. W. ill. 67. It is a very common \rpoetic allusion ; cf.

M. is fond of this use of \rliving, exactly = \' vivid.\' Cf. Dante\'s la viva luce of Paradise (xxill. 31, \rxxxi. 46), and vivo hime (xxxni. no). \r\r1051. golden chain; alluding to Homer\'s story of the golden chain \rof Zeus, suspended from Heaven, whereby he can draw up the gods, \rand the earth and sea, and the whole universe, though they cannot draw \rhim down (Iliad vili. 18 27). Cf. Chapman, Shadow of Night, "The \rgolden chain of Homer\'s high device." Plato (Theatetus 153 c) inter- \rprets it of the Sun. It is curious to note how poets apply the story. \rSpenser uses it of the chain of Ambition by which men strive to rise in \rthe world (The Faerie Quecne, II. 7. 46, 47). Dryden, in his character \rof "The Good Parson," says: \r\r"For, letting down the golden chain from high, \r\rHe drew his audience upward to the sky." \r\rMilton himself in his Latin piece De Spherarum Concentu says that \rHomer meant the golden chain as a symbol of the chain of connection \rand design that runs through the universe ; and Pope follows him \r(Essay on Man, I. 33, 34) : \r\r"Is the great chain that draws all to agree, \r\rAnd drawn supports, upheld by God or thee?" \r\rJonson (Masque of Hymen see his note) writes of marriage, "Such was \rthe golden chain let down from heaven"; and Tennyson of prayer \r(Morte D* Arthur] : \r\r"For so the whole round earth is every way \r\rBound by gold chains about the feet of God." \r\rAmong prose-references we may add Bacon, The Advancement of \rLearning, I. i. 3, and 11. vi. I ("that excellent and divine fable of the \rgolden chain"); Drummond of Hawthornden\'s Platonic discourse on \rDeath entitled A Cypress Grove (1623) see "The Muses\' Library" ed., \r\r\r\rNOTES. 429 \r\rII. 265 ; and Sir Thomas Browne : " There is a nearer way to heaven \rthan Homer\'s chain" (Religio Medici, i. xviii.). \r\r1052, 1053. i.e. the Universe, hung in space, looked in comparison \rwith the Empyrean as small as some minor star which being close to \rthe moon\'s superior light seems insignificant. Cf. Tennyson : \r\r"a candle in the sun \r\rIs all but smoke a star beside the moon \rIs all but lost" (Queen Mary, v. i). \r\r"This pendent world," as Newton notes, cannot mean the Earth, \rwhich Satan does not see till he has gained entrance through the outer \rsurface of the Universe (ill. 498 543). \r\rIn IV. 1000 M. uses a similar expression "the pendulous round \rEarth" in a different sense. There the Earth itself is meant, and \r"pendulous" expresses its relation ("self-balanced," VII. 242) to \rsurrounding space within the Universe, \r\r\r\rBOOK III. \r\rThe exordium (i 55), apart from its beauty of thought and diction, \rhas a twofold interest personal, in that it is touched with the pathos \rof Milton\'s resignation under his affliction of blindness ; artistic, in that \rit is a fitting prelude to a fresh development in the action of the poem. \rHitherto the scene has been the gloomy regions of Hell or Chaos : now \rour imagination is lifted to the Empyrean and the new-created Universe, \rstill in its primal splendour. The transition from darkness to light is \raptly marked by this celebrated introduction. \r\rLines i, 2 and 21 26 are (I believe) the first lines quoted from \rParadise Lost in any work by a writer contemporary with Milton. They \rare cited contemptuously in The Transproser Rehearsed, or the Fifth Act \rof Mr Bayes\'s Play, Oxford, 1673, by Richard Leigh of Queen\'s College \r(see Notes and Queries, IV. i. 456, 457) ; the title of which is an obvious \recho of MarvelFs controversy with Parker (see p. 366). \r\r1, 2. Either Light was subsequent to the Deity, as being the first \rthing created by Him, or Light existed from Eternity equally with \rHim. See yil. 243 52 (with notes). \r\rfi,rst-born\', cf. vn. 244, and S. A. 70, "Light, the prime work of \rGod, to me is extinct," and 83, "O first-created beam." \r\rIt has been well said that there is something peculiarly personal and \rsensitive in Milton\'s references to light. \r\r2, 3. i.e. or may I, without blame, call ("express") thee co-eternal \rwith the Deity? since \\ he gives his reasons (from Scripture) for \r\r\r\r430 PARADISE LOST. BOOK III. \r\rterming Light "co-eternal." Cf. i John i. 5, "God is light," and \ri Tim. vi. 16, "Who only hath immortality dwelling in the light \rwhich no man can approach unto." \r\r4. The passage in Thomson\'s Slimmer beginning, " How shall \rI then attempt to sing," is a typical example of the spell that Milton \rexercised over him and his contemporaries, especially in the sphere of \rblank verse. \r\r7. hear\'st thou rather, dost thou prefer to be called ? A classicism; \rcf. Gk. AcXtfeij\', Lat. audire, as in Horace\'s seu Jane libentius audis \r(Sat. II. vi. 20). So M. in his Lat. poems, e.g. in the Epitaphium \rDamonis, 209, sive ceqnior audis \\ Diodotus; also in his prose- works, \re.g. in Areopagitica, " what more national corruption, for which England \rhears ill abroad [/ca/cws KXrfet, male audif\\, than household gluttony?" \r(P. W. n. 73)- \r\r9 12. Genesis i. 3 5. wert\', an old preterite, cognate with was. \r\r10. invest, enwrap; Lat. investire. Cf. i. 208. \r\r12. won from the... infinite, formed out of the realm of Chaos. \r\rvoid, i.e. of form, not of matter. \r\r13 15. wing... flight. His favourite metaphor, "wing "(like penna) \rbeing a natural emblem of that which uplifts the poet\'s genius. Cf. 1.14. \r\r14. the Stygian pool, i.e. Hell. The phrase occurs in a cancelled \rline (early) of the Comus MS. Dante speaks of himself as having passed \r"from the deepest pool \\iiaW hifima lacuna\'} of the universe," i.e. \rfrom Inferno, up to Paradise (Paradiso, xxxni. 22 24). \r\rlong detained ; the action of books I. and II. (up to 927) being laid in \rHell. \r\r16. utter... darkness, of Hell, as always in M. (cf. I. 72, V. 614): \rmiddle darkness, of Chaos. M. means that in n. 629 1055 ^ e de- \rscribed the flight of Satan through Hell, and thence upward through \rChaos towards Heaven, utter, outer. \r\r17. i.e. with loftier strains than those of the Orphic Hymn to \rNight (one of the poems of unknown authorship attributed to the \rmythic Orpheus). M. says "other," implying \'greater,\' because he \rregarded himself as literally an inspired teacher perhaps in the same \rsense that the Hebrew prophets were inspired. See I. 17 26, note. \r\r19. the Heavenly Muse, Urania, the power whom he invokes \rat the beginning of the poem (i. 6). \r\r20, 21. An echo of sEneid VI. 126 29; cf.

He is still devoted to those ancient poets inspired by the \rMuses (note the plural here and contrast 19) who haunted the "hill" \rof Helicon, with its "clear springs" Aganippe and Hippocrene (where \rwas the famous "grove" of the Muses), and Parnassus with the famed \rCastalian fountain. \r\r29. So Vergil (Georg. II. 476) describes himself as serving the \rMuses, ingenti percuss^ls amore. \r\rsacred \'; in the general sense \'divine.\' \r\r29 32. But his love of the classics is exceeded by his love of \rScripture. "Sion hill" (i. 10), and "Siloa\'s brook\' 1 \'\' (i. n) and the \rbrook Kidron : these scenes and the literature associated with them \rthe Psalms of David and the works of the singers of Israel are dearest \rto him. See the closely similar lines in bk. i. (6 13). For Milton\'s \rpreference of sacred Hebrew poetry to classical, cf. P. R. iv. 346, 347, \rwhere he makes our Saviour say that the works of Greek poets \r"Will far be found unworthy to compare \r\rWith Sion\'s songs, to all true tastes excelling." \r\rAnd in The Reason of Church Government, n (Preface), he pronounces \r"those frequent songs throughout the law and prophets... over all the \rkinds of lyric poesy... incomparable," P. W. II. 479. \r\r32. nightly. Milton was best inspired at night or daybreak. This \ris clear from vu. 28 30 and IX. 21 24. Newton in his Life of M. \rsays that the poet\'s widow, "being asked... who the Muse was, replied \rit was God\'s grace, and the Holy Spirit that visited him nightly." \r(Cf. Shakespeare\'s famous 86th Sonnet!) Johnson refers to the statement \rin Richardson\'s Life of Milton (1734), that M. "would sometimes lie \rawake whole nights... and \'on a sudden his poetical faculty would \rrush upon him with an impetus^ and his daughter was immediately \rcalled to secure what came" (a similar story is told of Pope). \r\rnor sometimes forget, and constantly call to mind ; see v. 178, note. \r\r33. those other two, i.e. Thamyris and Maeonides, poets as well as \r"prophets" rather than Tiresias and Phineus, "prophets" alone. \requalled... in fate, i.e. blind. \r\r34. i.e. and would that I might be equal ; a parenthesis. \r\r$o\\ probably =Lat. sic introducing an imperative clause, i.e. as a \rformula of wishing; cf.

Thamyris ; according to Homer, Iliad II. 595 600, a Thracian \rbard, who, for boasting that he could surpass the Muses in song, was \rdeprived of his sight and of the power of singing.

BOOK III. \r\rMaonides, i.e. Homer; called Maonides, either as a son of Mtzon, \ror as a native of M&onia, the ancient name of Lydia. Hence he is \ralso called Mceonitts senex, and his poems the Mcconice chartce or \rMceonium carmen, Spenser calls the praise of Queen Elizabeth an \r"Argument worthy of Mseonian quill" (The Faerie Queene, n. 10. 3). \rPope ironically laments that he cannot do justice to the merits of \rGeorge II. (Satires, v. 394, 395) : \r\r"Oh! could I mount on the Maeonian wing, \r\rYour arms, your actions, your repose to singl" \r\rSee also the quotation from Wordsworth on p. 688. The tradition of \rHomer\'s blindness is mentioned as early as the Homeric Hymn to the \rDelian Apollo. \r\r36. 7zresias, the blind sooth-sayer of Thebes, famous through the \rCEdipus Rex of Sophocles and many other works down to Tennyson\'s \rTiresias. In De Idea Platonica, 25, 26, M. refers to him as "the Theban \rseer whose blindness proved his best illumination " ; so in the Second \rDefence (P. W. I. 236), where he is speaking of his own affliction. \r\rPhineus, another blind prophet, king of Salmydessus in Thrace ; \rbest known in connection with the Harpies (ALneid III. -211 13), from \rwhose torments two of the Argonauts freed him. In his second Letter \rto Leonard Philaras (Sept. 28, 1654) M. compares himself with Phineus, \rquoting the account of the prophet\'s blindness in the Argonautica of \rApollonius Rhodius. \r\rDante was another sufferer, though from weakness of sight not \rblindness, and seems to allude similarly to the fact in the Inferno, II. \r97 98, where the note in the "Temple" edition gives other references, \re.g. the Vita Nuova, XL. 27 34. \r\r38. numbers, verse, the wakeful bird, the nightingale, Milton\'s \rfavourite bird, if we may judge by his many references to it.

Cf. Lycidas, \r128, 129: \r\r" Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw \r\rDaily devours apace, and nothing said." \r\rThis elliptical idiom occurs in Milton\'s prose-works. Cf. the Animad- \rversions, 4 : "seeing the power of Thy grace is not passed away with the \rprimitive times, as fond and faithless men imagine, but Thy Kingdom is \rnow at hand, and Thou standing at the door" (P.

An allusion to the Visio \rBeatifica\\ see I. 684. Hooker, speaking of the three types of \r"angelical actions," says that the first is "most delectable love, \rarising from the visible apprehension of the purity, glory and beauty \rof God, invisible save only unto spirits that are pure," Ecclesiastical \rPolity, i. iv. i. Cf. M. in The Christian Doctrine, I. 33, "Perfect \rglorification [of the righteous] consists in eternal life and perfect \rhappiness, arising chiefly from the divine vision" Sir Thomas Browne \rhas a fine passage on the idea (Christian Morals, ill. xv.)> and so has \rDrummond (A Cypress Grove), giving it a Platonic colouring ( Works, \rII. 277, 278). \r\r62 64. "Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express \rimage of his person... sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on \rhigh," Hebrews i. 3. See 138 42, 384. \r\r69 76. The last lines of bk. II. described Satan reaching in his \rascent from Hell the upper regions of Chaos and making his way \rtowards the Empyrean, close to which he perceived the globe of this \rWorld hung in Chaos by that golden chain (n. 1051) which is fastened \rto the Empyrean. Now he has arrived at the "crystal battlements" \r(i. 742) that separate the Empyrean from Chaos, and is flying along \rthem of course, on the outside. Below him lies the globe of the \rWorld ; he prepares to swoop down to its surface ; by 422 he has \rdone so. \r\r70. the gulf , Chaos, " the main Abyss" (83). there, in Chaos. \r\r71. this side, i.e. the side nearest to the Empyrean. The realm of \rNight (personified) lies in Chaos, between Hell and the Empyrean. \rInto the upper regions of this realm penetrates the light reflected from \rthe battlements of the Empyrean, and forms a kind of half-light, "a \rglimmering dawn" (n. 1037) what M. calls (72) a "dun" atmosphere, \ri.e. brownish, dusky (like Dante\'s /\' aer bruno). See again 427 29. \r\r72. sudtimq = Lat. sublimis in its literal sense \'aloft\'; cf. \rII. 528. \r\r73. The alliteration may be meant to indicate Satan\'s exhaustion. \r\r75.

This Council in Heaven has been called a less dramatic \rcounterpart to the Council in Hell in book n. It is perhaps to some of \rthese speeches that Pope would have pointed for the justification of his \rfamous sneer ("To Augustus," 99 102, Imitations of Horace): \r" Milton\'s strong pinion now not Heaven can bound, \rNow serpent-like in prose he sweeps the ground ; \rIn quibbles angel and archangel join, \rAnd God the Father turns a School-divine." \r\rAddison showed, with more sympathy, the difficulty inherent in the \rsubject: the poet here "dares not give his imagination full play." \r82, 83. the chains.

Bentley thought that M. dictated /*//; cf. 102. \r\r106, 107. Cf. The Christian Doctrine, I. 4, "the acceptableness \rof duties done under a law of necessity is... annihilated altogether" \r(P. W. iv. 63). \r\r108. "When God gave him [Adam] reason, he gave him freedom \rto choose, for reason is but choosing," Areopagitica (P. W. n. 74). \rReason is speculative: will, practical in fact, the power of putting \rreason into action. It is by reason that we choose the right course, \rby will that we take it. Such seems Milton\'s meaning. \r\r129. the first sort, the fallen angels, suggestion, temptation; a \rcommon Elizabethan sense ; cf. IX. 90. \r\r135. ambrosial, delicious. \r\r136.

Perhaps the idea of the flower being transferred was suggested \rby the Rabbinical doctrine that after the Fall of Man "the Garden [of \rEden], with its contents, was removed to Heaven " (Keightley). \r\r357 358\' Alluding to the " pure river of water of life, clear as \rcrystal" (xxii. i), the "living fountains of waters" (vii. 17), mentioned \rin Revelation ; "on either side of the river was there the tree of life" \r(xxii. 2). \r\r359. Elysian, such as might grow in Elysium = \\n Vergil and other \rclassical writers the region in which dwelt the souls of the good. Cf. \rShelley, Prometheus, II. 2, " Elysian flowers, Nepenthe, Moly, Ama- \rranth." Milton\'s \' Heaven \' is, in the main, the \' Paradise \' described \rby the early apocalyptic writings of Christianity ; and in this \' Paradise\' \rflowers are a conspicuous feature. \r\ramber, clear, transparent as amber ; one of those literary epithets \r(cf. P. R. III. 288, Gray, Progress of Poesy, 69) due to the classics ; \rcf. Vergil\'s purior electro... amnis Georg. in. 522. \r\r362 64. \' Now the pavement was bright (" smiled ") with roses \rin garlands which the angels threw down thick.\' \r\r363. "And before the throne there was a sea of glass, like unto \rcrystal," Rev. iv. 6. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 439 \r\r364. impurpled, made brilliant. Cf. Lycidas, 141, "And purple \rall the ground with vernal flowers. " \r\rsmiled ; cf. the use of Lat. ridere * to be bright, gay with,\' e.g. as \ra field with flowers. \r\r368. symphony, harmonious strains; cf.

The construction is \' Invisible, except when \rthou shadest...and thy skirts appear.\' \r\r380. dark with excessive bright. Scientifically a fact ; as a figure \rof speech, an oxymoron (see IV. 314, note). Similar is V. 598, 599. \rCf. Drummond\'s Hymn of the Fairest Fair (apostrophising the \rTrinity) : \r\r"Incomprehensible by reachless height, \rAnd unperceived by excessive light." \r\rSpenser had had the same idea ; cf. An Hymne of Heavenly Beautie, \riiS, 119, 17679. \r\r381, 382. Cf. Isaiah vi. 2, "Above it stood the seraphims : each \rone had six wings ; with twain he covered his face" M. chooses the \rSeraphim as being the most lustrous, the "brightest" (667), of \rthe Heavenly Orders ; yet even they cannot bear the extreme radiance. \rSee Gray\'s lines on Milton, Appendix, p. 683. \r\r383. Cf. The Christian Doctrine, I. 5, "certain it is... that the \rSon existed in the beginning, under the name of the logos or Word [see \r170, note], and was the first of the whole creation" (P. W. IV. 80). \rThat chapter (" Of the Son of God ") reveals Milton\'s Arianism very \rclearly. \r\r389. Cf. vi. 704. \r\r391 99. Closely similar to the account of the battle in Heaven in \rwhich Satan and his host are overthrown by Messiah (vi. 831 92). \r\r392. Dominations ; the title (Gk. Kvpi6TijTes) of one of the Orders \rof Heavenly beings. \r\r395. frame, fabric ; a favourite word with M. ; cf. n. 924, v. \r\r154. \r\r398. thee only, since Messiah drove out the foe unaided (vi. 880). \r\r406. Supply than or but ; the main verb is offered (409). \r\r413, 414. my song... my harp. Probably the speaker is intended \rto be the chorus of angels, regarded as one individual (in accordance \rwith the constant practice of the Greek dramatists cf. the choruses of \rS. A.)\\ the reference to harp (cf. 365) makes this probable. But it \ris possible that M. himself is speaking. \r\r416. starry sphere, the starlit sky of this World ; so in V. 620. \r\r\r\r440 PARADISE LOST. BOOK III. \r\r418. opacous, gloomy, because hung in Chaos. \r\r419, 420. first convex, the Primum Mobile or tenth sphere, formed \rof solid matter (cf. " firm," 418), and serving as the outer shell of the \rWorld, and so dividing from Chaos the nine other spheres ( = "luminous \rinferior orbs ") which are inside. See Appendix, p. 666. \r\r422, 423. The Universe was so vast that its spherical shape was \ronly perceptible from a distance ; standing on its surface, Satan might \rhave supposed it to be a plain. Cf. II. 1047, 1048. \r\r429. glimmering; a favourite epithet of Tennyson; it suggests \rthe faint light of early morning (n. 1037, Nat. Ode, 75) and twilight \r(i. 182, II Penseroso, 27). The latter use is Gray\'s (Elegy, 5, "the \rglimmering landscape" recalling Macbeth, in. 3. 5). \r\r430. at large, freely, without restraint ; cf. I. 790. \r\r431 39. Upon the geography see Appendix, pp. 683, 684. The \relaborate form of the simile is very characteristic. Like Vergil, M. often \rworks a simile out in all its bearings. Here the comparison is very \rapposite ; the vulture = Satan ; the flocks = mankind, Satan\'s prey; the \rbarren plains = the "continent" where he alighted. Addison dwells \ron the peculiar grandeur of Milton\'s similes, which almost always \rconvey " some very great idea" "some glorious image or sentiment." \rDante\'s similes, much more numerous than Milton\'s, are less classical \rin form, and often drawn from homely subjects ; sometimes he is very \rminute in the details. \r\r432. snowy. The name Imaus is cognate with the Sanskrit \rhimavat, \' snowy,\' and survives in Himalaya, \' the region of cold.\' \r\r434. yeanling, newly born. \r\r435 436- Ganges or Hydaspes\\ both have their "springs" (i.e. \rsources) in the Himalayas. Drummond mentions the two rivers, as \rtypifying India or the East, in the same couplet of Forth Feasting. \rHydaspes was the classical name for the modern Jhelum. The form \rof the line is a favourite with M. ; cf. 36, and I. 469, " Of Abbana \rand Pharphar, lucid streams." \r\r438, 439- Newton quotes from Heylyn\'s Cosmography (the best \rknown English geographical work of the I7th century), "the country \r[China] is so plain [flat] and level, that they have carts and coaches driven \rwith sails" ; and I find in Jonson\'s News from the New World\'. " Herald. \rYes, but the coaches... go only with wind. Chronicler. Pretty! like \rChina waggons." The following is from Staunton\'s Embassy to China \r(1797), cited by Todd : " The custom mentioned by some old travellers, \rof the Chinese applying sails to carriages by land is still, in some \rdegree, retained. [He then quotes Milton\'s lines and continues :] \r\r\r\rNOTES. 441 \r\rThose cany waggons are small carts, or double barrows, of bamboo, \rwith one large wheel between them. When there is no wind to favour \rthe progress of such a cart, it is drawn by a man, who is regularly \rharnessed to it, while another keeps it steady from behind, besides \rassisting in pushing it forward. The sail, when the wind is favourable, \rsaves the labour of the former of these two men. It consists only of a \rmat fixed between two poles rising from the opposite sides of the cart. \rThis simple contrivance can only be of use when the cart is intended to \rrun before the wind " (u. p. 76). \r\rThe plural Chineses was in regular use during the iyth cent. ; \rcf. the title of a work published in 1606, "An exact Discourse of the \rEast Indians as well as Chyneses and Jauans " (see New English Diet.). \r\r440. so ; Milton\'s constant manner of completing a simile. Cf. \rIV. 166, 192, 819. sea ; perhaps suggested by "sails" (439). \r\r444 97. The germ of the whole idea lies in Ariosto\'s Orlando \rFtirioso, canto 34, of which M. himself translates several lines in Of \rReformation (P. W. II. 383). The passage represents Astolfo, the \rEnglish knight, as being taken up in Elijah\'s chariot into the moon and \rled by St John \r\r" Into a goodly valley, where he sees \rA mighty mass of things strangely confus\'d, \rThings that on earth were lost, or were abus\'d." \rM. says that there is (as people thought) a Paradise of Fools (496), the \rrubbish-heap of the Universe : only it is situated, not in the moon \r(459), but on this outside of the globe where Satan is walking. And \rfrom the interior of the World it is approached thus (481 86) : vain \rthings and souls (448) mount upward from Earth past the ten spheres, \rreach the opening in the globe\'s surface, where the ladder leads up to \rHeaven (cf. 503 et seg.), and emerge on to the outside when, lo ! \r(486 89) cross-winds suddenly sweep them clean away from the ladder, \rand, whirled into space, they descend into their appointed Paradise, on \rthe backside (494) of the globe. \r\rThe almost burlesque satire of the passage seems scarce in keeping \rwith the dignity of an epic; it has too the demerit of improbability. \rProbably Milton\'s main purpose was to introduce the attack on the \rChurch of Rome, carefully placed at the end as a climax. Hardly less \rbitter, though less direct, are his assaults on the Church of England ; \rsee IV. 193, note. He could have pointed to the precedent of Dante\'s \rinvective against the Papacy, e.g. in the Purgalorio, xvi., and Paradise, \r\rXXVII. \r\rMilton\'s brother Christopher became a Roman Catholic; see \rHearne\'s Collections, Doble\'s ed., I. 288, 289, II. 63. \r\r\r\r442 PARADISE LOST. BOOK III. \r\rFor the Ariosto allusion see also Dryden\'s 2nd Prologue (1681) to \rthe University of Oxford, lines i 6. \r\r444. store, plenty. " Store is no sore " (an old proverb). \r\r449. fond, foolish ; so fondly \' foolishly \' in 470. \r\r451 54. Mainly a sarcasm against priestcraft. M., like Lucretius, \rdetested "superstition," classing it with "tyranny"; see n. 59, \rnote. \r\r456. abortive, born before their time, unkindly, unnaturally. \r\r457. in vain, at random, without purpose (Richardson). \r\r459. some, viz. Ariosto. Cf. Pope, The Rape of the Lock y v. 113, \r114, referring to Belinda\'s tress : \r\r" Some thought it mounted to the Lunar sphere, \rSince all things lost on Earth are treasur\'d there." \r\r460, 461. Apparently M. thought that the moon is inhabited ; \rcf. viii. 140 58. translated saints, e.g. Enoch (Gen. v. 24), Elijah \r(2 Kings ii.). middle ; explained in the next line. \r\r463 65. He means the "mighty men. ..men of renown," who \rwere born of the "sons of God " and " the daughters of men " (Gen. vi. \r4). In XI. 621 25 M. identifies the "sons of God" with the pious \rdescendants of Seth ; in v. 447 and P. /?. u. 178, 179 he regards them \ras angels. Gen. vi. 4 has been interpreted in both ways, Dryden may \rhave recollected these lines; cf. The Hind and the Panther, I. \r34144. \r\r466, 467. See the fuller reference to the building of Babel, XH. \r38 62. Sennaar=Shina.r (Gen. xi. 2). M. uses the Vulgate form of \rthe name ; the Septuagint has Sevadp. -^ \r\r469 71.

" He threw himself into the flames \rof Mount ^Etna, that by his sudden disappearance he might be believed \rto be a god; but. ..the volcano threw up one of his sandals and thus \rrevealed the manner of his death " (Classical Dictionary). \r\rsEtna ; this adjectival use of names (to avoid *s followed by s) is \rcommon in Shakespeare; cf. "Philippi fields," Julius Casar, v. 5. 19. \r\r471 73. Cleombrotus, a philosopher of Ambracia in Epirus ; \raccording to the legend, he drowned himself after reading Plato\'s \rdescription of Elysium in the Phado, in order that he might exchange \rthis life for a better, too long, i.e. to tell. \r\r474. embryos, beings in an immature, undeveloped state. He \ruses embryon for the adjective ; cf. n. 900, vii. 277. eremites = \rhermits ; from Gk. ^17^7175, \' a dweller in a desert \' (Gk. tp-qfJLla}. \r\rfriar=*Fr. frere (d.frere in Chaucer), the distinguishing title of the \rmendicant orders, of which, till the I5th century, there were four; cf. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 443 \r\rChaucer, Prologue, 210, " alle the ordres foure." M. mentions three, the \rfourth being the Augustinian hermits or Austin Friars. \r\r475. white, the Carmelites, so called after Mt Carmel, where the \rcrusader Berthold established the order, about 1156. They wear a \rwhite cloak. \r\rblack, the Dominicans, an order of preaching friars (Fratres Preedi- \rcantes) founded in 1215 by St Dominic, a Spaniard; cf. 479. A long \rblack mantle or cappa forms part of their dress. \r\rgrey, the Franciscans, founded in 1209 by St Francis of Assisi ; cf. \r480. They wear a grey gown of coarse cloth what M. in his In \rQuintum Novembris, 8r, 82, calls cineracea vestis, i.e. ash-coloured. \r\rFrom their respective garbs the three orders were known in England \ras the White Friars, the Black Friars, and the Grey Friars. \r\r476, 477. An allusion to the pilgrimages in the Middle Ages, \rto the tomb of Christ in the garden (John xix. 41) of the place \rGolgotha, where Christ was crucified. \r\r478 80. Alluding to the belief that even laymen, if they died in \rfriars\' robes ("weeds") would pass into Heaven (Masson). \r\r481 83. To understand these lines one must know something about \rthe Ptolemaic cosmology ; see Appendix, pp. 664 66. \r\rA close parallel is Donne\'s Progress of the Soul, in which he describes \rhow the soul ascends through the air, passes the planets (he names \rthem) one after another, and so reaches Heaven. \r\r481. the fixed, i.e. stars, set in the eighth sphere = Ccelum Stellatum. \rNote that \' stars,\' not \' sphere,\' is the word understood : the stars in this \rsphere are fixed, but the sphere itself revolves nay, is marked by the \rrapidity of its revolution (cf. V. 176, " orb that flies "). \r\r482, 483. i.e. that sphere which with its balance determines the \ramount of the swaying motion (" trepidation ") so much talked about. \rSee the notes on vin. 130 40. \r\rthat, the well-known, Lat. ille. Scan crystalline. \r\rtalked, talked of; this contemptuous word rather implies that M. \rdid not believe in the theory of the " trepidation." \r\rthat first moved, the Primum Mobile, or tenth sphere ; cf. The \rDeath of a Fair Infant, 39, "that high first-moving sphere." \r\r484, 485. Intended as a sneer (cf. the depreciatory word "wicket ") \rat the Roman Catholic doctrine of \' the power of the keys \' ; cf. Mat. \rxvi. 19, " And I will give unto thee [Peter] the keys of the kingdom \rof heaven." M. discusses the subject in The Christian Doctrine, I. 29. \rOther references to it in his works are Lycidas, 108 n ; In Quintum \rNovembris, 101 ; and Areopagitica,vfhere, ridiculing the Roman Catholic \rcensorship of publications and the Papal imprimatur \', he says: "as if \r\r\r\r444 PARADISE LOST.

Gen. xxviii. n 17. Probably Milton\'s notion of a stair \rconnecting the Universe with Heaven was suggested by Jacob\'s dream ; \rcf. the Paradiso, XX I. There is some verbal likeness (and possibly the \rsame Scriptural allusion) in a cancelled passage of Comus, after line \r\r215: \r\r"I see yee visibly & while I see yee \rthis dusky hollow is a paradise \r& heaven gates ore my head." \r\r516. mysteriously, i.e. had a mystic, allegorical meaning. \r\r517, 518. i.e. was drawn up and became "viewless" ( = unseen). \r518 22. He means the Crystalline sphere = the "wide Crystalline \r\rocean" (vn. 271), "the glassy sea" (vn. 619), which the angels \rbehold through the opening (cf. 526 28) in the surface of the Uni- \rverse as they stand at Heaven\'s gate and look down the stairs (vu. \r6!y j^). M. has already said that souls ascending Heavenward \rfrom Earth must pass this sphere (482). \r\r521. wafted, carried : like Lazarus (Luke xvi. 22). \r\r522. rapt, caught up: like Elijah (2 Kings ii. 11).

Paneas, the later Greek name of Dan, a little S. of Mount \rHermon, at the foot of which the Jordan has its chief source. \r\rThe form Beersaba, instead of \' Beer^eba,\' illustrates M.\'s avoidance \rof the sound sh in proper names; cf. I. 398, note. He often uses the \rSeptuagint or Vulgate form. The Septuagint has l$ijp<rap&, the Vulgate \rBersabee. \r\r540. on the lower stair, at the bottom of the stairs. \r\r541. scaled, ascended like a ladder (Lat. scala). \r\r546. obtains, attains to, reaches (obtinet). \r\r547. discovers, unfolds; Fr. decouvrir. \r\r549. Was M. recalling to memory one of the Italian cities visited \ron that tour in 1638 39 to which his thoughts reverted so gladly? \rPerhaps Florence on which he had looked down from Fiesole (see I. \r289, 290, notes); or, yet more likely, Rome. The epithet "glistering" \rsuggests an Italian scene. Cf. the famous description in P. R. of im- \rperial Rome and the "glittering spires" of the Palatine (iv. 54). \r\r551. To complete the sense, understand some words like "he (the \rscout) is seized with wonder " (Keightley). \r\r552. though after, i.e. although he was familiar with the splendours \rof Heaven. For the Latinism (post ccelwn visum) cf. I. 573. \r\r555 57- Standing at the topmost point of the globe, just at the \ropening, Satan can survey the whole interior of the Universe from E. \rto W.

BOOK III. \r\rNo poet, I think, conveys a sense of vast distance so acutely as does \rMilton, perhaps from his blindness, and these lines are a signal example \rof his gift ; excelling perhaps in the suggestion of sheer remoteness and \rspace even the simile of the ships (n. 636 43). \r\r562. first region, i.e. the uppermost of the three "regions" (a \rtechnical term) into which medkeval physicists supposed the air to be \rdivided; it was distinguished by the pure dry heat of its atmo- \rsphere. \r\r563. and winds. In his downward flight Satan has passed through \rtwo spheres, the Primum Mobile and Crystalline. Now he is in the \rCalum Stellatum, moving up and down (cf. "oblique way") among the \rhost of fixed stars (cf. 481). Till 573 we must picture him in this \rsphere. \r\r564. marble, lucid, bright as marble = marmoreus ; cf. Cymbeline, \rv. 4. 120, "the marble pavement," i.e. the sky, heavens. \r\r565. 566. i.e. that at a distance seemed to be stars. A Greek idiom. \r\r567. happy isles= those Islands of the Blessed, to which, according \rto an early Greek belief, favoured mortals passed without dying. Later \rthese Fortunate? Insulce came to be identified with islands off the west \rcoast of Africa (probably the Canaries). One of Ben Jonson\'s Masques \ris called "The Fortunate Isles." \r\r568. i.e. the gardens (cf. Comus, 981 83, P. X. II. 357) in which \rgrew the golden apples (iv. 250, Comus, 393 97) guarded by the \rdaughters of Hesperus and the dragon Ladon. The Hesperidum Insiila \rin which the gardens were commonly placed by writers have been \ridentified with the Cape de Verde islands (so perhaps by M. himself in \rvin. 631, 632). There is a hitherto unpublished poem, of some length, \ron The Hesperides by Tennyson, in his Life, and lines 981 83 of \rComus are prefixed to it as motto. \r\r571. above, more than not \'over,\' connoting place, since the \rsphere of the sun is below the sphere of the fixed stars ; in fact, being \rthe middle one of the spheres of the seven planets (cf.

Newton explains: up or down, north or south; by \rcentre or eccentric^ towards the centre, or from the centre...^ longitude, \reast or west (cf. IV. 539). Other editors note (i) that M. leaves it \rundetermined whether the sun (cf. vin. 122, 123) or the Earth is the \rcentre of the Universe, i.e. whether the Copernican or Ptolemaic \rastronomy is right: (2) that he makes longitude ts&\\. to west, and \rbreadth (561), i.e. latitude = nor\\h to south : a use which we just reverse. \r\r577. aloof, apart from; rare as preposition. \r\r\r\r\r\r\rNOTES. 447 \r\r580, 581. numbers, measures = Lat. numeri used of the measures \rof a dance.

Protean = \' shifting, changeable\'); but when he \rwas firmly seized, as by Menelaus (Odyssey IV. 454, 455) and Aristaeus \r(Georgic iv. 437 40), he would return to "his native form" and \rforetell the future. Milton uses this legend to illustrate the processes \rof alchemists : the matter on which they experiment is, like Proteus, \rtransformed by being drained through alembics ( = \' limbecs\') or stills, \rtill at last they restore it to its original ("native ") form. \r\rcall up. According to legend, no one had this power over \rProteus : he only issued from the sea of his own accord, at midday, \rto sleep on the shore. But, to emphasise the "powerful art" of the \ralchemists, M. suggests that they might even summon up Proteus at \rtheir will. \r\r606. here, in the sun : if the sun\'s heat can produce such marvellous \reffects on the far-off Earth (61 1), how much more on its own orb !

Dryden\'s editor in the Clarendon Press Series gives \rother references (p. 244).

In the chapter (l. 9) of The Christian Doctrine on angels, \rM. says, "Seven of these, in particular, are described [i.e. in Scripture] \ras traversing the earth in the execution of their ministry." They are \r"the seven angels which stood before God," Rev. viii. 2, "the seven \rSpirits which are before his throne," Rev. i. 4. Of these Uriel was \rone. He is mentioned four times in i Esdras, and in three places \r(iv. i, v. 20, x. 28) is called "Uriel the angel," but in the fourth (iv. 36) \r"Uriel the archangel." That he was "regent of the sun" (690) and \rdispenser of heat was a tradition, due probably to his name which \rsignifies \'the fire of God.\' Thus Heywood says that the four quarters \rof the world are assigned to the government of four angelic beings, and \r" The South, whence Auster comes, rules Uriel " (Hierarchic of the \rBlessed Angells, 1635 ed., p. 214).

M. refers to Aristotle\'s conception of a fifth element called \r"ether, "and he introduces the two main points of Aristotle\'s theory: \r(i) that "the ether fills the celestial spaces, and of it the spheres and \rstars are made" (cf. 718, 721); (2) that "the nature of the ether... \radapts it especially for circular motion " (cf. " orbicular," 718), \rwhereas the motion of the four elements is vertical, up and down. \rUeberweg, from whose summary of Aristotle\'s views the foregoing \rquotations are made, says, "Ether is the first element in rank \r[i.e. according to Aristotle]; but if we enumerate, beginning with the \relements directly known by the senses, it is the fifth, the subsequently \rso-called TT^TTTOV arQi-xeiov , quinta essential \r\rIt is disputed whether this "fifth essence" ought to be called an \relement, since it lacks the principle of contraries that belongs to the \rfour elements; and M. does not apply the title "element" to it. \rPractically he identifies the "fifth essence" or "ether" with Light \r(cf.

But there is also an allusion to Lat. triformis as an epithet \rof the moon indicating her threefold capacity as Luna, Diana and \rHecate; cf. Horace\'s diva triformis ; Od. in. 22. 4. So in Ben \rJonson\'s Masque of Queens the moon is addressed as "thou three- \rformed star... to whose triple name... we incline"; cf.

A., the influence is clear of Dante\'s famous words : \r" There is no greater pain than to recall a happy time in wretchedness," \rInferno, v. 121 23. It has been shown that Dante paraphrased the \rsentiment (an obvious one) from Boethius\' De Consolatione Philosophic, \rand that Chaucer (Troilus and Cresside) had anticipated Milton in \rimitating Dante; the latter being "the poet" of Tennyson\'s familiar \rcouplet in Locksley Hall : \r\r"This is truth the poet sings \r\rThat a sorrow\'s crown of sorrow is remembering happier things." \rSee also Sir Thomas Browne, Christian Morals , n. x.

In bk. V. when he is inciting the angels to rebel Satan pretends \rthat he and they are " self-begot, self-raised " (860), i.e. not created by \rthe Almighty and so not justly his servants; cf.

On the one hand, true gratitude is in itself payment : on \rthe other, a grateful man, though he may formally have discharged his \rdebt, still retains a sense of indebtedness to his benefactor.

Masson says: "Eden is the whole tract or \rdistrict of Western Asia [see 210 14] wherein the Creator has designed \rthat men should first dwell; Paradise is the Happy Garden [208 10] \rsituated in one particular spot of this Eden on its eastern side." Cf. \rGen. ii. 8, "God planted a garden eastward in Eden." Paradise^ \rGk. irapctSeuros, \'a park\'; a word of Persian origin. \r\r134. champain head, an open, level summit of open land. \r\rThe garden occupies a plateau or table-land, circular in shape (vin. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 455 \r\r304) and surrounded by a grassy mound or wall (143). On the inner \rside of this mound is a circling row of fruit trees ; their tops are visible \rfrom the outside. On the outer side of the mound the hill slopes steep \rdown, covered with shrubs and trees, the tops of which, though lofty, \rare below the level of the mound and so do riot obstruct Adam\'s view \rfrom it over the plain beneath. \r\rThis idea of setting the Garden on the summit of a hill is traced to \rEzekiel xxviii. 13, 14, "Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God... \rthou wast upon the holy mountain of God. " Dante and Ariosto had \rpreviously given the Garden a similar site (Keightley). \r\rThus when Adam meets and converses with Dante in Paradise, he \rsays that he was placed by God "in the uplifted Garden" (nelV eccelso \rgiardino) Paradise, xxvi. 109, no. See also the Purgatorio, xxvin., \rwhere Dante reaches and describes the Garden, which crowns the \rsummit of the Mount of Purgatory an obvious piece of symbolism. \rCollins has the allusion in the striking passage about Milton, in his Ode \ron the Poetical Character, 3. \r\r138, 139.

BOOK IV. \r\rDiodorus Siculus (in. 46) describes how in spring-time, when the \rwind is from the land, the fragrance of the myrrh and similar trees \rreaches the passing vessels, even far out to sea.

There is a similar allusion in V. 221 23 to the story of \rTobias and the evil spirit Asmodeus told in the Apocryphal Book of \rTobit. Tobias was sent on a journey by his father Tobit to fetch ten \rtalents of silver deposited with a friend in Media. The angel Raphael \rappeared to Tobias in human form, acted as his guide, and bade him \rmarry a Jewish maiden, Sara, who lived at Ecbatana in Media. Her \rseven husbands had been destroyed in succession by Asmodeus who \rwas in love with her. To escape their fate, Tobias was instructed by \rRaphael to burn the heart and liver of a fish, since the smell ("fishy \rfume ") would drive away the spirit. This he did after his betrothal to \rSara, and the plan succeeded: for Asmodeus "fled into the utmost \rparts of Egypt, and the angel bound him " (chap. viii.). \r\rCf. Reginald Scot, Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584), speaking of \rburnt incense as a charm against evil spirits : \' \' wheresoever the fume \ror smoke thereof shall come, everie kind and sort of devils may be \rdriven awaie, and expelled ; as they were at the incense of the liver of \rfish, which the archangel Raphael made" (bk. XV. chap. 18). Dante \rhas the allusion, calling Raphael "him who made Tobias sound again " \r(Paradiso, IV. 48). Sir Thomas Browne thought the story not quite \r" naturally made out" (Vulgar Errors, I. TO). \r\r168. Asmodeus^ one of the rebellious angels expelled from Heaven; \rcalled by M.

II. 150 52, and \r\r\r\rNOTES. 457 \r\rTennyson, St Simeon Slylites, 159, "Abaddon and Asmodeus caught \rat me." \r\r1 70. with a vengeance\', an intensive phrase, used here with a certain \rgrim humour=\'in all speed.\' Cf. Coriolanus, II. i. 6, "he\'s vengeance \rproud," i.e. intensely ; but there the use is more colloquial. \r\r172. savage, wild; cf. P. R. ill. 23, "savage wilderness." It is \rderived through the French from Lat. silvaticus, \'woody.\' \r\r176. perplexed, made difficult (or entangled). \r\r177. that passed, i.e. that might have passed. \r\r181. bound... bound. Cf. i. 642 (with the note). Here Satan\'s \rcontempt of the barrier is expressed. \r\r1 86. secure\', implying a false sense of security; cf. Lat. securus. \r\r192. Cf. the parable of \'the Good Shepherd ,\'/<?/&w x. \r\r193. One of Milton\'s prose-works was a treatise on "The Likeliest \rMeans to remove Hirelings out of the Church" (1659). It seemed to \rhim wrong that ministers of religion should receive salaries, and he was \rever ready to bring the charge of avarice and love of lucre against the \rclergy of the Church of England. Cf. xn. 507 1 1, and the denuncia- \rtion (appropriately assigned to Saint Peter cf. i Pet. v. 2) in Lycidas \rof the false, greedy shepherds who "Creep, and intrude, and climb \rinto the fold" (115). We must remember that he speaks as an enemy, \ra bitter enemy, of the English Church, lewd, base. \r\r194. the Tree of Life\', Genesis ii. 9. \r\r196. i.e. in the shape of a cormorant, chosen because a ravenous \rbird of prey (cf. III. 431) and thus symbolical of Satan himself; cf. \rRichard II. II. i. 38, Coriolamis, i. i. 125. As a sea-bird it does not \rseem very appropriate in Paradise ; but cf. Isaiah xxxiv. 1 1 (where, \rhowever, \'pelican\' is the correct rendering). \r\r198. virtue, efficacy; cf. 671 and see III. 586, note. \r\r199 201. well used. What use could Satan have made of the \rtree? He was already immortal. Perhaps M. means that if Satan had \reaten of the tree\'s fruit its saving power might have given him true life \ra regeneration of spirit that, leading to repentance, would have enabled \rhim to regain his true archangelic immortality. \r\r203. perverts\', the subject is he understood from " before \rhim." \r\r21014. According to these limits, which indicate, however, \ronly its eastern and western points, Eden lay in Syria and Mesopotamia \rmainly in the latter. \r\r211. Auran, or Hatiran, a district of Syria, about 50 miles S. of \rDamascus ; Gk. Avpaviris. Probably M. remembered that it is men- \rtioned in Ezck. xlvii. 16, 18, as an eastern bound of Palestine. \r\r\r\r458 PARADISE LOST. BOOK IV. \r\r212. Seleucia\', long the capital of Western Asia ; on the right bank \rof the Tigris, about 20 miles S.E. of the modern Bagdad ; sometimes \rcalled Seleucia ad Tigrin or Seleucia Babylonia. Here, and again in \rP.R. in. 291, M. terms it "great Seleucia" to distinguish it from other \rcities of the same name, such as the Seleucia near Antioch. It was \rbuilt by Seleucus, a Macedonian who became one of Alexander\'s \rgenerals, and about 312 B.C. founded the dynasty of the Seleucidce, \rkings of Syria (cf. "Grecian kings"). \r\r213, 214. A second description of the site of Eden: it was in that \rregion of Telassar (or Thelasar) where the "children of Eden" dwelt \r(2 Kings xix. 12, Isai. xxxvii. 12). They "appear from the Assyrian \rinscriptions to have inhabited the country on the east bank of the \rEuphrates, about the modern Balis. Here they had a city called \rBeth-Adina, which was taken by the Assyrians about B.C. 880 " \r(Speaker\'s Commentary). \r\r219. blooming, bearing luxuriantly. \r\r223. "And a river went out of Eden to water the garden," Gen. \rii. 10. In IX. 71 73 M. identifies this river with the Tigris. \r\r224. shaggy ; as a wood-covered hill appears, seen sideways ; \rsee VI. 645, note. \r\r22 5 35\' The river flowing through Eden reaches the hill on the \rlevel summit (cf. 134) of which is Paradise. Part of the river goes \rstraight through by a subterranean passage and issues in the plain \r(cf. 145) on the other side. But part of its water is drawn up through \rthe hill to the surface in the form of a fountain, the waters of which \rbecome rills. These rills irrigate Paradise and then, uniting into a \rwater-course, run down the "hairy side " (135) of the hill to join the rest \rof the river where it emerges from its underground channel. Then the \rwhole river divides into four great streams. \r\r233. See Genesis ii. 1014; c ^- Tennyson\'s Enid\'. \r\r"And never yet, since high in Paradise \rO\'er the four rivers the first roses blew, \rCame purer pleasure unto mortal kind \rThan lived thro\' her." \r\rDante pictures " Euphrates and Tigris welling up from one spring, and \rparting like friends that linger " (Purgatorio, xxxill. 11214). \r\r234. wandering ; transitive; cf. XI. 779. \r\r236, 237. The original texts have a comma after tell (236), not \rafter how in 237. Some modern texts reverse this punctuation; to the \rdetriment of the rhythm, I think. \r\rsapphire, sapphire-coloured, i.e. light blue, fount, source; cf. ill. \r535. crisped, rippling; often used of wind ruffling the surface of \r\r\r\r\r\r\rNOTES. 459 \r\rwater; cf. Byron, Childe Harold, IV. 211, "I would not their vile \rbreath should crisp the stream." See Comus, 984. \r\r239. error ; in the literal sense of Lat. error, \'a wandering.\' Cf. \rTennyson, Gareth, "The damsel\'s headlong error through the wood." \r\r241. nice, precise, fastidious. Supply some verb like \' set.\' \r\r242. curious knots, plots of ground laid out in a fanciful style. \rboon, bounteous (Lat. alma). \r\r246. imbrowned, darkened ; an imitation of the Italian use. \r\r246, 247. thus was, i.e. such was seat being in apposition to place. \rSome editors change the construction by removing the comma after \rplace, view, appearance, aspect. \r\r248. gums, i.e. aromatic resins like myrrh and balsam ( = balm], \rproduced by the balsam-tree (f3a\\<rafjt,6devdpov) and other trees of the \rsame genus. See 630, V. 23. wept\', cf. Othello, v. 2. 348 51. \r\r250. amiable, lovely; cf. "thy amiable cheeks," A Midsummer- \rNight\'s Dream, iv. 1.2; and Psalm Ixxxiv. i. \r\r250, 251. Hesperian... here only, "the stones told of the apples of \rthe Hesperides being true only of this place, if at all." It is an absolute \rclause in parenthesis. For the allusion see in. 568, and cf. the cancelled \rpassage (especially " fruits of golden rind ") at the beginning of Comus. \r\r252. lawns, glades, wide spaces clear of trees. \r\r255. irriguous, well-watered (Lat. irriguus). \r\r256. Thyer quotes Herrick, Noble Numbers : \r\r" Before man\'s fall the rose was born, \r\rSaint Ambrose says, without a thorn." \r\rOthers of the Church Fathers held the same fancy, which seems to have \rbeen applied also to the fabulous gardens of Adonis (see ix. 439, 440, \rnote) ; cf. Ben Jonson, Cynthia \'s Revels, v. 3. \r\rPart of the curse (Genesis iii. 18) was that the earth should bring \rforth thorns and thistles ; hence the presumption that there were no \rthorns before Adam\'s sin (Newton). \r\r258. mantling vine ; Comus, 294. \r\r264. apply, either \'practise\' or \'add.\' \r\r266 68. An allegorical way of saying, with classical imagery, \rsuch as he had used in his fifth Latin Elegy (In Adventum Verts}, that \rin Eden only one season was known, viz. spring (see x. 678, 679, \rnote), and that it was a time of universal luxuriance of growth and \rfreshness. M. might well have had in mind some picture seen in \rItaly, e.g. Botticelli\'s famous "Spring." Cf. too the allegorical dance \rof the Virtues in the Purgatorio, xxix. \r\rPan ; here regarded as the god of all nature, and called " universal " \rin allusion to his name (Gk. irav, \'all\'). \r\r\r\r460 PARADISE LOST. BOOK IV. \r\rGraces, Lat. Gratia, Gk. x < *-P lT *s > three goddesses (Euphrosyne, \rAglaia, Thalia) who personified the refinements and elevated joys of life. \r\rHour s> Lat. Horce, Gk. upon ; goddesses personifying the seasons of \rthe year; the course of the seasons was symbolically described as " the \rdance of the Hor& " (compare v. 394, 395). Classical writers often \rmention them along with the Graces. \r\rkd on; the metaphor of a dance; cf. Milton\'s Sonnet "To the \rNightingale," 4, " While the jolly hours lead on propitious May." So \rin Collins\'s Persian Eclogues, ill. 39, 40. \r\r268. Cf. Marvell\'s pretty lines on the Bermudas : \r"He gave us this eternal spring, \rWhich here enamels every thing." \r\r26887. He indicates the beauty of Paradise by saying that it \rsurpassed various spots celebrated for their charm. In describing \rNature, Milton "on most occasions calls learning to his assistance" \r(Johnson). \r\r26872. According to the classical legend, Proserpine was \rcarried off by Pluto = Dis (270), to the nether world, unknown to her \rmother Ceres, and became his wife. Latin poets (e.g. Ovid, Fasti IV. \r421 62) made Enna in Sicily the scene of the incident, the worship \rof Ceres having been introduced into Rome from Sicily. \r\rScan Proserpin, and cf. the Latin accent and form in ix. 396. \rLine 270 is echoed in ix. 432. Marvell in his poem Upon Appleton \rHouse says of his pupil in her garden : \r\r"she \rSeems with the flowers a flower to be." \r\r271. that, the well-known, Lat. ille\\ so in 272, 275. \r\r272, 273. " Near the city of Antioch, on the Orontes, lay a grove \rsacred to Apollo, in which was a temple of the god, whence he gave \roracles. It was named Daphne, and a spring which watered it was \rcalled the Castalian spring, after that at Delphi" (Keightley). \r\r27579- See Appendix, pp. 685, 686 ; and cf. P. R. n. 356. \r\r278. florid, ruddy, being the god of wine ; cf. Dryden, Alexander\'s \rFeast, 42, " Flushed with a purple grace " (said of Bacchus). \r\r280 85. Todd quotes Heylin : " the hill of Amara is a day\'s \rjourney high, on the top whereof are thirty-four palaces in which the \ryounger sons of the Emperor [i.e. of Abyssinia] are continually enclosed \rto avoid sedition ;... though not much distant from the Equator, if not \rplainly under it, yet [it is] blessed with such a temperate air that some \rhave taken (but mistaken\'] it for the place of Paradise" M. had clearly \rread this passage in Heylin, who seems to have been his chief authority \rin matters relating to the customs of foreign nations and geography. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 461 \r\rThe tradition with regard to the Abyssinian princes is used by \rJohnson in Rasselas, but he speaks of a single palace, and places it in \ra \' happy valley,\' not on the top of a mountain. \r\r280, 281. Abassin, Abyssinian ; the Arabic name. \r\rAmara ; correctly Amhara ; it is rather a range of hills than a \rsingle "mount." \r\r282. Ethiop line, the equator. Ethiop ; the people of Abyssinia \rstill call their land Utopia and themselves Itiopyavan. \r\r283. Shakespeare uses Nilus and Nile, head, source. \r\r288, 289. The repetition of " erect " is important, since M. treats \rman\'s stature as a symbol of his sovereignty over the " prone" beast- \rcreation, vn. 506 10. \r\rM. "drew the portrait of Adam not without regard to his own \rperson, of which he had no mean opinion" (Newton); and which he \rdescribes in the autobiographical part of his Second Defence of the People \rof England (P. W. I. 235, 236). \r\r291, 292. See Genesis i. 26, 27. \r\r295. whence ; it refers to " truth, wisdom, sanctitude " (i.e. holiness), \rthese qualities, not birth and position, conferring true authority. Cf. \rBurke, Reflections on the Revolution in France^ " There is no qualifica- \rtion for government, but virtue and wisdom, actual or presumptive" \r(Payne\'s ed. , p. 58). \r\r295 99. This relation of woman to man "not equal" runs \rthroughout the scenes in which Adam and Eve are introduced. Johnson \rsays, " Both before .and after the fall, the superiority of Adam is \rdiligently sustained" (Life of Milton). Such lines as these and 635 38 \rexpress Milton\'s personal conception of woman\'s status and capacities ; \rand how much it differed from modern views may be illustrated by \rthe single fact that his treatise On Education makes no reference to \rthe education of women. There is only a touch of exaggeration in \rJohnson\'s remark that Milton\'s works reveal "something like a Turkish \rcontempt of females as subordinate and inferior beings " ; the contrast, \rin fact, between Puritan austerity and the exaggerated chivalry of the \rCavaliers. See also ix. 823, note. \r\rGod in him ; modified by Bentley to "God and\\i\\m. n \r\r300. front, forehead (Lat. frons) ; often in Shakespeare. \r\r301. hyacinthine; a classical epithet. Homer speaks of hair \r(K-O/-KXS) \'like to a hyacinth* (uaKtvOivijj avQei 6/xofas), Odyssey VI. 231. \rA dark colour, perhaps deep brown, seems implied. Milton\'s own hair \rwas auburn ; the Bodleian Library has a lock of it, considered genuine. \r\r33 36- See i Cor. xi. 14 and 15 ("if a woman have long hair, it \ris a glory to her : for her hair is given her for a covering" in the margin, \r\r\r\r462 PARADISE LOST. BOOK IV. \r\rveil). Some think that M. was condemning as effeminate (cf. "but \rnot beneath " etc.) the Cavalier fashion for men to wear the hair long. \r\r-wanton, unrestrained; cf. 629 and Arcades, 46, 47. \r\r307, 308. implied subjection; M. infers this from i Cor. xi. 8 15. \r\r310,311. coy, modest. The slow rhythm suggests "delay." This \rline is the obvious original of Collins\'s line " Reluctant pride, and \ramorous faint consent " ( Verses written on a Paper, etc.}. \r\r313. dishonest, unchaste; cf. "honest" in the Prayer- Book. \r\r314. honour dishonourable, Cf. Tennyson\'s famous line, "His \rhonour rooted in dishonour stood " (Lancelot and Elaine). M. often uses \rthis classical figure of speech called oxymoron by which two words \rconnoting opposite ideas are closely associated. Cf. I. 63, n. 252. \rSee i Cor. xii. 23, 24. \r\r323, 324. A famous example of an idiom often used by Elizabethan, \ras it had been by Greek, writers. It combines the comparative and \rsuperlative constructions thus : \'Eve fair-^r than all her daughters\' + \r\'Eve fair-^tf of all women.\' So M. writes in Areopagitica, "this very \ropinion... is the worst and newest opinion of all others " (P. IV. II. 98) ; \rand Shakespeare in A Midsummer-Night\'s Dream, v. 250, " This is the \rgreatest error of all the rest. " Examples in Bacon occur in The Advance- \rment of Learning, i. 4. 8, and 5. n ; and Sir Thomas Browne has it in \ra curiously similar context ; cf. the Vulgar Errors, I. i, where he refers \rto Adam as (in the opinion of some) " the wisest of all men since." Its \rindependent existence in Greek and English proves that the idiom, \rthough illogical, is natural due perhaps to over-emphasis. It is just \rthe sort of combined construction into which people slip in conversation. \r\r329. recommend, make pleasant. \r\r332. compliant ; probably in the rare sense \'pliant, easily bent,\' \rdue to the false derivation from Fr. plier, Lat. plicare ; the true \retymological connection being with Ital. complire, Lat. complere. \r\r333. recline Lat. reclinis, \'reclining.\' \r\r334. damasked, variegated. \r337- purpose, conversation. \r\r340 47. Contrast x. 710 14 (note). \r\r343. ramped, sprang. \r\r344. ounce, a lynx (felis uncia); from Persian yuz, \'a panther.\' \r347. Note that the serpent is the most fully described (Newton). \r34-8 349. insinuating, winding himself into folds (Lat. sinus). \r\rGordian twine, intricate tangle, his braided train, his twisted, inter- \rlaced tail ; or perhaps the whole length of his body. \r\r" That intricate form into which he put himself was a sort of symbol \ror type of his fraud, though not then regarded" (Richardson). \r\r\r\rNOTES. 463 \r\r352. bedward ruminating\', chewing the cud (Lat. ruminantes} \rbefore they go to bed (Hume). \r\r354. the Ocean Isles, i.e. in the Atlantic, in which, according to the \rclassical fancy, the sun set ; cf. Comus, 95 97. In vin. 631, 632, M. \rseems to identify them with the Cape de Verde islands. \r\rascending scale ; to be taken, I think, not literally as a reference to \ran astronomical fact or theory, but merely as a metaphor for the \ralternations of day and night. \r\r355. Cf. Shakespeare, Sonnet 132, "Nor that full star that ushers in \rthe even." \r\r357. failed, that had failed him. The pause, indicating Satan\'s \r"dumb admiration," has enabled the poet to "enlarge (288 355) \rhis description " (Newton). \r\r360. mould\', in M. a constant word for \' material, substance.\' \r\r361, 362. " A little lower than the angels," Psalm viii. 5. \r368. ye ; often used in Elizabethan E. for the objective you. \r\r370. for so happy, considering how happy they are : their security \ris not in proportion to their happiness. Cf.for in 372. \r\r374. forlorn, defenceless, "ill secured" (370). \r\r381 83. An allusion to Isaiah xiv. 9. \r\r387. for him, instead of him ; or perhaps \'because of.\' \r\r389 91. * Public reason viz. honour and empire compels.\' \r\rpublic reason ; so in S. A. 865 70 Dalila excuses her treachery \rto Samson on the ground that "the public good" of her country \rrequired it. \r\r393, 394. necessity. Perhaps an allusion to Charles\'s plea for ship- \rmoney (Newton). Cromwell pleaded the same excuse for the execution \rof Charles. Dryden puts the plea ironically in the mouth of the \r"Panther" (in. 83538). In On Education M. sneers at those to \rwhom "tyrannous aphorisms appear... the highest points of wisdom" \r(P. W. in. 4 66). \r\r398. end, purpose, aim, viz. "to view"; cf. "end" in 442. \r\r402. a lion. Cf. i Peter v. 8. See I. 428, note. \r\r404. purlieu, the outskirt of a forest. \r\r405. couches; some modern texts misprint crouches. \r\r408. M. always uses the older form gripe, not grip ; cf. VI. 543. \r\r408 10. The construction is \'When Adam, by beginning to \raddress Eve, made Satan turn.\' Observe how naturally Satan gains \r(419 32) the information he requires (Newton). \r\r411. There is, I think, an almost quibbling use of sole(i) \'only,\' \r(2) \'unique\' (implying \'chief\'). Eve is the only sharer in Adam\'s joys \rand herself the chief element of them. \r\r\r\r464 PARADISE LOST. BOOK IV. \r\r419. See Acts xvii. 25. \r\r43 c. possess, occupy; cf.

Genesis ii. 23. head; " the head \rof the woman is the man," i Cor. xi. 3. \r\r447. odds, superiority ; often used so by Shakespeare ; cf. Richard \rII. in. 4. 89 ; Titus Andronicus, v. 2. 19. \r\r449, 450. In vin. 25355 Adam likens his creation to awaking. \rSo death is often likened to sleep. \r\r451. on flower s\\ so the First Ed.; the Second Ed. has of \rflowers. \r\r453 65. M. had in mind Ovid\'s story of Narcissus, Metamor- \rphoses in. 407 et seq. \r\r470. stays, i.e. for awaits. \r\r475. Cf. xi. 159.

"And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and \rflesh of my flesh : she shall be called Woman," Gen. ii. 23. \r\r486. individual, in the literal sense \' not to be divided ^insepar- \rable ; cf.

So Horace calls Maecenas mete partem animac t and \rVergil animte dimidinm mete (Odes n. 17. 5 ; i. 3. 8). \r\r493. unreproved, not to be reproved, blameless ; cf. 987. \r\r500. impregns, impregnates ; O. Fr. empreigner, Lat. impi\'cegnare. \rThe word occurs in More\'s Song of the Soul (Cambridge ed. , 1647, \rp. 205). \r\r503. envy\\ cf. ix. 264. \r\r506. imparadised \'; used by other writers of the I7th century. Cf. \rGiles Fletcher, Christ\'s Triumph after Death, 44, "in his burning \rthrone he sits emparadis\'d " ; and Phineas Fletcher, The Purple Island, \rI. 15. Dante has it in the Paradiso, xxvin. 3. \r\r511. pines ; probably transitive = \' makes me pine.\' Cf. xil. 77, \rand P. R. i. 325, "pined with hunger." \r\r526. equal with gods. See III. 206, note. \r\r530. a chance but, it is a chance, just a possibility, that chance \rmay lead, etc. : the grim sort of quibble in which bitterness (here \rjealousy) finds vent. \r\r539. in utmost longitude, in the farthest west. See III. 57476. \r\r540 43. The rays of the setting sun fell on the inner side of the \rtowering rock which formed the gate of Paradise on the east (xil. 638). \r\r549. Gabriel, \' man of God \' ; one of the seven great Spirits ; see \r\r\r\rNOTES. 465 \r\rin. 648, 649, note. Following, no doubt, some tradition, M. makes him \rin P. L. one of the chief warriors of the Heavenly host, though inferior \rto Michael (vi. 44 46). In the Bible Gabriel is always a peaceful \rintermediary between Heaven and Earth and the bearer of tidings to \rman (cf. Daniel viii., ix., Luke i.), and that is the ordinary conception \rof his office ; see the sketch of Adam unparadiz 1 d in the Introduction^ \rand cf. Fairfax, Tasso, I. n : \r\r" Out of the Hierarchies of angels sheen \rThe gentle Gabriel call\'d he [the Almighty] from the rest, \r\'Twixt God and souls of men that righteous been \rAmbassador is he, for ever blest; \rThe just commands of Heaven\'s Eternal King, \r\'Twixt skies and earth, he up and down doth bring." \rThat aspect of Gabriel is presented in P. R. i. 129, iv. 504. \r55i 54 Cf. a similar scene in 11. 528 32 (note). \r553- armoury, weapons; in apposition to "shields," etc. \r555. the even\', that part of the hemisphere where it was then \revening (Todd). \r\r557. thwarts, crosses. \r\r560. he thus began. This abruptness expresses his haste (Newton). \r\r561. When M. speaks of the offices assigned to the Heavenly \rbeings he seems to have in his mind the Temple-service of the Jews and \rthe distribution of the Levites "by lot," i Chronicles xxiii. xxv. Note \ralso the "courses" of service in i Chronicles xxvii., and cf. P. L. V. 655. \r\r565, 566. Cf. Satan\'s words in in. 667 76. \r\r567. God\'s latest image} the first being Christ; cf.

Cf. Silius Italicus VII. 154, 155, mediant somni cum buccina \rnoctem \\ divideret. So Lucan uses dividere horas, n. 689. Tennyson \rgives a fresh turn to the phrase ; cf.

To benefit mankind, Prometheus (\'fore-thought\') stole \r\rthe fire of Zeus (Jove) ; Zeus in revenge caused Hephaestus (Vulcan) \rto make a woman out of earth who should bring misery on mankind. \rShe was called Pandora or All-gifted (Gk. irdvTa, \'all\' + Swpa, \'gifts\') \rbecause each of the gods endowed her with some power fatal to \r\r30-2 \r\r\r\r468 PARADISE LOST. BOOK IV. \r\rmankind. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, conducted her to \rEpimetheus (\'after-thought\'), " the unwiser son"; and he, forgetting \rthe advice of his brother, Prometheus, not 10 accept anything from \rZeus, married her. Pandora brought with her from heaven a box \rcontaining all human ills and let them loose upon mankind. Thus \rZeus was revenged upon Prometheus, the benefactor of mankind. \rAnother version of the legend said that the box contained blessings, all \rwhich, save hope, escaped and abandoned the world when Pandora \ropened the lid. \r\rM. had made a precisely similar application of the story in his \rDoctrine and Discipline of Divorce, 3, calling Eve "a consummate and \rmost adorned Pandora" and Adam "our true Epimetheus" (P. VV. \rIII. 224). \r\r716 19.

Apparently M. identifies him with the Japhet of \rScripture. Cf. S.

In The Christian Doctrine, n. 4, M. says, "No \rparticular posture of the body in prayer was enjoined, even under \rthe law " (P. W. V. 34). He makes Adam and Eve sometimes stand \r(XI. i, 2), sometimes kneel (xi. 150), when they pray. \r\r722. The use of both with more than two things is quite Elizabethan ; \rcf. Venus and Adonis, 747, " Both favour, savour, hue and qualities." \r\r724 35. The words of adoration offered by Adam and Eve. \rM. may have had in mind Psalm Ixxiv. 16, 17. \r\r733. fill the Earth = \' replenish the earth," Genesis i. 28. \r\r735.

M. often shows his dislike of ceremonies and forms in \rworship ; cf. XH. 534, 535. \r\r741 62.

Lat. proprius, \'one\'s own.\' \r756. charities, feelings of love, affections (Lat. caritates). \r\r763. According to legend, "winged Cupid" (A Midsummer- Nigh? s \rDream, I. i. 235), the god of love, had two sorts of arrows, one tipped \rwith gold to inspire love, the other with lead to repel love (Ovid, \rMetamorphoses I. 468 71). Cf. the Glosse to Spenser\'s 77te Shepheards \rCalender, March, " He [Cupid] is sayd to have shafts, some leaden, \rsome golden." Orsino in Twelfth Night, I. i. 35, speaks of love\'s \r"rich golden shaft." The allusion is common in Elizabethan poets. \r\r764. constant lamp ; cf. XI. 590. The antithesis to " constant " \ris " casual " in 767. purple, lustrous. The imagery of the couplet \ris classical; cf. 708 13. \r\r767. court-amours. Probably M. is glancing particularly at the \rdissolute court of Charles II. Cf. a similar sarcasm in I. 497 ; also in \rP. R. n. 183. \r\r768. mixed dance. The Puritans greatly disliked the practice of \rmen and women dancing together. In Of Reformation in England, II., \rM. unites "gaming, wassailing, and mixed dancing\'" in one condemna- \rtion, P. W. n. 402. \r\rmask) a private form of theatrical entertainment, the forerunner of \rthe opera ; so called because originally the performers wore masks or \rvizards. The mask was much patronised by the court (especially under \rthe Stuarts) and great nobles from Elizabeth\'s reign up to the outbreak \rof the Civil War ; after the Restoration mask-performances were very \rrare, so that the allusion here had not very much point in 1667. \rM. was thinking of the past generation to which really he belonged. \rHe himself wrote a mask in Comus, 1634 ; but the Milton of Paradise \rLost, 1667, was a very different person. In the Preface to Eikonoklastes \rhe had ridiculed the "conceited portraiture... drawn out of the full \rmeasure of a masking scene," of Charles I. which was prefixed to Eikon \rBasilike\'y and in his pamphlet on A Free Commonwealth (1660) he had \rcondemned "masks and revels" as an appanage of court-life (P. IV. \rI. 312, II. 116). See the account of the mask appended to Comus. \r\r769. serenate, serenade, starved, perishing with cold; similarly \rused in II. 600. Cf. Horace\'s picture of a lover shivering by night \routside the house of his "proud fair" Lydia or Lyce {Odes i. 25 and \r\rIII. 10). \r\r773. repaired, made good the loss of, i.e. with fresh roses. \r775. know to know no more, are wise enough to seek no further \rknowledge. \r\r\r\r4JO PARADISE LOST. BOOK IV. \r\r77^ 777- "As the earth is a globe, her shadow, the sun being so \rmuch larger than she is, must form a cone, which moves as the sun \rmoves, and on the opposite side. Night and day then in Paradise \rconsisting each of twelve hours, the earth\'s cone would, at midnight, be \rin the meridian, and the half-way uphill to it [the meridian] would be \rtherefore nine o\'clock, the commencement of the second watch" \r(Keightley). \r\rsublunar vault, the expanse of heaven below the moon. The epi- \rthet helps to fix how far up the heaven the Earth\'s shadow had climbed: \rby nine o\'clock it had not got as far as the moon. \r\r778 80. M. always assigns to the Cherubim the duty of sentinels, \rfor the reason explained later (p. 68 1). \r\r778. port, gate (porta); cf. Coriolanus, v. 6. 6. \r\r782. Uzziely \'strength of God.\' The name occurs in the Bible \r(e.g. in Exod. vi. 18), but not as that of an angel, coast, skirt. \r\r784. as flame ; an apt simile, since the Cherubim are literally \rlustrous beings "radiant files" (797). \r\r785. M. has borrowed the Greek phrases <?TT\' dairiSa, \' on the shield \rside, i.e. to the left,\' and tirl 56pv, \'to the spear side, i.e. to the right.\' \rWe find Trap 1 davida and napa Sbpv used thus. The military terms \rsuit the context and lend dignity. \r\r786. from these, i.e. from the band of Chenibim which had \rwheeled "to the spear" and were to be under the command of \rGabriel himself. \r\r788. Ithuriel, \'the discovery of God.\' Zephon, \'a looking out.\' \rThe names suit the duty which Gabriel assigns to these two Cherubim. \r791. secure of , unsuspicious of, not fearing. \r79 2 > 793- i <e> there arrived one who (Lat. qui) tells (namely, Uriel). \r\r797. files, lines; cf. I. 567, "the armed files." \r\r798. these, Ithuriel and Zephon. \r\r799809. This episode is made the occasion of a philosophical \rexplanation of dreams in v. 100 21. \r\r800. Pope has an effective allusion to this line in the famous satire \ron \'Sporus\' (Lord Hervey), Epistle to Arbuthnot. See also S. A. 857, \r858, P. R. IV. 407409. \r\r802. Cf. The Merry Wives of Windsor, v. 5. 54, 55, "ere she \rsleep... Raise up the organs of her fantasy" ( = imagination). \r\r803. list; a past tense, as in n. 656. \r\r804. or if. M. varies the construction : \'trying to reach... trying if \rhe might \' etc. \r\r811. lightly, i.e. with only a light touch, for etc. \r\r812. temper, a thing tempered, i.e. a weapon : abstract for concrete. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 4/1 \r\r814.

Apparently M. uses think with different constructions, \rthus : \' Do not think thy shape the same, or suppose thy undiminished \rbrightness to be known as it was in Heaven,\' i.e. \'do not suppose thy \rbrightness to be undiminished and recognised.\' Some interpret : \' Do \rnot think thy shape the same or thy brightness undiminished, so as to \rbe known.\' \r\r840. obscure\', in the literal sense \'dark, gloomy\' (Lat. obscurus). \r\r843. these \\ Zephon points to Adam and Eve. \r\r845 47. Remembered by Dryden ; cf. The Hind and the Panther, \rill. 1040, 1041: \r\r"For vice, though frontless and of hardened face, \rIs daunted at the sight of awful grace." \r\rThere are parallels to this scene in Paradise Regained, where Satan, \rnot insensible to goodness, is abashed in the presence of the Saviour \r(e.g. in in. 145-49); \r\r847 49.

"Their port was more than human," Comus, \r297. \r\r870, 871. Gabriel, belonging to one of the highest of the Heavenly \rOrders, has known Satan (an archangel) in the past, and so recog- \rnises him here ; Zephon, an inferior angel, did not (830, 831). \r\r872. contest. M. always accents the noun, as we do the verb, con- \rttst; cf. xi. 800, "In sharp contest of battle found no aid." \r\r886. the esteem of wise, the reputation of being wise. \r\r891 93. whatever, any; cf. 587. to change... with, to exchange \rfor; compare the double use of Lat. mutare. \r\r894. dole\', Lat. dolor, \'pain.\' which. ..I sought, i.e. to do, viz. \r*to exchange torment for ease\' etc. \r\r896. object, urge as an objection to my breaking from Hell. \r\r899. durance, prison, strictly \'imprisonment.\' \r\rthus much, i.e. thus much in reply to your question. The style of \rthe speech reflects Satan\'s "contemptuous" bearing (885). \r\r906. returns ; probably the subject is "Satan," returns him being \rthe reflexive use so common in Elizabethan E. with many verbs now \rintransitive; cf. i Henry VI. ill. 3. 56. Some editors lake folly as the \rsubject, and return = \' bring back.\' \r\r911. however, howsoever, by any means. \r\r925, \'I do not come because I have less power to endure. 1 \r\r926, 927. Either (i) \'I withstood, resisted, thy fiercest attack\' cf. \rphrases like \'do thy worst\'; or (2) \'I proved myself ("stood") thy \rfiercest foe.\' The first way, which makes stood transitive, is preferable; \rfor the noun-use of thy fiercest > cf. n. 278, xi. 497. \r\r927, 928.

Here Satan is very like the Prometheus of ^Eschylus; \rcf. Prometheus Vinctus 937, 938 (Todd). \r\r949. Gabriel is replying to Satan\'s words in 930 33. \r\r953 56. In these lines Gabriel speaks to the host of Satan\'s \rfollowers, as though they were present ; your refers to them not, of \rcourse, to Satan, whom Gabriel addresses as thou. In Shakespeare thou \ris often a contemptuous form of address. \r\r958. patron, champion ; see III. 219, note. \r\r962. areed, advise. \r\r965 67. drag-, a vivid present, chained; see I. 48, ill. 82. seal\\ \rcf.

Cf. Fairfax, Tasso, xx. 22, "Like the new moon, \rhis host two horns did spread." phalanx, battalion (Gk. <d\\a7). \r\r980. with ported spears, i.e. "with their spears held in their hands \racross their breasts and slanting beyond the left shoulder, ready to be \rbrought down to the \' charge \' if necessary. The Angels have not the \rpoints of their spears turned to Satan [as the phrase used to be explained \rby editors] ; they have them only grasped in the position preparatory to \rturning them against him" (Masson). "Port" is really a military term. \rAnyone who has ever executed, or seen executed, the command "Arms \rport" (formerly "Port arms"), will be able to picture to himself the \rband of Cherubim with slanting spears thick as the slanting stalks of \rcorn a very appropriate simile, used by other poets ; Newton compares \rIliad u. 147. See VII. 321, 322. \r\r981 83. Ceres, corn; strictly the goddess of agriculture. The \rbeard is the prickles on the ears of corn, careful, anxious. \r\r984. hopeful, from which he had hoped so much ; or \'which had \rmade him so hopeful\' (the epithet being transferred). M. is thinking of \rVergil\'s expectata seges, Georg. I. 226. \r\r985. alarmed, prepared, on his guard. \r\r986. dilated, expanded.

See also VI. 306, 307. \r\r990. Cf. the picture of Death in II. 672, 673. The intentional \rvagueness of such descriptions is so effective because it stirs but does \rnot satisfy the imagination, rousing a sense of the mysterious and \rindescribable. \r\r992. cope, "canopy" (in. 556), roof; akin to cape, cap. Cf. Pericles, \riv. 6. 132, "the cheapest country under the cope," i.e. firmament. \r\r993. all the elements, the whole fabric of this Universe. \r\r994. wrack, destruction ; the old form of wreck. \r\r996 1004. The general idea of the "golden scales" of the Almighty \ris from Homer, Iliad vili. 69 72 : "then did the Father [i.e. Zeus] \rbalance his golden scales (xpv&eia raXavra) and put therein two fates of \rdeath. ..one for horse-taming Trojans, one for mail-clad Achaians; and \rhe took the scale-yard by the midst and lifted it, and the Achaians\' day \rof destiny sank down" (Leaf). The idea is repeated in //. xxn. 209 12, \rwith reference to the contest between Achilles and Hector, and imitated \rby Vergil, SEn. xil. 725 27, with reference to yEneas and Turaus. \r\rM. does not borrow without adding or varying, and we may note the \rfresh turns which he has given to Homer\'s notion: (i) he identifies the \rScales with the sign of the Zodiac called Libra\'\' the Balance\' a poetic \rfancy which gives at once a certain reality to the fiction of the Scales \rand a new association and interest to Libra itself; (2) he represents the \rScales as those with which the Almighty measured out the Universe \rand its elements and this, by adding to the importance of the Scales, \rheightens our sense of the greatness of Satan whose fate is weighed \rin them, and increases the grandeur of the whole scene. \r\rM. had referred to the Scales Fatorum lances in his Latin poem \rNaturam non Pati Senium, 34, 35.

Again M. varies the classical idea: (i) he does not \rweigh Satan against Gabriel, as Homer weighed the Greeks against \rthe Trojans, Hector against Achilles, or Vergil Turnus against tineas : \ronly Satan himself is weighed. The one weight represents the con- \rsequence (=" sequel") to Satan of fighting, the other the consequence \rof departing: the scale containing the weight that symbolises fighting \rshows, by its ascent, that Satan\'s chance of success is light weighed \rand found wanting {Daniel v. 27); i.e. that the result of departing \rwill be better for him.

Some scholars say that \rthe Homeric epithet for the Dawn, poSoSckruXo?, refers to her feet, \rnot hands; Milton, however, followed the ordinary interpretation \r(vi. 3). \r\r"Gray "and "rosy" (vi. 3) are, of course, traditional epithets for \rthe morning in its early and later stages, clime, region. \r\r2. sowed \\ the metaphor of scattering corn, to which the dew- \rdrops ("orient pearl") bear some resemblance.

No doubt, the garden of his father\'s house at Horton (cf. \r// Pen. 49, 50) was a haunt of the bird. \r\rhis ; poetic tradition (due to the classical story of Philomela) would \rsay her, but the male bird is the songster. Elsewhere, however, Milton \rfollows the poetic convention; cf. iv. 602, 603. Thomson, Spring, \rspeaks of the "love-taught song" of birds, remembering perhaps \rSpenser, Epithalamion, 88 ("love-learned song"). \r\r43, 44.

In The Christian \rDoctrine, I. 5, M. explains why he applies the word \' god \' to angels \r(P. IV. iv. 106). \r\r61. i.e. is it envy (cf. Satan\'s words in ix. 729, 730) or some \rreservation, restraint, that keeps you from being tasted ? \r\r66. vouched, made good with, confirmed by; cf.

The resemblance to Euripides, Alcestis 182, has been remarked. \rThere is a striking allusion to the Alcestis in Milton\'s Sonnet " On his \rDeceased Wife." Euripides was his favourite after Homer among \rthe Greek poets. A copy of Euripides with MS. notes by Milton is \rextant, and one of his textual emendations fjdtws for T)5eui> in the \rBacchfB 1 88 is universally adopted. In his edition of the Baccha \r(Cambridge Press) Dr Sandys points out several Euripidean remi- \rniscences in Comus. He notes too what seems to have escaped Milton\'s \reditors, viz. the fact that the year in which M. bought the copy of \rEuripides above referred to, and may reasonably be supposed to have \rdevoted some special attention to the works of the Greek poet, was the \ryear which saw the production at Ludlow, and probably the compo- \rsition, of Comus. The direct allusions to Euripides in Milton\'s prose- \rworks are very numerous. See the Appendix to Sonnets vin. and \rXXIIL, with the Notes on those Sonmts. \r\r77, 78. Cf. IX. 705 709. The allusion is to Genesis iii. 5. \r\r79. in the Air. Satan speaks as "prince of air" (xn. 454). In \rP. R. I. 3946 he addresses his followers as "ancient powers of air," \rand in P. R. u. 117, "the middle region of thick air" is their council- \rchamber. The idea can be traced to Ephesians ii. 2. Lines 78, 79 \rare the appropriate motto of Wordsworth\'s poem, " Devotional Incite- \rments." \r\r84 86. Cf. the scene of the Temptation in IX. 739 41.

For Milton "Fancy" is the loftiest form of imagina- \rtion ; cf. viii. 461, where he terms it " internal sight," i.e. the highest \rpower of conceiving mentally that which is not present to the eye. \rWe must remember what "Fancy" means to him when we read his \rline on Shakespeare in IS Allegro, "Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy\'s \rchild " (133)- " Fancy " is the normal i8th century word for \'imagina- \rtion.\' Cf. for instance, Collins\'s poems passim (e.g. the lines to Sir \rThomas Hanmer on his edition of Shakespeare). \r\rJohnson considered Adam\'s discourse on dreams to be too philo- \rsophical for a new-created being.

The hymn is obviously based upon Psalm cxlviii. and \rthe Canticle, " O all ye Works of the Lord."

He refers to the planet Venus, which, when west of the sun, \r\r\r\rNOTES. 481 \r\rrises and sets before him, and is called the Morning-star, Lucifer \rcf. the Gk. titles \'Ew<r06pos (\'dawn-bringer \') and 3>w<r0<5/>os (\'light- \rbringer\'); when the planet is east of the sun, it rises and sets after \rhim, and is called the Evening-star, Hesperus (iv. 605). Cf. \rTennyson, In Memoriam, CXXI. : \r\r"Sweet Hesper- Phosphor, double name, \rFor what is one, the first, the last." \r\rfairest of stars ; cf. Iliad XXII. 318, "EaTrepos, 6s KO\\\\I<TTOS fr o$pav$ \riVrarat dcrrijp, and the Glosse to The Shepheards Calender, December, \r" he seemeth to be one of the brightest of starres, and also first ryseth, \rand setteth last." \r\r171. Newton notes that Ovid (Metamorphoses iv. 728) calls the sun \rmundi oculus, and Pliny (Nat. Hist. n. 4) mundi animus. With \rElizabethan writers "eye of heaven" is a favourite periphrasis; cf. \rMarlowe, 2 Tamburlaine, iv. 3. 88, "A greater lamp than that bright \reye of heaven," and Shakespeare\'s Sonnets 18, 33. See note on \r// Penseroso, 141 ("Day\'s garish eye"). \r\r175. The general sense is that the moon, together with the fixed \rstars and the planets, is to resound his praise. \r\r176. the fixed stars ; cf. III. 481, note.

Drummond of Hawthornden, Forth Feasting \r(1617), where he is celebrating James I.\'s thirst for knowledge: \r\r"Thou sought\'st to know this. All\'s eternal source, \rOf everturning heavens the restless course, \rTheir fixed eyes [cf. 176], their lights which wand\'ring run, \rWhence moon her silver hath, his gold the sun." \rDrummond (1585 1649) ^ as not a ^ u ^ e * n common with Milton, and \rthe fact that his poems were issued in 1656 with a Preface by Milton\'s \rnephew Edward Phillips is suggestive. In his Theatrum Poetaritm \r(*675) Phillips deplores that they are " utterly disregarded and laid \raside at present," in spite of their "smooth and delightful" style. \rDrummond\'s lament for Prince Henry (1613) and his Pastoral Elegy \r(1637) may be compared with Lycidas. He is fond, too, of geographical \rnames, especially river-names like "Hydaspes" (ill. 436). And his \r"constant preoccupation with the starry heavens and the Ptolemaic \runiverse" makes another link with Paradise Lost. \r\rfive. He has already mentioned the Sun, Moon (then reckoned \rplanets) and Venus (166 70): hence only four planets remain \rP. L. 31 \r\r\r\r482 PARADISE LOST. BOOK V. \r\rMercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Possibly M. by a mere error \rsaidyfc* instead of four (which Bentley read); but I think that he \rintended to include Venus again. In 166-70 he addressed the planet \remphatically under its special aspect as the Morning-star, giving tft \rparticular manifestation of it an individuality apart from that of Venus \rconsidered generally as one of the seven planets. The Earth can \rscarcely be taken as making up the five, since not (as Masson notes) \rtill viii. 12830 does Adam learn that it may possibly be a planet. \r178. The metaphor in "dance" is Milton\'s favourite means o \rsuggesting the motions of stellar bodies ; cf. ill. 579. 580, and ix. 103. \rShakespeare also applies "dance" (the vb.) to the heavenly bodies- \rapparently to suggest their quivering light; cf. Much Ado About \rNothing, II. i. 349- Cf. too Shelley, " I sang of the dancing stars, \rHymn of Apollo. \r\rnot without ; Lat. tun sine. M. is fond of this classical turn of phrase \r(mtiosis); cf. III. 3 . He has it in his prose; cf. the fine passage \r(with its Horatian reminiscence) in the Areopagitica : "I cannot praise \ra fugitive and cloistered Virtue... that... slinks out of the race, where \rthat immortal garland is to be run for, not without dust and heat \r(P. W. ii. 68). \r\rwitf.Le. -the music of the spheres"; cf. 625-27. Perhaps the most \relaborate account of this idea in the classics is that given in the Myth \rEr, bk. X. of the Republic (617, 618). Plato there says that on each of tl \rspheres-he recognises eight-" stands a siren, who travels round with \rthe circle (i.e. revolution), uttering one note in one tone; and from al \rthe eight notes there results a single harmony." See Arcades, 61 73 \rwhere M. has adapted Plato\'s words (which are quoted at length in \rmy note there), and recalled Lorenzo\'s speech in The Merchant of \rVenice, v. 60-65; Comus, 241, 1021; Twelfth Night, HI. i. m, \rAntony and Cleopatra, v. 2. 84, As You Like It, II. 7- 6. \r\rAccording to tradition, Pythagoras was the only man who ever \rheard this music ; cf. Milton\'s treatise De Spherarum Concentu : "solus \rinter mortales concentum audisse fertur Pythagoras." Plato explains \rthat the music is inaudible because continuous; we should hear it \rthere were a break. M. (cf. The Merchant of Venice, v. 64, 65) ofters \relsewhere a purely moral view that sin has deadened the human senses, \ronce so keen. Cf. Arcades, 72, 73: \r\r"After the heavenly tune, which none can hear \r\rOf human mould with gross unpurged ear." \r\rHere, before the Fall, Adam and Eve possess the power which throu \rtheir sin humanity lost.

The name means \'divine healer,\' or \'health of \rGod.\' Raphael and Michael (who in bks. VI. and xi. is entrusted \rwith high duties by the Almighty) are archangels, and therefore \rintermediaries between Heaven and earth. Addison considered that \r"the angels are as much diversified in Milton, and distinguished by \rtheir proper parts, as the gods are in Homer or Virgil." See XI. 234, \r235, note. \r\r230. what, i.e. whatsoever, as often in M. \r\r238. secure ; it implies a false feeling of security. \r\r248. after his charge received\\ M. uses this Latin idiom often; \rsee I. 573. \r\r249.

Cf. the well-known passage in I. 28791. A similar \rbut indirect reference to Galileo occurs in in. 588 90. Galileo died \rin 1642 ; "glass of Galileo" is only a general term for the instrument \rassociated with his name. Cf. Pope, The Rape of the Lock, v. 137, 138 : \r\r\r\rNOTES. \r\r\r\r485 \r\r\r\r" This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies, \r\rWhen next he looks thro\' Galilaeo\'s eyes"; \r"this" being Belinda\'s lock, translated to the skies. \r\r264 66. He has just said that the earth, as it appeared from \rafar to the angel, resembled the regions in the moon as they appear \rto an astronomer ; now he compares it to the dim speck in the \rdistance which the pilot perceives when first he comes within sight \rof an island. Strictly, Delos (see X. 296, note) was, and Samos was \rnot, one of the circular group of islands in the yEgiean called Cyclades \r(from KIJK\\OS, \'a circle\'). \r\rThe lines as they stand in the First Ed. have no commas. Some \reditors place a comma before kens, making cloudy spot the accusative \rand taking Delos... appearing as an absolute construction. It seems to \rme preferable to make Delos or Samos the object after kens with cloudy \rspot in apposition. \r\r269, 270. The metaphor is that of separating grain from the chaff; \rcf. Isaiah, xxx. 24, " clean provender, which hath been winnowed with \rthe shovel and with the fan." Fan is from Lat. vannus, whence also \rvan = \'a. wing\' (n. 927). M. may have recollected Fairfax, Tasso, \rxvm. 49, "with nimble fan the yielding air she rent." winnows, \rparts, cleaves; cf. Thomson, Spring: \r\r"their self-taught wings \rWinnow the waving element" \r\r(i.e. the air). There is a similar use of the word in Tennyson\'s \rearly poem The Kraken. Fpr buxom = \' yielding, \' see the note on \rII. 842. \r\r27174. Cf. Fairfax, Tasso, xvn. 35, 36: \r" As when the new-born Phoenix doth begin \rTo fly to Ethiope-ward, at the fair bent \rOf her rich wings, strange plumes and feathers thin, \rHer crowns and chains, with native gold besprent, \rThe world amazed stands; and with her fly \rAn host of wond\'ring birds, that sing, and cry: \rSo past Armida, look\'t on, gaz\'d on so." \r\rA similar passage occurs in Dryden\'s lines to the Duchess of York in \rthe Preface to A turns Mirabilis. \r\rMost accounts describe the Phoenix as a solitary bird, living "in \rthe Arabian woods" (S. A. 1700) for 500 years (so say Herodotus and \rOvid, Metamorphoses xv. 395) ; at the end of that time (but Pliny \rwho also tells the story Nat. Hist. x. 2 gives the period as exactly \r509 years), "when hee (the bird) groweth old, and begins to decay, \rhe builds himselfe a nest with the twigs and branches of the Canell \r\r\r\r486 PARADISE LOST. BOOK V. \r\ror Cinamon, and Frankincense trees : and when hee hath filled it \rwith all sort of sweet aromaticall spices, yieldeth up his life thereupon \r...of his bones and marrow there breedeth at first as it were a little \rworme: which afterwards proveth to be a pretie bird" (Philemon \rHolland\'s Pliny, 1601, vol. I. p. 271). And the first thing that this \r"pretie bird" does is to collect the \'reliques\' of its former body (the \raforesaid " bones and marrow"), and carry them away to the temple of \rthe Sun at Heliopolis in Lower Egypt. M. however says at Thebes, \rmeaning the famous city of that name in Upper Egypt, which he calls \r" Egyptian" to distinguish it from the Boeotian town. Why he should \rprefer Thebes to Heliopolis does not appear ; probably he is following \rsome version of the legend and there are many which has not been \rtraced. There is a famous application of the myth in S. A. 16991 707. \r\r271. towering ; cf. xi. 185, note. \r\r272. gazed by all, i.e. gazed on ; it is often a transitive verb in M.; \rcf. vill. 258. What attracted the attention of the other birds was the \rplumage of the Phoenix his body caruletim fulgens (as M. writes in \rthe Epitaphium Damonis, 188), his tail white, his neck and head golden. \rCf. Spenser, Visions of Petrarch: \r\r" I saw. a Phoenix in the wood alone, \rWith purple wings, and crest of golden hewe ; \rStrange bird he was, whereby I thought anone, \rThat of some heavenly wight I had the vewe." \rThe splendour of Raphael\'s wings (also cerulean) caused him to be \rmistaken for a Phoenix. \r\rsole bird. Only one Phoenix lived at a time ; tinica semper avis, \rsays Ovid, Amores II. 6. 54, and M. imitates him in the Epitaphium \rDamonis, 187 (Phoenix, divina avis, unica terris). Cf. Lyly\'s Euphues, \r" as there is but one Phcenix in the world, so there is but one tree in \rArabia, wherein she buyldeth." \r\r276, 277. i.e. "he seemed again, what he really was, \'a seraph \rwinged\'; whereas in his flight he appeared, what he was not, a \rPhoenix" (Newton). \r\r277 85. A favourite passage with Tennyson. \r\r277, 278. Suggested, obviously, by Isaiah vi. 2 : "Above it stood \rthe seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, \rand with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly." M. has \rvaried this account in certain details, borrowing something from the \rdescription of the Cherubim in Ezekiel i. and x. lineaments, his limbs \rgenerally; not merely the features of his face. So in VII. 477. \r\r280. with regal ornament. This seems to show that the colour of \rthe first pair was- purple ; cf. XI. 241 44. So Gray {Hymn to \r\r\r\rNOTES. \r\rAdversity} speaks of "purple tyrants," i.e. \'born to the purple,\' as \rthe phrase is. Cf. too Pope, Essay on Criticism, 320, 32 [ : \r" A. vile conceit in pompous words expressed \r\rIs like a clown in regal purple dressed." \r\rThe contrast between the first and second pairs of wings, i.e. between \rpurple and gold, is a favourite with M.; see IV. 596, 763, 764, vn. \r479, ix. 429. \r\r283. i.e. colours brilliant as the lustrous hues of heaven ; the re- \rference to gold suggests that the rich hues of sunset are meant. \r\rPope arrayed the Sylphs in The Rape of the Lock (u. 2 13) in robes "Dipt \rin the richest tincture of the skies " ; and Wordsworth speaks of clouds \r"Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light" (The Prelude, iv. 328). \r\r28385. the third etc. What hue is here intended? Dr Masson \rsays violet Dr Bradshaw, purple. Perhaps light blue in fact, the \rcolour technically called \'sky-blue.\' This would suit the sense of grain, \rand it adds to the variety of the whole picture. \r\rmail, coat of mail, armour, sky - tinctured \'; cf. Comus, 83, "These \rmy sky- robes, spun out of Iris\' woof" (i.e. out of the rainbow). For \rtf^tora/st\'djed,\' cf. "vermeil-tinctured," Comus, 752. The "sky- \rworn Robes " of Pity represent one of the many Miltonisms in Collins \r(Ode to Pity, stanza 2). \r\r285 87. Maids son, Hermes (or Mercury), son of Zeus and \rMaia the winged messenger of the gods. Probably M. is thinking of \rsEneidiv. 222 et seq., where Mercury is sent by Jupiter to bid ^Eneas \rleave Carthage; perhaps also of Hamlet, in. 4. 58, 59. The point of \rthe simile lies in the fact that Mercury was typical of grace and beauty. \rSo in the Masque of Oberon Jonson makes a character say that Oberon \r("Beauty dwells but in his face") surpasses even Mercury, whereon \rJonson\'s footnote comments, " Mercury... was called the giver of grace, \rXapiSbTys, <f>aidpbs Kal Xeux6s." \r\rSome of Milton\'s readers would bethink them of the Jacobean \rMasque-stage, on which the god was a favourite character. These \rlines (285 87) would exactly describe the opening scene of Carew\'s \rfamous Ccehim Britannicum (known almost certainly to M.), and \rI doubt not that the heavenly herald "shook his plumes" in Jonson\'s \rPenates. For a similar episode, equally suggestive of the Masque- \rliterature, which had evidently affected M. strongly, cf. the descent of \rPeace in the Nativity Ode, 45 52. \r\r288. state, stately bearing, majesty J a common Shakespearian sense \rof a word then used with great variety of signification. \r\r292, 293. The plants are often mentioned together no doubt, \rfrom their association in Scripture. Cf. IX. 629, Comus t 991 ("Nard \r\r\r\r488 PARADISE LOST. BOOK V. \r\rand cassia\'s balmy smells"). So in Fairfax, Tasso, XV. 53, "The \rwinds breathed spikenard, myrrh, and balm around." The cassia \rspoken of in the Bible was a spice of the nature of cinnamon; cf. \rCotgrave, " Casse aromatique\\ the aromaticall wood, barke, or bastard \rcinnamon." Cassia is now used of an extract of laurel-bark. The \rnard or spikenard (i.e. spiked nard, nardus spicatus] of Scripture (Mark \rxiv. ^,John xii. 3) was a fragrant Indian root. The epithet \'IvdiKos is \roften applied to it. The word comes from the Sanskrit nal, \' to \rsmell.\' Probably the Jews got the perfume and its name through the \rPersians. \r\r295 97. In the First Ed. the lines read : \r\r"and plaid at will \r\rHer Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet, \rWilde above rule or art ; enormous bliss." \r\rWith this punctuation, enormous bliss is in apposition to the previous \rsentence; and pouring is intransitive. It appears to me a defensible \rtext; but editors place a comma after art, and make bliss the object \rafter pouring. more sweet, more sweetly (i.e. than now), enormous, \rout of all rule (Lat. norm a, \'rule\'). \r\r299. " And the Lord appeared unto him [Abraham] in the plains \rof Mamre : and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day," Genesis \rxviii. i. The whole chapter is in Milton\'s thoughts here where he \rdescribes Adam\'s entertainment of Raphael. \r\r302. needs\', so the Second Ed. ; the First has need. \r\r306. milky. So in S. A. 550, " clear milky juice " is a periphrasis \rfor fresh water. Perhaps in each case milky = \' sweet as milk.\' Drayton \r(Polyolbion, xm. 171) speaks of "milch dew," where he seems to mean \r4 sweet \' or * fragrant.\' \r\r31820. Here, as in 71 73, M. remembers Comus, 706 et seq. \rwhere the magician argues that we should enjoy Nature\'s gifts and \r\' disburden \' her of them : \r\r"Who would be quite surcharged with her own weight, \rAnd strangled with her waste fertility." \r\r321, 322. inspired, i.e. filled with "the breath of life" (Gen. ii. 7). \rThe name Adam is said to signify \' red earth.\' \r\r324, 325. i.e. she has only stored (cf. 314) or put away such things as \rare best kept awhile ; for the rest, the trees and plants supply their daily \rwants. In 322 store is used in two senses, viz. \' storing,\' and \'abundance.\' \r\r327. gourd, i.e. melons of various sorts. \r\r328. as 1 that\' is common in Elizabethan E. \r\r331 49. "The housewifery of our first parent" (Addison). \r\r333. choice to choose. "This sort of jingle is very usual in Milton, \r\r\r\rNOTES. 489 \r\ras to move motion, VITI. 130.. ..And it is not unusual in the best classick \rauthors, as m...sneid xn. 680" (Newton). Verbal repetition of the \rsort is thoroughly Elizabethan. Mr Bond in his introductory Essay to \rLyly\'s Works (i. 120 24) notes that it is one of the characteristic \rfeatures of style in Euphues ; imitated, doubtless, from the classics. It \rexplains and confirms the Folio\'s reading in Macbeth, V. 3. 44, where \remendations like load or grief for stuff, or fraught for stuff \'d, really \rproceed from ignorance of Elizabethan usage. \r\r334 36. The punctuation of the First and Second Eds. (which I \rhave retained) seems to show that the sense is \'tastes which are \rinelegant if not well joined.\' Some take inelegant adverbially \'not \rto mix inelegantly tastes which are not well joined.\' Either way, \rcf. IX. 1017, 1018. bring, i.e. to bring dependent on contrived\', one \rtaste is to induce another, kindliest, most natural; cf. "the kindly \rfruits of the earth" (The Litany). \r\r338. Earth, all-bearing mother ; Tretju/^rop 777 ; Omniparens. \r\r338 41. He supposes the garden of Eden to produce the fruits for \rwhich in after-times different parts of the world were famous; and, as \rusual, he selects places round the names of which cluster literary (espe- \rcially classical) associations. \r\r339. middle shore, i.e. between the East and West Indies; the \rcountries on the seaboard of the Mediterranean are meant. \r\r340. Pontus, in the N.E. region of Asia Minor, on the coast of \rthe Euxine or Black Sea, was noted for its fruit and nut trees. From \rthe town of Cerasus the cherry is said to have been introduced into \rEurope by Lucullus, together with its name (Gk. K^MUTOS). In Philemon \rHolland\'s Pliny (1601) we find: " Filberds and Hazels. ..also are a kind \rof nut. They came out of Pontus into Natolia and Greece, and therefore \rthey be called Ponticke nuts. These Filberds are covered with a soft \rbearded [cf. 342] huske," vol. I. p. 446. He mentions similarly the \rintroduction of the cherry-tree into Italy from Pontus (p. 448). \r\rPunic coast, i.e. Africa, more particularly Carthage ; it was remark- \rable for at least one kind of fruit, as the anecdote of Cato and the figs \rreminds us. Cf. Holland\'s Pliny, " touching the Aflricane Figs, many \rmen prefer [them] before all others," I. 442. \r\r340, 341. Alcinous was the king of the Phaeacians, a fabulous race \rwhom Homer places in the island of Scheria (afterwards identified with \rCorcyra, now Corfu whence Corey ra was called by Roman poets \rPh&acia tellus ; but probably Scheria was quite mythical). He enter- \rtained Odysseus, and Homer describes his palace and gardens at \rlength. M. refers in two other passages to those books (vi. xin.) \r\r\r\r4QO PARADISE LOST. BOOK V. \r\rof the Odyssey in which Odysseus stays "where Alcinous reigned"; \rcf. the Vacation, Exercise, 48 52 (alluding to Od. vin.), and P. L. \rix. 43941. See also his third Elegy, 43, 44 : \r\rNon dea tarn variis omavit floribus hortos \rAlcinoi Zephyro Chloris amata levi. \r\r342. rined; some texts print rind (i.e. the noun); but the First \rand Second Eds. read rin\'d, and M. meant it to be a participial \radjective, \'having a smooth rine (i.e. rind).\' I think that we may \rfairly hyphen the words and make a compound "smooth-rined," on \rthe analogy of "smooth-dittied," "smooth-haired," in Comus, 86, 716, \rand "smooth-shaven" in // Penseroso, 66. It seems to me best to \rmake the adj. qualify coat. \r\r345. Cf. Comus, 46, 47 : \r\r"Bacchus, that first from out the purple grape \r\rCrushed the sweet poison of misused wine." \r\rinoffensive, not intoxicating, as it became through " the later invention \rof fermenting the juice of the grape " (Thyer). must, new wine ; Lat. \rmitstum.

" That is, not burnt and exhaling smoke \ras in fumigations, but with its natural scent " (note in Todd). \r\r354 57. One of those passing touches in which M. reveals his \rrepublicanism and dislike of ostentation. \r\rScan retinue, as in P. R. II. 419, "What followers, what \rretinue canst thou gain?" So in Tennyson, Ay liner\'s Field, "The \rdark retinue reverencing death"; and in Guinevere.

Adam\'s meeting with Michael in \rXI. 249, and 29698. \r\rfor ; the clause gives the reason why Adam has addressed the angel \ras " Native of Heaven." Cf. Arcades, 26, 27 : \r\r" Stay, gentle Swains, for, though in this disguise, \rI see bright honour sparkle through your eyes " ; \rwhere "for I see" explains why they have been called "gentle," i.e. \rwell-born. Cf. n. 12 14, x. 46062. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 4QI \r\r371. Virtue. The word must not be pressed, as in P. L. Raphael \ris an archangel (cf. vn. 41). Heywood in his Hierarchic (1635) ranks \rRaphael among the Powers (^owtcu). \r\r378. Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit (Lat. pomum) ; she \r" might well be supposed to have a delightful arbour " (Newton). \r\r381, 382. Alluding to \\\\\\Q judicium Paridis. The three goddesses, \rHera, Athena and Aphrodite, each claimed the golden apple inscribed \rwith the words " to the fairest " which Eris (Strife) had thrown among \rthe guests at the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis. The matter was \rreferred to the shepherd Paris (afterwards the lover of Helen), who \rdecided in favour of Aphrodite "the fairest goddess feigned." \rPerhaps to many readers the story is most familiar through Tennyson\'s \rCEnone. \r\rIda, the " many-fountained " mountain (iro\\viridal- "I5a, Iliad vill. \r47) in Mysia, Asia Minor. Spenser speaks of Paris as "The Shepheard \rof Ida that judged beauties Queene," in The Shepheards Calender, \rAugust. \r\r384. virtue-proof, strong in (or \' through \') virtue. Commonly in \rthese compounds proof implies being strong against a thing. Thus in \rLove\'s Labour\'s Lost, v. 2. 513, shame-proof = \' strong against, i.e. im- \rpenetrable to, shame \' ; and in Arcades, 89, " branching elm star- \rproof" means that the leaves are so dense that the star-light cannot \rpenetrate. \r\r385 87.

Cf. IV. \r266 68, which anticipates the metaphor ("danced") of this passage. \rDrummond, A Cypress Grove, uses the same image: "One year is \rsufficient to behold all the magnificence of nature, nay, even one day \rand night; for more is but the same brought again. This sun, that \rmoon, these stars, the varying dance of the Spring, Summer, Autumn, \rWinter, is that very same which the golden age did see " ( Works, \rII. 256). \r\r396. "A terrible bathos after the beautiful imagery, but shows \rMilton\'s simplicity" (Tennyson). \r\r\r\r49 2 PARADISE LOST. BOOK V. \r\rAddison had noted that the line is one of the few colloquialisms in \rParadise Lost ; another being X. 736. \r\r407. We hear of "angels\' food," Psalm Ixxviii. ?<. See \r633. \r\r409. as doth\\ the singular verb is required, substance (not \rsubstances] being understood from 408. \r\r409 13. Cf. The Christian Doctrine, I. 7, "spirit being the \rmore excellent substance, virtually and essentially contains within itself \rthe inferior one (i.e. body) ; as the spiritual and rational faculty con- \rtains the corporeal," P. W. iv. 181. The drift of Milton\'s thought \rbecomes clearer when we read lines 469 et seq., where he dwells upon \rwhat he conceives to be the radical connection between matter and \rspirit. \r\r412. concoct, digest. \r\r415 18. See 18083. \r\r419, 420. M. regards the spots in the moon as vapours not entirely \rassimilated to her substance, and therefore visible against their luminous \rbackground. So in vui. 145, 146 he compares them to clouds. A \rsomewhat similar notion is found in Pliny\'s Natural History ; cf. \rPhilemon Holland\'s translation: "Now that planets are fed doubtlesse \rwith earthly moisture, it is evident by the Moone: which so long as \rshe appeaveth by the halfe in sight, never sheweth any spots, because \ras yet she hath not her full power of light sufficient, to draw humour \runto her. For these spots be nothing els but the dregs of the earth, \rcaught up with other moisture among the vapors" (1601 ed., vol. II. \rp. 7). It seems as if the true explanation of the spots, that they \rare unevennesses on the surface of the moon caused by mountains \rand valleys, were really known to Milton; cf. I. 287 91. \r\r425, 426. For the poetic fancy that the sun rises from and sets in \rthe sea, cf. Coinus, 95 97. \r\r427, 428. The introduction of nectar (cf. 633) was doubtless due to \rits classical associations as the drink of the gods. There are occasions \rwhen Milton\'s classical touches seem a little out of harmony with the \rScriptural character of his theme. Instances of this confusion of effect \rare very marked in Lycidas. \r\r428, 429. A recollection of Arcades, 50, " [I] from the boughs brush \roff the evil dew." Everyone will recall Gray\'s " Brushing with hasty \rsteps the dew away," Elegy, 99. The emphatic word is " mellifluous " : \rthe dews of Eden are of no common kind. \r\r430. pearly grain, i.e. dew-drops; cf. 2, 746, 747. But some take \rit to mean manna; cf.

Bishop Newton remarks \r" Several of the Fathers and ancient Doctors were of opinion, that \rthe Angels did not really eat, but only seemed to do so; and they \rground that opinion principally upon what the Angel Raphael says in \rthe book of Tobit, xii. 19, \' All these days did I appear unto you, but \rI did neither eat nor drink, but you did see a vision.\'" \r\rWe have already had an allusion to the Book of Tobit in lines \r221 23; Keightley notes that it was evidently a favourite with M.; \rprobably he was here glancing at the verse cited by Newton. \r\r435. gloss, interpretation, viz. of passages like Gen. xix. 3. \r\r438. what redottnds, i.e. all that is redundant, not assimilated. \r\r439 43.

The phrase (from Gen. vi. 2) has been taken to \rmean either the angels or the pious descendants of Seth. Here (and in \rP. R. II. 178, 179) M. apparently adopts the former view; but in xi. \r621, 622, the other. Josephus, Antiq. I. iii. I, makes "sons of God" = \rangelic beings. \r\r451,452. See xi. 531, note. \r\r460. framed; it implies care, skill; cf.

Hierarch, member of the Hierarchies, i.e. \' heavenly being \' ; \rused once elsewhere, xi. 220 (of Michael). \r\r469 et seq. This is one of the passages in which the treatise on The \rChristian Doctrine is valuable as explaining Milton\'s philosophical and \rtheological views. Chapter 7 of the first book treats "Of the Creation," \rand he expounds at great length his conception of the "one first matter." \rHis views, as admirably summarised by Dr Masson, amount to this \r" that all created Being, whether called soul or body, consists of but \rone primordial matter, a direct efflux from the very substance of the \r\rEternal and Infinite Spirit that there are graduated varieties or \r\rsorts of this first material efflux from Deity, all radically one, but \rdifferentiated into an ascending series of forms, from the inorganic \ras the lowest, up to the vegetable, thence to the animal, thence to the \rhuman, and so to the angelic, or nearest in nature to the Divine \roriginal." This passage in fact gives us what Adam afterwards (509) \rcalls "the scale of Nature." \r\rThe long discourses and explanations which Milton puts in the \rmouth of Raphael seem to come much more naturally from him, an \rarchangel, than the discourses with which Beatrice enlightens Dante in \rthe Paradiso, e.g. on Free Will (v.), the Atonement (vn.), the motion \rof the heavenly bodies, such as the Primum Mobile (xxvn.), the \rCreation (xxix.). \r\r471. created all, i.e. all things created such (namely "good ") to a \rperfect degree, and all made of one first original matter. Cf. The \rChristian Doctrine, I. 7, "For the original matter of which we speak, \ris not to be looked upon as an evil or trivial thing, but as intrinsically \rgood, and the chief productive stock of every subsequent good. It was \ra substance, and derivable from no other source than from the fountain \r\r\r\rNOTES. 495 \r\rof every substance, though at first confused and formless, being after- \rwards adorned and digested into order by the hand of God" (P. W. \rIV. 179). Cf. VII. 233. \r\rThe influence of these lines is very marked in the Essay on Man, I. ; \rcf. especially 233 46, and the great passage, "All are but parts of \rone stupendous whole " etc. \r\r478. This idea (cf. 497) of body refining into spirit (i.e. of matter \rpassing from a lower to a higher stage) is very characteristic of Milton. \rCf. Camus, 45963 : \r\r"Till oft converse with heavenly habitants \rBegin to cast a beam on the outward shape, \rThe unpolluted temple of the mind, \rAnd turns it by degrees to the soul\'s essence, \rTill all be made immortal." \r\rIn the same speech he passes (467 69) to the converse idea that, \ras the body by self-discipline may become soul, so the soul by self- \rindulgence may become body: \r\r" The soul grows clotted by contagion, \rImbodies, and imbrutes, till she quite lose \rThe divine property of her first being." \r\rCf. again vi. 660, 661, IX. 166. Newton thinks, very justly, that the \rwhole idea was suggested by the Scriptural doctrine (cf. i Cor. xv.) of \ra natural body changed into a spiritual ; perhaps also the influence of \rPlato is to be traced ; cf. the notes on the passage in Comus. \r\r482. To take the first two feet as cases of inverted rhythm gives \ra perfectly Miltonic effect " spirits | odorjous " etc. \r\r483. scale, ladder, Lat. scala ; cf. 509, vni. 591. Pope speaks of \rthe continuity of Nature, "Where, one step broken, the great scale\'s \rdestroyed," Essay on Man, i. 244. Cf. also Thomson, Spring: \r\r"who knows, how raised to higher life, \rFrom stage to stage, the vital scale ascends?" \r\rsublimed, raised; the metaphor (as in i. 235) is probably from the \rscience of chemistry, in which to sublime is to \' raise or elevate by \rheat.\' Cf. Bacon, "Metals are sublimed by joining them with \rmercury or salts." Cf. the chemical term * sublimate.\' \r\r487 90. This contrast between intuition and discourse (in its old \rsense) occurs often: intuition, as its derivation (Lat. intueri, \'to look \rinto \') implies, being the faculty of seeing into things straightway and \rapprehending truth without any process of reasoning: discourse, the \rlower faculty of understanding things by means of reasoning processes. \rM. naturally assigns the higher power to the angels ; so in The \rChristian Doctrine, i. 9, he says that the good angels understand by \r\r\r\r496 PARADISE LOST.

The underlying doctrine (taught by many of the Father*?) is \rthat Adam, had he not sinned and thereby become "mortal" (viu. \r331), i.e. liable to death, would have been translated to Heaven. \r\r504. your fill, i.e. enjoy to your fill. This adverbial use is Biblical ; \rcf. Deuteronomy xxiii. 24, "When thou comest into thy neighbour\'s \rvineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure." \rM. has the expression (now colloquial) in Sonnet xiv. 14, "And drink \rthy fill of pure immortal streams." Cf. Leviticus xxv. 19, "And the \rland shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill." \r\r509, 510. "Matter" (472) is the "centre," and "Nature" the \r" scale " which reaches to the utmost of our conceptions, all round. \rBy ascending this ladder, i.e. by the study of Nature, we are led to \rGod (Richardson). \r\r520. " The sentences here are very short, as everything ought to be \rin the preceptive way. Quicquid pracipies, esto brevis, is the rule of \rHorace de Arte Poetica, 335 " (Newton). \r\r5 7 5 34\' A discourse on free will and predestination, similar to \rthat in in. 96 128. It is one of the subjects whereof the fallen \rangels dispute in n. 557 61 ; and of course M. treats it at great \rlength in The Christian Doctrine, P. IV. IV. 43 77. \r\r535. Cf. The Christian Doctrine, I. 3, " in assigning the gift of \rfree will, God suffered both men and angels to stand or fall at their \rown uncontrolled choice " (P. W. iv. 38). \r\r538. i.e. on no other surety ; in these cases none, from its peculiar \rposition, expresses emphasis. Cf. XI. 612. \r\r543. from what... into what.

We may compare the long episodical description that follows of \rthe expulsion of the apostate angels from Heaven with Eneas\' narrative \r\r\r\rNOTES. 497 \r\rto Dido of the fall of Troy and of his subsequent fortunes. Eneas\' \rmonologue occupies two books (II., in.) of the ^Lneid\\ Raphael is \rbriefer; his narrative closes at 892 of bk. vi. Such episodical narra- \rtives of what preceded the commencement of the action of the poem \rhave been part of the machinery of the epic, since Homer made \rOdysseus relate his adventures to Alcinous (Newton). \r\rMilton was bound to describe these events; and he appropriately \rlays the description in the mouth* of one who had taken part in them. \rThe obvious danger that besets a passage of this kind in which we are \rlifted from earth to Heaven is, that the poet may seem to materialise \rand degrade things spiritual and supernatural by delineating them under \rimagery and in language associated with things corporal and earthly. \rM. warns us of this difficulty at the outset (571 74); and hints that \rafter all earth may be but a symbol of Heaven an idea which under \rvarious forms has occurred to many thinkers. Dante also dwells on \rthe impossibility of describing (" figuring") Paradise (xxni. 61). The \rother " episode" in Paradise Lost occurs in bks. XL, xn. ; see note on \rxi. 356 58. Newton notes that the form of the beginning (563, 564) \rof Raphael\'s narrative recalls the opening words of /Eneas in SEneidu. 3. \r\rSpenser\'s two Hymnes Of Heavenly Love and Of Heavenly Beautie \rare like an introduction to Milton\'s narrative of the fall of the angels \rand the subsequent creation of Man and the Universe. No part of \rSpenser presents closer parallels to Paradise Lost. \r\r566. remorse, pity. \r\r578. these Heavens, i.e. the sky above them ; not the upper Heaven \ror Empyrean in which the Deity dwells (Masson). \r\r579. upon her centre poised.

So Pope, Temple of Fame : \r\r" In air self-balanced hung the globe below, \r\rWhere mountains rise and circling oceans flow." \rwhen on a day. This curious phrase occurs in Cowper\'s Heroism, 1 1. \r580 82. M. refers to the definition of \'Time as the measure of \rmotion\'; cf.

Milton\'s second epitaph \ron Hobson the carrier : \r\r"Time numbers motion, yet (without a crime \r\r\'Gainst old truth) motion numbered out his time." \rMilton\'s purpose in 580 82 is to justify his introduction of the \rnotion of Time in the word "day," 579: for that which he is \r\rP. L. 32 \r\r\r\r498 PARADISE LOST. BOOK V. \r\rdescribing took place before the creation of the universe : whereas, \rsays Plato, "days and nights and months and years -were itot before \rthe universe was created. ..he (the Deity) devised the generation of \rthem along with the fashioning of the universe," Timaus 37 D; \rand again, "Time then has come into being along with the universe" \rXpovos 5\' ow per\' otpavov ytyovcv, Timctus 38 B. See Spenser\'s Hymne \rof Heavenly Love, 11 28. It would be impossible to discuss the \rmatter : we can only note that M. dissents from Plato both here and \rin The Christian Doctrine, I. 7, where he writes : " There is no \rsufficient foundation for the common opinion, that motion and time \r(which is the measure of motion) could not, according to the ratio of \rpriority and subsequence, have existed before this world was made " \r(P. W. iv. 185). \r\rby. ..past and future, i.e. by the standard of or, in relation \rto ; cf.

He has borrowed Plato\'s conception of the \rAnnus Magnus. This was the vast period (estimated by Mr Adam in \rhis pamphlet on the Nuptial Number of Plato to be 36,000 years) at the \rclose of which the heavenly spheres, having completed their several \rrevolutions, come back to the position whence they started. Cf. the \rpassage from Censorinus (a scientific writer of Rome of the 3rd century \rA.D.) quoted by Mr Newman, Politics of Aristotle, I. 576, Est pr&tcrea \rannus... quern soils luna vagarumque quinque stellarum orbes conficiunt, \rcum ad idem sigitum, ubi quondam simul fuerunt, una referuntur. \rCf. too Heywood\'s Hierarchie (1635), p. 147 : \r\r"There is a yeare, that in Times large progresse \r\rIs Annus Magnus call\'d: \r\rin this \'tis sayd, \r\rThe Stars and Planets, howsoeuer sway\'d, \rBe they or fixt, or wandring; in this yeare \rReturne to their first state, and then appeare \rIn their owne Orbs, unwearied, and instated \rAs fresh and new as when at first created " ; \r\rand the Religio Medici, i. vi. : "To see ourselves again, we need not \rlook for Plato\'s year ; every man is not only himself... men are lived over \ragain." Marvell (The First Anniversary, 17, 18), contrasting unpro- \rgressive rulers with Cromwell under an astronomical simile, says : \r"And though they all Platonic years should reign, \r\rIn the same posture [they] would be found again." \rM. conceives some such Platonic cycles to have existed "in \r\r\r\rNOTES. 499 \r\reternity," and the close of one of them to have been marked by the \revent of which he proceeds to speak. There is a glance at the same \rthought in 861, 862. Wordsworth in the poem on his infant daughter \r("Hast thou then survived!") evidently had Milton\'s lines in mind, \rthough he seems to have quoted from memory, substituting " Heaven\'s \reternal year " for "great.

Cf. III. 3, "God is light." \r\r603 608. Upon the peculiar theological bearing of this passage it \ris unnecessary to comment; we have in. 383 (note) already seen \rMilton\'s Arianism. Many texts of Scripture are alluded to here. Cf. \rPs. ii. 6, 7 ("Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion.... \rThou art my Son ; this day have I begotten thee"), Ps. ex. i ("The \rLORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand"), Ephes. iv. 15 \r("the head, even Christ"), Gen. xxii. !i6 ("By myself have I sworn, \rsaith the LORD" see also Isai. xlv. 23), Philip, ii. 10, n, Heb. i. 5. \r\r" Milton was very cautious what sentiments and language he \rascribed to the Almighty, and generally confined himself to the phrases \rand expressions of Scripture " (Newton). \r\r322 \r\r\r\r500 PARADISE LOST.

Tabernaculum is used in the \rVulgate of the tent that sheltered the Ark, whence it passed into the \rAuthorised Version. Milton has the word ( = \'tent\') satirically in his \rprose : "They had found a good tabernacle, they sat under a spreading \rvine, their lot was fallen in a fair inheritance " (P.

BOOK V. \r\rcf. "companion dear" in 673. No doubt, M. knew Marlowe\'s play; cf. \rI. 254, 255, iv. 2023 and 75 78 with Dr Faustus, in. 75 77, v. 1 19 \r21. The suggestion has been made not unreasonably, I think that \rthe Theatrum Poetarum (1675) of Milton\'s nephew Edward Phillips, in \rwhich short biographies and notices of the poets are given, \' \' especially \rthe most eminent of all ages," reflects in some degree Milton\'s own \ropinions. It is significant therefore that Phillips calls Marlowe "a \rkind of a second Shakespeare," and specially mentions this tragedy: \r" of all that he hath written to the Stage his Dr Faustus hath made the \rgreatest noise." The judgment pronounced on Shakespeare himself is \rplainly Miltonic, viz. that "where the polishments of Art are most \rwanting, as his Learning was not extraordinary, he pleaseth with a \rcertain wild and native elegance"; cf. L 1 Allegro, 133, 134. \r\r673. sleep \'st thou... ? Cf. Iliad II. 60 62. \r\r674. and rememberest, i.e. though remembering ; cf.

So in Tennyson, The Last Tournament : \r\r"Thieves, bandits... \r\rMake their last head like Satan in the North." \rBunyan follows the same tradition ; cf. The Holy War \\ \' \' Now upon \rMount Diabolus, which was raised on the north side of the town \r[Mansoul], there did the tyrant [Diabolus] set up his standard " \r("Temple" ed., p. 252). \r\rAccording to some systems of demonology the four quarters of the \rworld were assigned to four angels prior to the expulsion of the \rrebels from Heaven. Commonly Lucifer was made monarch of the \rnorth in allusion to /sat. xiv. 12, 13, " How art thou fallen from \r\rheaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! For thou hast said in \r\rthine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the \rstars of God : I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in \rthe sides of the north." But the systems varied; thus Dr Ward \rin his edition of Marlowe\'s Faustus notes that in the old Faust- \rbook it is Beelzebub who rules in the north, in Septentrione, while \rLucifer rules in Oriente ; cf. the title " prince of the East " applied to \rhim by Marlowe (Faustus, v. 104). \r\rThe general reference to the north as the dominion of evil spirits \rmight be illustrated from many sources. Greene in Friar Bacon speaks \rof a demon Asmenoth as "guider of the north" (ix. 144), and "ruler of \rthe north" (xi. 109). Cf. i Henry VI. v. 3. 6. In the Appendix \radded in 1665 to Scot\'s Discourse on Devils there are similar references \re.g. in chap. VIII., " Luridan is a Familiar Domestick Spirit of the \r\r\r\r\r\r\rNOTES. 503 \r\rNorth, who is now become servant to Balkin, Lord and King of the \rNorthern Mountains" (p. 485, Nicholson\'s ed.); and again in chap, ix., \r"These are the names... of Olympick Angels, governing the North, and \rruling over every Airy Spirit that belongs unto the Northern Climate," \rp. 487.

When M. speaks of Heaven his language, as we \rhave seen, is full of reminiscences of the Revelation. \r\r716. Cf. the Nativity Ode, 119, "But when of old the Sons of \rMorning sung." The phrase is from Isaiah xiv. 12. \r\r734- lightening. I should be inclined to take it as a noun, in \rapposition to "Son" cf. 457, 458 did not the First Ed. print it \rLightening, which implies that it was meant to be a participle (divine - \r\'divinely\'). Contrast VI. 642 : there it is a noun, and the First Ed. has \rLightning\', so in i. 175, II. 66. \r\r736, 737- Cf. u. 190, 191, note. \r\r739. illustrates, makes illustrious.

In the Paradiso, xxix., Dante \ronly says " a part of the Angels," but in the Convivio, II. 6. 9599, "he \rhad expressly declared that some, perhaps a tenth, of each Order fell " \r(note in " Temple " ed. ). \r\r759. See vi. 364, note. \r\r762 66. The main verb is called. The allusion is to Isaiah xiv. 13 \r(see 688, 689, note), where the "mount of the congregation" may be \rZion. See vn. 131. \r\r763. affecting, aiming at, seeking to obtain ; cf. Lat. affectare. Cf. \rin. 206, "affecting Godhead," and 2 Henry VI. iv. 7. 104, "Have I \raffected wealth or honour? Speak." \r\r768. pretending... commanded-, cf. perhaps S. A. 212, "pretend \rthey ne\'er so wise," which may mean \'pretend to be wise.\' M. is \rimitating the Lat. Simula; cf. Livy xxv. 8 [Hannibal} agrum \rsimulabat. \r\r772. In the First Ed. there is only a comma at the end of this \rline and I see no occasion to change the punctuation. Satan addresses \rthe angels by their habitual titles, and then sarcastically adds that he is \rnot quite sure whether they ought still to claim those titles. For the \rsame brevity of phrase, in which it is easy to trace the half-expressed \rtrain of thought in the speaker\'s mind, cf. 360 62, note.

The \rTwo Gentlemen of Verona, iv. 2. 67, King Lear, iv. 7. 16), and the \rnoun jar ( discord \' ; cf. As You Like It, n. 7. 5, " If he, compact of \rjars, grow musical." consist, are consistent with. Cf. Pope, Essay on \rMan, IV. 8 1, 82 : \r\r"But health consists with temperance alone, \r\rAnd peace, O Virtue ! peace is all thy own." \r798. Scan edict, as in S. A. 301, the only other place in M. where \rit occurs. Shakespeare has both edict (A Midsummer-Nights Dream, \rI. i. 151) and edict (i Henry IV.

Why, he contends, impose laws on those who \rneed no law to make them walk aright? \r\r799. The line is a well-known crux. I think that for this=* for \rthis reason, on this account\' (cf.for that, 874), namely, that the angels \rare "without law." *If,\' argues Satan, \'we can do right without the \rrestrictions of laws, surely that is a reason why we should not have \ra law-giving lord set over us.\' The clause seems added as an after- \rthought, to be having no strict construction, but depending on some \rwords like \'ought he\' or \'is he\' which the speaker has in his mind, \rthough he does not express them. We must remember that the line is \rspoken, and that M. introduces into his speeches (see 772, note) just the \rkind of verbal irregularities, the swift turns of thought and phrase, \rthat belong to oratory such e.g. as we get constantly in Thucydides. \rThey are frequent in S. A. where, as Coleridge happily said, the "logic \rof passion " often prevails over the "logic of grammar." \r\r\r\r506 PARADISE LOST. BOOK V. \r\rSome take for ^w = \'for this purpose\': \'who can claim lordship \rfor the purpose of introducing laws and edicts ? \' \r\rOthers interpret : \'who can in reason... introduce law and edict upon \rthem ?...much less for [i.e. because of] this introdviction of law and edict \rclaim the right of dominion?\' \r\r805. A bdiel, \'servant of God.\' \r\r807. The Seraphim typified ardour, and the idea is reflected \rappropriately in the passion ("flame") of Abdiel\'s speech. \r\r809.

" Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against \rGod ? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou \rmade me thus?" Romans ix. 20, where observe the marginal reading \r" disputest with God." The thought is worked out in S. A. 307 14. \r\r835 41. The main reference is to Colos. i. 16, 17; see 853 64. \r\rhis Word\\ cf. III. 170, 383, notes. \r\r842 45. The argument seems to be that Christ, by becoming the \rhead of the angels, became in a measure one of them, and so ennobled \rtheir nature. \r\r853 64. Contrast iv. 42, 43, where Satan admits (to himself) \rwhat he here denies, viz. that he and the other angels were created by \rGod ; and see IX. 146, 147. In The Christian Doctrine, I. 7, M. says, \r"That the angels were created at some particular period, we have the \rtestimony of Numbers xvi. 22 and xxvii. 16"; and he instances other \rtexts, among them being Colos. i. 16. \r\rThe great distinction drawn in the Paradise, xxix., between the good \rangels and the evil is that the former admitted their creation by the \rAlmighty. Beatrice says to Dante (58 60) : " Those whom thou \rseest here [in Paradise] were modest to acknowledge themselves de- \rrived from that same Excellence which made them swift to so great \runderstanding." \r\r857,858. Cf. vin. 251. \r\r86 1, 862. See 583, note, fatal course, the course of fate. "Our \rauthor [says Newton] makes Satan a sort of fatalist.... No compliment to \rfatalism to put it into the mouth of the Devil." \r\r864. "Thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things," Ps. xlv. 4. \r\r869. beseeching or besieging ; another of those jingles which M. \ruses generally to express sarcasm or contempt as here. Cf. I. 642. \rThe Elizabethan writers may have adopted this literary artifice from the \rItalians; cf. Marlowe, 2 Tamburlaine, V. 3, " Hell and darkness pitch \rtheir pitchy tents," and Faustus (first chorus) : \r\r\r\rNOTES. SO/ \r\r"We must perform \rThe form of Faustus\' fortunes." \r\r872. "And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, \rand as the voice of many waters," Rev. xix. 6. It is, in character, \ressentially a Miltonic simile. Cf. his pamphlet Animadversions, 5 : \r"O thou the ever-begotten Light and perfect Image of the Father!... \rThou hast sent out the spirit of prayer upon thy servants over all the \rland to this effect, and stirred up their vows as the sound of many \rwaters about thy throne" (P. W. ill. 71). \r\rWordsworth applies the comparison to Milton himself in the first of \rhis two Sonnets on Milton ("Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like \rthe sea "). \r\r875. flaming Seraph ; cf. 807, and see p. 681. \r\r87881. In the First Ed. there is no comma after crew, the \rconstruction being, \' I see thy fall determined, thy crew involved etc., \rand contagion spread\' (i.e. three clauses dependent on I see), spread \rbeing a p.p. like determined and involved. Some editors place a comma \rafter crew and make spread an infinitive* I see thy crew, being in- \rvolved etc., spread destruction\' (i.e. only two clauses dependent on \rI see). "Foul contagion spread" occurs in Lyddas, 127. \r\r88688. See II. 327, 328, note. In his treatise Of Reformation \rin England, n, M. writes: "let him advise how he can reject the \rpastorly rod and sheephook of Christ, and those cords of love, and not \rfear to fall under the iron sceptre of his anger, that will dash him to \rpieces like a potsherd" (P. W. II. 412). \r\r890. Cf. Numbers xvi. 26, " Depart, I pray you, from the tents of \rthese wicked men " an appropriate allusion, as Moses is there dis- \rsuading the congregation of Israel from joining Korah and his followers \rwho, like Satan and his angels, were rebels. Cf. xi. 607, 608. \r\rdevoted, doomed. Abdiel\'s meaning, put rather tersely, is * I do \rnot fly because of your advice (871) or threats, but lest the wrath etc.* \r\r893. his thunder : see VI. 834 38. \r\r899. A favourite type of verse with M. and many other English \rpoets. Cf. II. 185, in. 231. Perhaps, when he wrote this line (899) \rMilton had in mind his own position at the Restoration. The personal \rnote is strong in his poetry. Cf. VI. 29 37, note. \r\r906, 907. retorted, flung back ; for this, the literal use, cf. Romeo \rand Juliet, in. i. 169, Troilns and Cressida, ill. 3. 101. \r\r\r\r508 PARADISE LOST. BOOK VI. \r\r\r\rBOOK VI. \r\rAddison evidently considered this book one of the greatest in the \rpoem. He notes that our expectation has been raised by allusions to \rthe struggle in books I. and II. \r\ri, 2. the... Angel, Abdiel. champain, plains. \r\r2 4. From Ovid, Metamorphoses n. 112 14: \r\recce vigil nitido fatefecit ab ortu \rpurpureas Aurora fores et plena rosarum \ratria. \r\rHomer makes the Hours keep the gates of Olympus ; cf. Giles Fletcher, \rDeath of Elizabeth : \r\r"The early Howres were readie to unlocke \rThe doore of Morne, to let abroad the Day." \r\r3. with rosy hand. Cf. Jonson, Masque of Oberon, " And with her \rrosy hand puts back the stars " (said of the morn). It is suggested by \rHomer\'s po5o8dKTv\\os ijws, whence "rosy-fingered" became in poetry a \rtraditional epithet of the dawn ; cf. Crashaw\'s pretty lines in To the \rMorning : \r\r" And the same rosy-finger\'d hand of thine \rThat shuts Night\'s dying eyes shall open mine." \r\r4 12. See V. 643, 644. The notion of light and darkness "dis- \rlodging by turns," the one going out as the other comes in, had its \rorigin in Hesiod, Theogony 747, 748 (Newton). \r\r8. vicissitttde, alternation; cf. VII. 351. \r\r10. obsequious, obedient, doing its duty (cf. 783); not in the modern \rdepreciatory sense, \'servile.\' \r\ru, 12. i.e. what is thought darkness in Heaven (where there is no \rnight, v. 645) would seem twilight on earth. \r\r19. in procinct, ready. "The Roman soldiers were said to stand \rin procinctu, when ready to give the onset " (Hume) ; from the noun \rprocinctus, \'a being prepared for battle.* Cf. the p.p. procinctus, \r\'prepared\' literally \'girded up,\' from procingere, \'to gird or tuck up \rthe dress.\' M. uses succinct in that sense, ill. 643. \r\r2937. Servant of God\\ see V. 805. Texts glanced at are : Mat. \rxxv. 21 ; i Tim. vi. 12 ; 2 Tim. iv. 7, " I have fought a good fight " ; \rPs. Ixix. 7, " for thy sake I have borne reproach " ; and 2 Tim. \rii. 15. \r\rIs Milton here thinking of himself? He too had sacrificed all to \r\r\r\rNOTES. 509 \r\r" the testimony of truth " (as he judged), and borne reproach for his \rallegiance to the cause of republicanism when the "revolted multitudes" \rwent back to the old order of things and acclaimed the Restoration. \rThere is a constant play of personal and contemporary allusion in his \rpoems. See 462, xi. 54246, 632 36, 808 18, and S. A. 697 \r700, 1457 72 (with the notes); and compare Dante\'s allusions to \rhis treatment by Florence, and her corruptions, e.g. in the Paradiso, \rxxxi. 3739. \r\r34.

Pope has it in \ra different sense = \' the reasoning faculty\'; cf. the Essay on Criticism, \r211, 212 : \r\r"If once right reason drives that cloud away, \rTruth breaks upon us with resistless day"; \r\rwhere the "cloud" is the pride that obscures our judgment.

Michael, the leader of the \rangels, is introduced (Rev. xii.)- in the capacity of a hostile commander \rwaging war with the prince of the devils, the armies on both sides \rbeing drawn out in battle array" (cf. 105 107). prince; cf.

Coriolanus, 11. \r2. 119, " the din of war gan pierce." Probably the omission was partly \rdue to the old use of gan, the pret. of ginnen, as an auxiliary verb = \r\' did.\' Thus in Spenser " gan blow " might mean \'did blow \' ; and M. \rmay have revived the idiom, as some think. But wherever he uses^aw, \r\'beginning\' is implied ; cf. IX. 1016, x. 710, P. R. IV. 410. \r\r62. stood for, fought for; cf. Coriolanus, II. 2. 45, IV. 6. 45. \r\r63 68.

Many \reditors take bristled as a p.p., supplying appeared from 79 as the main \rverb to go with powers in 85 an awkward ellipse surely. beams t \rshafts of the spears, various, varied, made diverse. \r\rHey wood (Hierarchic, p. 341) says of the combat : \r\r"No Lances, Swords, nor Bombards they had then, \rOr other weapons now in use with men ; \rNone of the least materiall substance made, \rSpirits by such giue no offence or aid, \rOnely spiritual Armes to them were lent." \r\rMilton\'s description is throughout material and realistic. His battle is \ra Homeric fray, slightly idealised. Editors refer also to many passages \r\r\r\r( \r\r\r\rNOTES. 5 1 1 \r\rin Ariosto and Tasso and Spenser (especially) which show what models \rMilton had in his mind when he pictured the single combats between \rthe warrior angels. \r\r84. argument, designs, subjects ; a Latinism.

Like speeches and dialogues \rthey serve, somewhat artificially, to vary the narrative which, cast in \rone continuous form, would become monotonous. Somewhat similar is \rShakespeare\'s use of interruptions and questions to vivify a lengthy piece \rof narrative, e.g. in The Tempest, I. 2, where Miranda breaks in on the \rlong story in which Prospero unfolds their history, and in Coriolanus, \rI. i, in Menenius\'s "fable."

Cf. \rTroilus and Crtssida, I. 3. 89 92 : \r\r"And therefore is the glorious planet Sol \rIn noble eminence enthroned and sphered \rAmidst the other [i.e. planets] ; whose medicinable eye \rCorrects the ill aspects of planets evil." \rM. mentions the five main " aspects," x. 657 61. \r\rWhen two planets are distant from each other by half the circle, \ri.e. are in diametrically opposite parts of the heavens, they are said, in \rastrological language, to be "in opposition." And it is "a malign \raspect," because the rays of the two bodies collide and strive for \rmastery, shedding a " noxious efficacy " (x. 660) on the earth. The \rElizabethans often refer to this notion ; cf. Dr Faustus, VI. 65, " why \rhave we not... oppositions, eclipses all at one time?" Dr Ward in his \redition of Dr Faustus, p. 172, also refers to Marlowe\'s 2 Tamburlaine, \rIII. 5, and to Greene\'s fames IV. I. i. See pp. 691, 692. \r318. determine, make an end of the matter ; cf.

"Michael\'s sword with the down-stroke cut that of Satan \rin two, and then with an up-stroke (coup de revers) it \'shared\' his side" \r(Keightley). \r\rshared, cut, laid open ; used by Spenser, e.g. in The Faerie \rQueene, iv. 2. 17, V. 5. 9. Cf. shear, share (a portion), plough-share, \rall from the root skar, seen in Gk. Kelpetv, Lat. secare. \r\r327. first knew pain. See 362, 394, 431, 432. Only the rebellious \rangels are sensible of physical pain ; and the reason is given in 691 \r"sin hath impaired." Through sin they have made gross (cf. 66 1) the \rpure " essence" of their original forms ; and spirit has deteriorated into \rmatter (cf. v. 478, note), rendering them vulnerable. The obedient \rangels are invulnerable because innocent (400 403). \r\rJohnson\'s criticism, however, seems just : " The confusion of spirit \rand matter, which pervades the whole narration of the war of heaven, \rfills it with incongruity." \r\r329. griding, piercing, cutting through. " Discontinuous wound is \rsaid in allusion to the old definition of a wound, that it separates the \rcontinuity of the parts" (Newton). In surgical language, vulnus est \rsohitio continui. Bacon uses discontinuation in the medical sense, \r\'solution of continuity,\' in a list of diseases (The Advancement of \rLearning, II. 10. 5). Cf. also his Essay Of Unity in Religion\'. u as \rin the natural body a wound or solution of continuity is worse than \ra corrupt humour, so in the spiritual." \r\r33> 33i Happily imitated in The Rape of the Lock, in. 151, 152 : \r" Fate urg\'d the shears, and cut the Sylph in twain \r\r(But airy substance soon unites again)." \r\rCf. too Wordsworth, Laodamia, "The Phantom parts, but parts to \rreunite."

The whole \rpicture of the wounded chief being rescued by his friends and borne \rfrom the field to his chariot is Homeric (e.g. Iliad xiv. 428 32). \r\r339. files, ranks ; cf. I. 567, "the armed files." \r\r348, 349. liquid texture, i.e. the "essence" of which he speaks \rin I. 424, 425 " soft and uncompounded." \r\rno more than can the fluid air. A favourite poetic comparison ; \rcf. Hamlet, i. i. 143 46, referring to the Ghost, at which the \rwatchmen have struck with their halberds: \r\r" We do it wrong, being so majestical, \rTo offer it the show of violence ; \rFor it is, as the air, invulnerable, \rAnd our vain blows malicious mockery." \r\rMacbeth, deeming himself invulnerable, says to Macduff (v. 8. \r9, 10) : \r\r"As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air \r\rWith thy keen sword impress as make me bleed"; \rwhere intrenchant =\' not to be cut\' (Fr. trencher, \'to cut\'), the whole \rphrase being a variation on Hamlet, IV. i. 44, "the woundless \rair" (i.e. that cannot be wounded). There is the same idea in \rThe Tempest, in. 3. 6163. Sir Thomas Browne writes: "The \rghosts are afraid of swords in Homer ; yet Sibylla tells ^Eneas in \rVirgil, the thin habit of spirits was beyond the force of weapons " (Urn \rBurial, IV.). \r\r35 ! 53- Cf. I. 428, 429, n. 948, notes. \r\r354 85. With regard to some of the names here and later we \rhave seen (i. 36175) that M. adopted the mediaeval notion that the \rdeities of heathenism, oriental and classical, were the apostate angels. \rHe could not describe their rebellion without giving them some titles : \rthis belief (based upon texts such as Levit. xvii. 7, i Cor. x. 20) supplied \rhim with suitable names. \r\r355. the might of Gabriel, the mighty Gabriel ; exactly the Homeric \ruse of /SIT;, as in \'the might of Hercules,\' or \'the Herculean might,\' for \r\' the mighty Hercules.\' Cf. the use of the abstract in Latin, as in \rHorace\'s mitis sapientia L<zli (\' the wisdom of Lselius \' = the wise Lselius), \ror prisci Catonis... virtus. Cf. Dryden, ALn. vi. 942, "the filial duty \rthus replies," i.e. the dutiful son. See 371, 372, vi. 722, vn. 175. \r\r357. Moloch illustrates his character in his speech in n. 51 105 : \r\r\r\rNOTES. 5I/ \r\rhis "ferocious character," says Johnson, "appears, both in the battle \rand the council, with exact consistency." Cf. I. 392, 393. \r\r359. 360. Alluding to 2 Kings xix. 22. Scan blasphemous. \r\r362. uncouth, strange. \r\r363. Uriel. See in. 648, 649, note. Raphael can speak of his \rown exploits thus because his name was not known to Adam \r(Bentley). \r\r364. See note on 831 41. Some editors interpret diamond^ \r\'adamant\' (cf. no, 255); the words, etymologically identical, were \rsometimes treated as synonymous. But we hear of " diamond quarries," \rV. 759, and of "diamond rocks," Comus, 88 1, where diamond must \rbear its common sense : perhaps it does here : applied to angelic beings \rthe description would not be extravagant. \r\r365. Adramelech, * magnificence of the king\' ; a deity whose worship \rwas brought to Samaria by the colonists from Sepharvaim (2 Kings \rxvii. 31). He represented an aspect of the Sun-god. \r\rAsmadai; see IV. 168, where M. uses the form Asmodeus, now \rgenerally employed (and perhaps most familiar through Le Sage\'s work, \rLe Diable Boiteux}. Editors refer to the account of Asmodeus in \rthe Book of Tobit v. (see 221 23). \r\rIn the systems of demonology popular in the i6th and iyth centuries \rAsmodeus held very high rank, and was a type of might; cf. "potent," \r366. Thus Heywood (Hierarchic, 1635) says that the fallen angels, \rlike the faithful angels, were divided into nine Orders, and that \rAsmodeus was head of the fourth Order (p. 436). Reginald Scot \r(Discoverie of Witchcraft, 1584) speaks of " Sidonay, alias Asmoday, \ra great king, strong and mightie" (Nicholson\'s ed., p. 321); and in \rthe Faust-book (1594), second part, we read of " Asmody a king mighty \rand puissant" (Thorns\' English Prose Romances, 1858, in. 319). \rThere can be no doubt that Milton was deeply versed in these mediaeval \rtraditions ; and this particular tradition as to the might and prowess of \rAsmodeus lends, I think, significance to the present passage. \r\rCompare Dante\'s use of non-biblical tradition, as where he places \ramong the denizens of his Inferno "that caitiff choir of the angels, who \rwere not rebellious, nor were faithful to God ; but were for themselves " \r(ill. 3739). " There is " (says the note in the " Temple " edition of \rthe Inferno, p. 34) "no mention of these angels in the Bible. Dante \revidently followed a popular tradition, traces of which may be found in \rthe medieval Voyage of St Brandan" (celebrated in Matthew Arnold\'s \rpoem). \r\r368. plate, armour made of solid pieces of metal ; mail, a sort of \rchain work. \r\r\r\r518 PARADISE LOST. BOOK VI. \r\r371. Ariel, \'lion of God\'; cf. Isaiah xxix. i (margin), where \rAriel seems to be a title of Jerusalem ; it is the name of one of the \r"chief men" whom Ezra summoned (Ezra viii. 16). Probably M. \rhas used the name merely because its meaning is so descriptive of a \rgreat warrior. \r\rArioch, \'lion-like\'; cf. Gen. xiv. i, Dan. ii. 14 (where Nebuchad- \rnezzar\'s " captain of the king\'s guard " is so called). That the name was \rapplied, possibly in Rabbinical writings, to some evil spirit, seems \rproved by Nash\'s Pierce Pennilesse, "great Arioch, that is termed the \rspirit of revenge " (Keightley, Life of Milton, p. 472). \r\r372. Ramiel, \'exaltation of God\'; whence M. took the name \r(or whether he coined it) is not known. "Milton\'s proper names \rare often chosen for their full sounds" (Tennyson). \r\r373. / might relate. A skilful way of closing this particular \raccount. \r\r374. eternize, make eternal in fame, immortalise ; rather a favourite \rword with the Elizabethans. Cf. 2 Henry VI. v. 3. 29 31 : \r\r" Now, by my faith, lords, \'twas a glorious day : \rSaint Alban\'s battle won by famous York \rShall be eternized in all age to come." \rSo in The Faerie Queene, i. 10. 59, and The Teares of the Muses, 582. \r\r374, 375. elect Angels ; cf. in. 136, note. True fame is of Heaven \ralone (Lycidas, 78 84). \r\r379,. 380. See I. 36175, v. 658, 659, notes. \r\r387. deformed, hideous, Lat. deformis. \r\r390. charioter ; for the form cf. " pioner " (i. 676). \r\r391 96. what stood-, unlike that which "lay overturned," 390. \rThe sense is \' such part of the army as had not been laid low, now \reither retreated, all along the line of the Satanic host (which scarce offered \rany resistance), or fled in utter disorder.\' Orderly retreat and panic- \rstricken flight are contrasted. \r\r399. cubic, four-square ; not an exact use of the word, but editors \rcompare Milton\'s Reason of Church Government, "as those smaller \rsquares in battle unite in one great cube, the main phalanx." Masson \rtakes cubic literally, arguing that as the angels are not subject \rto the law of gravitation they can form a cube or any other solid \rfigure. \r\r404. unobnoxious, not liable ; a Latinism. \r\r405. though... moved. "This circumstance is judiciously added \rto prepare the reader for what happens in the next fight" (Newton). \r\r407. inducing, bringing on ; exactly Horace\'s jam nox inducere \rtcrris \\ umbras .. .parabat (Satires i. 5. 9, 10). \r\r\r\rNOTES. 519 \r\r410. the foughten field \\ an old ballad-phrase. It occurs in \rHenry V. iv. 6. 18, 19 : \r\r"As in this glorious and well-foughten field \r\rWe kept together in our chivalry ! " \r\rIt is one of the old-world phrases revived by Tennyson; cf. The \rComing of Arthur : \r\r"Then quickly from the foughten field he sent \rUlfius and Brastias and Bedivere \rHis new-made knights to King Leodogran"; \r\rThe Holy Grail, and The Princess, v. -287. He uses foughten also \rsimply as a poetic variant form= fought : \r\r\'* And ever since the lords \rHave foughten like wild beasts among themselves," \r\rThe Coming of Arthur. \r\r413. Cherubic... fires , i.e. the "flaming Cherubim," 102, to whom, \rthroughout P. L., falls the duty of sentinels. \r\rCf. the description of the sword "which turned every way" \r(Genesis iii. 24) in xn. 592, 593, 643. \r\r415. i.e. far removed into the dark, dislodged\', cf. V. 669. \r\r421. too mean pretence, too mean ambition: they aimed at some- \rthing better than mere liberty. Shakespeare uses pretence^-\' design, \rambition\'; cf. Coriolanus, I. 2. 20. So M. in u. 825. affect ; see \rv. 763. \r\r429. of future ; cf. phrases like \'of late,\' * of old.\' \r\r447. Nisroch ; the Assyrian deity in whose temple Sennacherib \rwas murdered by his sons, 2 Kings xix. 37, Isaiah xxxvii. 38. Reginald \rScot says (Discourse on Devils, p. 435), "Nisroch signifieth a delicate \rtentation"; but probably it means \'great eagle.\' \r\r455. i.e. against those who cannot be pained (cf. 404, 405) or suffer. \rCf. Dryden, speaking of the ghosts in Hades, " Forms without bodies \rand impassive air," ^Zn. vi. 409. \r\r458. remiss; used in the literal sense of Lat. remissus, \'slack, \rrelaxed, languid.\' \r\r462 64. A sentiment " suitable enough to a deity of the effeminate \rAssyrians " (Newton). \r\rIn the reference to "pain" there may be a personal glance; see \rxi. 542-46. \r\r465. offend =. ;Lat. offendere, \'to strike, hit.\' \r\r467, 468. to me deserves ; i.e. in my opinion he deserves no less \rgratitude than we owe to Satan for our deliverance. Cf. to in phrases \rlike \'to my thinking,\' \'to my knowledge,\' \'to my mind,\' all found in \rShakespeare. \r\r\r\r520 PARADISE LOST. BOOK VI. \r\r470. Editors show that the notion that cannon were invented in \rHell is found in Ariosto\'s Orlando Furioso, ix. 28, The Faerie Quetnc, \rI. 7. 13, and Drayton\'s Polyolbion, 18. \r\r478. crude, in their raw (Lat. crudus], un wrought state ; cf. 511. \r\r479. spiritous ; so the original editions ; there seems no need to \rchange it to \' spiritm^us.\' The materials, he says, "contain spirituous \rand fiery particles (cf. 483) which, if they be melted, will foam up \rout of them " (Keightley). \r\r481. ambient light. Cf. VI I. 89, and Shelley\'s Alastor: \r\r"every sight \r\rAnd sound from the vast earth and ambient air \rSent to his heart the choicest impulses." \r\r482. nativity, native state (or place), the deep, the under- \rground. \r\r495. i.e. to be despaired of, exactly Lat. desperandus ; cf. I. \r660. So Macbeth, v. 8. 13, "despair thy charm." \r\r496. cheer, spirits ; generally high spirits, joy, but not always ; cf. \rShakespeare, Sonnet 97, 13, "so dull a cheer," and Marlowe\'s Faustus, \rxin. 61, "I go, sweet Faustus, but with heavy cheer." Properly cheer \rmeans face, from O. Fr. ofo\'<fr?=Late Lat. cara, \'face\' ( = Gk. ndpa, \r* head \' ?) ; and some editors think that it has that sense here. \r\r498. and each, i.e. " admired " = \' wondered.\' \r\r501 506. thy race, Adam\'s. Probably M. is thinking of the Civil \rWar. Descriptions of civil strife and its incidents must have appealed \rwith the force of personal experience to many of his readers. The same \rthing is felt in reading Bunyan\'s Holy War. \r\r502. in future days. "This speaking in the spirit of prophecy \radds great dignity to poetry" (Newton). He compares jEneid IV. \r625, and adds : " this, here, very properly comes from the mouth of an \rAngel." \r\r507509. The abrupt style is "admirably contrived to express \rthe hurry of the Angels " (Newton). \r\r512. Cf. " nitrous powder " in iv. 815. \r\r513. found; surely the preterite of find; but it has been taken as \rfound \' to melt or cast metals.\' That scarcely suits "foam"; moreover, \rfounded (cf. I. 703) would be required. \r\r514. concocted and adusted, baked and dried. \r\r518, 519. engines, i.e. cannon. When cannon were first used, the \rballs were made of stone, not iron; cf. the allusion to "gunstones" in \rHenry V. I. 2. 282, with the passage from Caxton\'s Chronicles quoted \rby Steevens "[he] lette make...grete gonne stones for the Dolphynne \rto play wyth all." It should be remembered that gun originally meant \r\r\r\rNOTES. 521 \r\ra sort of catapult for throwing stones. Cf. Selden\'s Table- Talk, LXXVI. : \r"The Word Gun was in use in England for an Engine, to cast a thing \rfrom a Man, long before there was any Gun-powder found out." \rincentive reed, i.e. the gunner\'s match, incentive, enkindling. \r\r520. pernicious... to fire, so full of destruction as to kindle viz. the \rpowder. Newton takes pernicious =!*&. pernix, \'quick\'; but could \rthe word bear this meaning? M. elsewhere (cf. 849) always uses \rit =\' fraught with destruction\' (Lat. perniciuni). \r\r521. See v. 139. conscious, i. e. that witnessed what they did ; Hume \raptly cites Ovid, Metamorphoses xm. 15, quorum nox conscia sola cst. \r\r528, 529. dawning hills ; "great Rarities, " said Bentley, and read \r"downs and hills." Many of his proposals justified Pope\'s sneer at \r" Thy [i.e. of Dulness] mighty Scholiast, whose unwearied pains \r\rMade Horace dull, and humbled Milton\'s strains." \rSee Tennyson, CEnone : \r\r" I waited underneath the dawning hills, \rAloft the mountain lawn was dewy- dark, \rAnd dewy-dark aloft the mountain pine." \r\r535. i.e. the swiftest-winged Cherub. Zophiel, \'spy of God. J M. \rseems to have invented the name appropriately, since the Cherub is \rone of the scouts sent out (529). \r\r539. so thick a cloud. Cf. "cloud... of war" in the Sonnet to \rCromwell, where editors quote Vergil\'s phrase nubes belli JEneid X. 809. \r\r541. sad, steadfast, sectire, without fear. \r\r542. Cf. Horace\'s Martem tttnica tecttim adamantina, Od. I. 6. 13. \r\r543. 544. gripe i cf. iv. 408, XI. 264. orbed, circular; cf. 254. \rThe shields were held either straight out from the body, or high to \rprotect the head (Masson). \r\r546. barbed with fire, i.e. arrows with fire at their points; cf. \rShelley, Adonais, 99, "And dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek," \ri.e. piercing. Cotgrave explains fieche barbette by " a bearded or barbed \rarrow." A barb is a hook or jag on an arrow-head. \r\r547 49. Most modern texts have a semicolon after themselves \rand a comma after impediment reversing the original punctuation. \r\rimpediment-, cf. Lat. impedimenta, \'the carriages and baggage of \ran army.\' The good angels are not encumbered, like their enemy, with \rartillery. \r\rtook alarm, sprang to arms ; this was a current phrase ; cf. \rBunyan, The Holy War : "Now, Diabolus and his men being expertly \raccustomed to night-work, took the alarm presently [at once], and were \ras ready to give them battle as if they had sent them word of their \rcoming" ("Temple" ed., p. 267). \r\r\r\r522 PARADISE LOST. BOOK VI. \r\r550. move; there is no authority for moved \\ but it is tempting, all \rthe verbs being in the past tense. \r\r553. Cf. Henry V. ill. Prologue, 33, "the devilish cannon." \rtraining, dragging, Fr. trainer. \r\r558 67. The irony and verbal quibbles "discharge," "touch," \retc. are too obvious to need comment. This scene of the introduction \rof artillery can scarce be reckoned among the great achievements in \rParadise Lost. Humour is not Milton\'s forte: and are there not signs \rin what follows of some want of care? e.g. in the involved lines 571 \r78, and in 579 81, where stood occurs three times. \r\rAddison considered this part " the most exceptionable in the whole \rpoem " (i.e. open to exception), on account of these quibbles. \r\r560. composure^" composition" in 613, i.e. agreement, settlement. \r\r571 78. The sense appears to be: \'We saw a row of brazen or \riron pillars at least things which but for their hollow mouths we should \rhave supposed to be pillars (for they were very like them).\' \r\r576. iron. ..mould. M. may have recollected the description of \rSir Artegall\'s page, " His name was Talus, made of yron mould" (The \rFaerie Queene, v. i. 12). mould, substance. \r\r578. hollow, i.e. deceitful, as applied to "truce"; but there is a \rquibbling reference to the hollow barrels of the guns. \r\r580. stood, i.e. a "reed" stood. Some think that M. dictated \rheld, or some such verb, to which Seraph would be the subject. \rsuspense, in suspense, Lat. suspensi. \r\r581. amused, musing, wondering (cf. 623) ; the original sense cf. \rCotgrave, " to amuse, make to muse or think of, to gaze at." Fr. amuser \ris a compound of a and O. Fr. muser, \'to gaze at, muse over.\' \r\r582. at once, simultaneously. It seems best to make all the \rsubject to put, and to mark this by placing at once within commas : \r\' all did it, and did it simultaneously.\' Some editors take all at once \ras a single adverbial phrase ; but this is repetition after sudden, and \rleaves put without a subject. \r\r584. nicest, most exact, accurate. \r\r586. Newton compares Othello, in. 3. 355, 356. \r\r587. embowelled, filled. \r\r589. glut, i.e. the ammunition wherewith they were charged. \r595 97 Cf. 65661.

The Hind and the \rPanther, III. 316 19: \r\r" Constrained to quit his cause, no succour found, \rThe foe discharges every tire around, \rIn clouds of smoke abandoning the fight ; \rBut his own thundering peals proclaim his flight." \rSo in Marvell\'s The First Anniversary, 361, 362 : \r"An hideous shoal of wood Leviathans, \rArmed with three tire of brazen hurricanes." \r\r609 27. The two speeches are full of obvious quibbles. \r\r620 27. Newton notes that the speech is appropriate to the \rcharacter of Belial as drawn in the first two books of the poem ; that it \rcould not come from the statesman-angel Beelzebub or the fierce \rwarrior-angel Moloch. There Belial was described as a god of the \rtmwarlike (i. 493 502), himself "timorous and slothful" (ll. 117), and \rhere, in the great battle, "we find him celebrated for nothing but that \rscoffing speech" (Addison). \r\r622. urged home, i.e. thoroughly, to the full effect ; frequent in \rShakespeare; cf. King Lear, III. 3. 13, "revenged home," and III. \r4. 1 6, "I will punish home." \r\r625, 626. Cf. Twelfth Night, in. i. 89, and The Two Gentlemen of \rVerona, II. 5. 28: " Speed.

The Bard, \r11, 12 : \r\r" As down the steep of Snowdon\'s shaggy side \r\rHe wound with toilsome march his long array." \rSimilar is Lat. horrens or horridus applied to woodland scenery. \r\r665. jaculation, l^a&.jacidatio, \'a casting, hurling.\' Addison com- \rpares the classical legends about Pelion and Ossa in the Giants\' war. \r\r668, 669. Cf. II. 99396. \r\r670. On the first day the struggle of the angels only makes Heaven \rresound (217, 218); now it threatens to wreck the whole fabric of \rthe Empyrean. \r\r673. i.e. guiding all things, directing the Universe. M. seems \rto use "sum of things " = the summarum summa of Lucretius (v. 362), \ri.e. the All, the Universe. "The All" and " this All " (r65e TO irav \rTimaus 37 D) are favourite phrases of Drummond for the Universe. \r\r\r\r524 PARADISE LOST. BOOK VI. \r\rCf. Spenser\'s Hymne of Heavenly Beautie describing the creation of \rthe Universe, 41, 42: \r\r"And, last, that mightie shining christall wall, \r\rWherewith he hath encompassed this All." \r674. advised, advisedly, purposely. \r\r679. assessor, i.e. the sharer of his throne lit. \'one who sits by.\' \rThis literal use occurs in Tennyson\'s Queen Mary, i. 5 : \r\r" He slew not him alone who wore the purple, \r\rBut his assessor in the throne." \r\r681, 682. i.e. in whose face that which is invisible namely, what \rI by Deity am is visibly beheld. Cf. Colos. i. 15, "Who is the \rimage of the invisible God." So in P. L. III. 138 42, 38487, \rviz. 192 96, X. 63 67. M. expounds the idea in The Christian \rDoctrine, i. 5 (P. W. IV. 14245). \r\rinvisible,., beheld visibly; an instance of oxymoron. invisible\', \rapparently a noun = \' the invisible thing.\' \r\r691, 692. suspend^ delay. The sense is \'Though sin has done \rthem some harm, yet it has not made them so inferior to the good \rangels that the latter can win a decisive victory.\' \r\r695. " Within the compass of this one book we have all the variety \rof battles that can well be conceived. We have a single combat, and a \rgeneral engagement " under many phases (Newton). And, as in Homer, \rthe "battles still rise one above another, and improve in horror" \r(Addison). \r\r698. the main, the whole "continent" (474) of Heaven, or the \rwhole Universe.

Newton says " Milton, by continuing the war for three days, \rand reserving the victory upon the third for the Messiah alone, plainly \ralludes to the circumstances of his death and resurrection." M. was \rnot alone in dividing the struggle into three parts. The Schoolmen \rwho discussed most things discussed the point how long the contest \rlasted, and (writes Reginald Scot) "the greatest number affirme that... \rit stood with God\'s justice to give them [the rebellious angels] three \rwarnings ; so as at the third warning Lucifer fell downe like led to the \rbottom of hell," Discourse, Nicholson\'s ed., p. 423. Another point \ris M. has assigned the overthrow of the rebels to Messiah, whereas \rin Rev. xii. 3 9 it is implied that Michael was their vanquisher ; \rcf., however, verse n on which M. may have based his view. In any \rcase it belonged to the scheme of his work to make the Messiah the \rsubduer of Satan in Heaven, as on earth : the first victory foreshadows \rthat later one by which Paradise Lost became for humanity Paradise \rRegained. \r\r749 59- This description of the throne-chariot of the Deity \r(IV. 973 76, VII. 218 20), and of the Cherubic Shapes whereby it \rwas convoyed, is modelled very closely on Ezekiel\'s Vision, chap. i. \rM. has worked in detail after detail of the Scriptural original, and \rthe whole chapter should be compared with his narrative. Paradise \rLost contains no more striking instance of his skill in adapting \rScripture to the purposes of his work. With 752 cf. vii. 204. \r\r756. beryl, a kind of crystal. Fr. driller, whence brilliant, represents \ra corruption of Lat. beryllus Gk. (3rjpv\\\\os. careering, darting; the \rmetaphor of a tournament. Cf. I. 766. \r\r758. sapphire throne ; cf.

Concerning the much-discussed Urim, it seems to be agreed \rthat they were certain material objects placed inside the breastplate of \rjudgment which formed part of the high priest\'s ephod (Exod. xxviii. \r30) ; and that they were a means by which, through him, the will of \rJehovah was ascertained. It has been variously suggested that these \robjects were (i) diamonds and other precious stones, (2) metal slips \rmarked with affirmative and negative answers, (3) small images like the \r\' teraphim.\' M. (cf. P. R. in. 1315) takes the first view, so that the \rgeneral sense is \'armed in celestial equipment wrought of precious \r\r\r\r526 PARADISE LOST. BOOK VI. \r\rstones * ; cf. 364, and the passage from An Apology for Smectymnuus, \rquoted at 831 ("arming in complete diamond"). Tennyson seems to \rfollow this idea, where he describes (The Coming of Arthur, 297, 298) \rKing Arthur\'s sword Excalibur as \r\r" rich \r\rWith jewels, elfin Urim, on the hilt," \ri.e. mysterious precious stones placed there magically. \r\rThat famous Elizabethan book, Reginald Scot\'s Discovericof Witch- \rcraft (1584), speaks of the Jews being "informed by Urim: so as \rthe preests by the brightness of the twelve pretious stones conteined \rtherein, could prognosticate or expound anie thing " (bk. IX. chap. v. \rp. 139, Nicholson\'s ed.). \r\rThe word Urim is said to mean * light \' whence the view that the \rUrim were of Egyptian origin, and connected with the symbol of light \rworn by members of the priestly caste in Egypt ; or \' revelation \' cf. \rthe rendering of it in the Septuagint, 17 S^Xoxris, and in the Vulgate, \rdoctrina. In The Reason of Church Government, I. 5, Milton \rspeaks of "the oracle of urim" and "the judgment of urim," P. W. \r\r455- \r\r762, 763. Cf. the personification of Victory in Richard III. V. \r3. 79, "Fortune and Victory sit on thy helm" (i.e. helmet). So \rExpectation was personified, 306. Todd quotes Richard II.

" And [they] said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, \rand hide us from the... wrath of the Lamb," Rev. vi. 16. The irony of \rthe lines, in view of 639 66, is obvious. \r\r86466. Cf. I. 4449, 169 77, P. R. I. 90, 360, 361. The \r"bottomless pit" is the lowest region of Hell that "fiery gulf" on \rwhich the angels are depicted as tossing in I. 52. In the Doctrine and \rDiscipline of Divorce, 3, M. calls it "that uttermost and bottomless gulf \rof chaos, deeper from holy bliss than the world\'s diameter multiplied " \r(P. W. in. 224). Similar allusions to "the bottomless pit" occur in \rThe Tenure of Kings (end), Areopagitica, and Of Reformation in \rEngland, n. (P. W.

The same brief \rsentences, and solemn pauses, may be observed in the fine moral \rinstruction which the heavenly messenger gives Adam, at the close of \rthe eighth book " (Todd). \r\r899. There is a ring of Milton in Pope\'s couplet (Essay on Man, \rI. 127, 128) : \r\r"Aspiring to be gods, if angels fell, \rAspiring to be angels, men rebel." \rSee ix. 685712, note. \r\r900. he who ; him would have been more regular. But he \rsounds more emphatic, and the context requires strong emphasis \r(Dunster). \r\r900906. These lines give the two main motives of Satan\'s resolve \rto ruin mankind, namely, envy and desire to spite God by marring his \rcreatures : man shall be ruined that Satan may be revenged on the \rMost High for his defeat (iv. u, 12). \r\r907. Cf. P. R. i. 397, 398 ; Satan is the speaker : \r\r" Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain \r\rCompanions of my misery and woe ! " \r\rIt is the sentiment expressed in the proverbial line of unknown origin, \rsolamen miseris socios habuisse doloris (or malorum). So Shakespeare, \rLucrece, 790, 791 : \r\r"And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage, \r\rAs .palmers\' chat makes short their pilgrimage," \rand Romeo and Juliet \', in. 2. 116.

See X. 126 28. \r\rSir Thomas Browne gives the idea a moral turn : " Delude not \rthyself into iniquities from participation or community, which abate the \rsense but not the obliquity of them. To conceive sins less or less of \rsins, because others also transgress, were morally to commit that natural \rfallacy of man, to take comfort from society, and think adversities less \rbecause others also suffer them" (Christian Morals, I. xviii.). \r\r909. thy weaker; Eve, "the weaker vessel," i Pet. iii. 7. \r\r\r\rBOOK VII. \r\ri 39. With this exordium compare I. I 26; III. I 55; IX. \ri 47. All four passages mark a significant stage in the development \rof the story, and in each passage the notion implied in "above the \rOlympian hill I soar" finds expression. The first serves as prelude to \rthe whole poem and indicates the subject ; the second transfers the \rscene of the action from Hell to Heaven, and later to the Earth ; \rthe third is a pause before the history of Creation is unfolded; and \rthe fourth prepares us for the Temptation and Fall of Man. Compare \rHomer\'s method of stopping to invoke the Muse afresh before some \rgreat event is narrated. Pope parodies this epic convention in the \rArgument and (very Miltonic) first lines of the fourth book of The \rDunciad. \r\rWe may note in these four passages the number of personal allu- \rsions, e.g. to Milton\'s consciousness of the greatness of his subject \r(i. 12 16, 2426, in. 54, 55, vn. 1215, ix. 1319, 4143); his \rblindness (in. 21 55, vn. 27); loneliness (vn. 28); and advanced \ryears (ix. 45). \r\ri . descend from Heaven ; cf. Horace\'s descende calo, . . Calliope Odes \rill. 4. i, 2.

M. had ascended far higher, into \rthe Heaven of the Almighty. \r\r5. "Urania" means \'the Heavenly one\' and it is on a Heavenly \rpower that he calls, not on the classical Muse named \'Urania.\' See \rpp. 68688. \r\rIn this book of Paradise Lost the classical influence, which pre- \rdominated in the last, naturally gives way to the Biblical (Genesis) ; the \rsubject being the Creation. \r\r6. nor of\', understand art from the verb in the next line. \r\r7. old; often in M. almost a title of reverence; cf.

M. quotes the verse in Tetra- \rchordon (P. W. III. 331) and substitutes "playing" for "rejoicing" \r(Newton). \r\r9. eternal Wisdom.

There \rare similar allusions in S. A. ; see 697 700, with notes. \r\r26. The verbal repetition gives an effect of pathos ; cf. S. A. 80, 81. \rNote how he inverts the order of the words ; cf. 184 87. \r\rPerhaps the most remarkable example of the poetic device of \rrepetition in Paradise Lost is IV. 641 56. It is a favourite artifice \r(expressive of great emphasis) with Tennyson, from whose works many \rstriking illustrations might be quoted, e.g. the passage in Enoch Arden \rbeginning "The splendour on the waters," and the description of the \rdescent of the Grail in the Holy Grail, 473 76, where each line \rcommences with " blood-red." In the Marriage of Geraint five \rconsecutive lines start on the same note : \r\r"Forgetful of his promise to the king, \r\rForgetful of the falcon and the hunt, \r\rForgetful of the tilt and tournament, \r\rForgetful of his glory and his name, \r\rForgetful of his princedom and its cares." \r\revil tongues. M. had many bitter enemies among the Royalist \rparty ; as was only natural considering the attitude which he had \radopted towards Charles I. in The Tenure of Kings and Eikonoklastes. \rJohnson (not always a friendly critic of the poet) grimly remarks that \rMilton himself had " never spared any asperity of reproach or brutality \rof insolence" in his polemical writings against Salmasius and others. \r\r27.

BOOK VII. \r\rof Andrew Marvell (see pp. 365, 366) and some other influential friends \rhe was eventually allowed to take advantage of the Act of Oblivion \r(1660), yet he must for a time have felt insecure. After the pub- \rlication of his great work his position was different. He was, says \rBurnet, "much visited by all strangers, and much admired by all at \rhome, for the poems he wrote... chiefly that of \' Paradise Lost.\'" \r\r28. solitude. It has been justly said of Milton that throughout his \rlife as a whole he " was aloof and solitary beyond any other great \rEnglish writer." Cf. Wordsworth\'s famous description of him ("Thy \rsoul was like a Star, and dwelt apart "). \r\r29. nightly. Cf. in. 29 32 and ix. 2124 (notes). "The poet \rmight here remember the nightly vision of Beatrice to Dante, Purgatorio, \rxxx. 133" (Todd). \r\r30. purples, dyes with rosy hues. \r\r31. Cf. Horace, Satires I. 10. 74, contentus pauds lector ibus. As \rto the reception accorded to Paradise Lost on its publication see the \rIntroduction. Johnson says : " The sale, if it be considered, will justify \rthe public.... The call for books was not in Milton\'s age, what it is \rat present [1779 1781]." He notes that between 1623 and 1664 there \rwere only two editions, perhaps one thousand copies in all, of the \rworks of Shakespeare. \r\rPart of this line (31) is quoted by Wordsworth in the opening of \rThe Recluse, and the outline of his subject that follows is full of the \ratmosphere of Paradise Lost. \r\r32 38. Cf. the similar allusion in Lycidas, 58 63, to the classical \rlegend that Orpheus was torn to pieces, and his head thrown into the \rriver Hebrus, by Thracian women in their Bacchanalian orgies, his \rmother Calliope, the Muse of epic poetry, being unable to do aught for \rhis defence. See Ovid, Metamorphoses xi. i 55, Vergil, Georg. iv. \r517 27; and cf. A Midsummer- Nigh?* Dream, v. 48, 49 : \r"The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals, \r\rTearing the Thracian singer in their rage." \r\rNo doubt M. intends a comparison between the " wild rout " (a con- \rtemptuous word) of Bacchanals and the dissolute court of Charles II., \rand perhaps hints (cf. "dangers," 27) that he himseh may suffer like \rOrpheus. Other passages in his poems which probably refer to the \rcourt are I. 497, P. R. II. 44 48, 183 ; see also the notes on S. A. \r1418, 1605 1607. \r\r34. J^hracian ; Orpheus lived in a cave in Thrace. \r\r35. Rhodope, a mountain range in Thrace; the Hebrus on the \rbanks of which Orpheus was killed rises in Rhodope.

The name Lucifer, \' light-bringer \' (Gk. 0o><r06/)os), is properly \ra Latin title of the morning-star, but it was applied by patristic writers \rto Satan, in allusion perhaps to the tradition of the original "brightness" \rof his person. Cf. the common misinterpretation of Isaiah xiv. 12 \r(" How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer"), where "thou" refers \rto " Babylon," not to Satan, and the Hebrew word translated "Lucifer" \rshould be rendered "day-star," as in the Revised Version. \r\rMilton says that " Lucifer" and " Satan" were the names given to \rthe arch-rebel after his expulsion from Heaven : what he was called in \rHeaven we do not know. See I. 361 75, note, and v. 658, 659. In \r\r\r\rNOTES. 535 \r\reach of the early drafts of Milton\'s contemplated drama of Paradise \rLost the name " Lucifer," not " Satan," is assigned to him. No doubt, \rMilton substituted "Satan" as more distinctively Scriptural. \r\r13-2. \'Bright as Lucifer\' was almost a proverb like \'proud as \rLucifer.\' Cf. Marlowe\'s Faustus, V. 155 : \r\r" beautiful \r\rAs was bright Lucifer before his fall." \r\rThe old Faust-book says: "Lucifer [i.e. Satan] was so illuminated \rthat he far surpassed the brightness of the sun, and all the stars." This \rbrightness was dimmed after Satan\'s fall (l. 97, 591 99, IV. \r\r8 35 4> 8 7o)- \r\r134. Cf. I. 45, and the familiar lines in Henry VIII. in. 2. 371, \r\r372: \r\r" And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer, \r\rNever to hope again." \r\rCf. also Absalom and Achitophel, 273, 274. In the Areopagitica M. \ruses this image in mentioning (ad fin.} the downfall of the Court ("she \ris now fallen from the stars with Lucifer "). The " Fall of Lucifer" is \rone of the subjects of the York and Chester Miracle-plays. \r\r135. his place, the place prepared for him, viz. Hell; cf. Acts \ri. 25. \r\r136. Saints, i.e. the Heavenly beings who had remained loyal. \r\r137. "And, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the \rthrone," Revelation iv. 2. Cf. 556, 585, 586. \r\r139. Thyer suggested At last as the true reading. \r\r141. Cf. v. 643, note. \r\r142. us dispossessed\', an absolute construction ; cf. "him destroyed," \rIX. 130, "me overthrown," S. A. 463. In Shakespeare, as now, the \rabsolute case is the nominative ; but in older English it was the dative. \rMorris quotes Wyclif, Matthew xxviii. 13, "Thei han stolen him us \rslepinge" an exact parallel to "us dispossessed." I believe that in \rsuch cases M. meant the pronoun to be the dative and that he some- \rtimes employed this old idiom (with pronouns) as suggesting the Latin \rablative absolute more than the nominative absolute does. Thus, " me \roverthrown" has more of a Latin sound than "/ overthrown." He \ralso uses the nominative absolute with the present participle. \r\r143. fraud, crime, sin ; so Lat.fraus is used. \r\r144. Cf. v. 710. whom their place; cf. Psalm ciii. 16, "and the \rplace thereof shall know it no more."

"There are no limits to Chaos [=\'the Deep\'], because I \rwho fill it am infinite ; and it is not vacuous or empty, because I am \reverywhere in it, though I only exhibit my goodness in a limited space, \ri.e. in Heaven " (Keightley\'s note). \r\rI am, i.e. " boundless " = infinite. "Immensity and Infinity" are \ramong the "attributes" of the Almighty on which M. discourses in \rThe Christian Doctrine, I. i. \r\r175. the Filial Godhead, the divine Son (vi. 722); an abstract \rexpression for a concrete seems specially appropriate when divine \rpowers are spoken of.

Of course, Chaos has no centre \ror pole. \r\r216. "A magnificent line " (Tennyson).

For the word-order cf. 17, 270, 323, 477. See note on I. \r\r733- \r\r232. Milton\'s account of the Creation must be compared with \rGenesis i., ii. He follows the Scripture closely, especially where the \rAlmighty speaks, but supplements it, giving free scope to his imagina- \rtion (Newton). See also Ovid, Metamorphoses I. \r\r233. unformed, formless ; see V. 471, note. \r\rdarkness. In n. 961 63 he speaks of Night as the consort of Chaos \rand co-ruler of his realm, personifying them as spirits : an allegory by \rwhich we are to understand that the \' \' Abyss," i.e. Chaos, is a region \rof gloom. It is so represented in the poem always. See Genesis i. 2. \r\r\r\r538 PARADISE LOST. BOOK VII. \r\r23437.

Now atoms (semina rerum] of a like nature \rare brought together so as to form a solid substance. \r\rI believe that by this process M. means us to understand the forma- \rtion of the Earth, and that in what follows, "the rest. ..disparted," he \rrefers to the formation of the outer crust which encases the whole \rUniverse. The air is diffused "between" the central Earth and this \rcrust = the Primum Mobile. \r\rThe rhythm of the passage seems to me to prove that founded and \rconglobed are past tenses, not participles. They are in antithesis to \r"Jluidmass " ; and conglobed also gives a contrast to " matter unformed" \ras it implies that the Earth, at first without form, now is moulded into \ra spherical form : cf. V. 649, "this globous Earth." \r\r239. founded; from Lat. fundare, \'to lay the foundation of; \reditors compare Psalm Ixxxix. u, Proverbs iii. 19. \r\r240. the rest, i.e. the matter which had not been used to form \rthe Earth, several ; with the idea \' each thing to its own place.\' \r\r241. disparted, separated in different directions (dis-}. \r\rsptin out\\ the metaphor of a spindle drawing out the wool on a \rdistaff. \r\r242. self-balanced.

So in his Religio Laid, i, 2 : \r\r" Dim as the borrowed beams of moon and stars \r\rTo lonely, weary, wandering travellers." \r\rDante applies the same term "mirror " (specchio) to the sun, because \r"he receives the divine light from above, the spheres intervening, and \rreflects it downwards," i.e. according to Dante\'s cosmology (note in the \r"Temple" edition of the Purgatorio, p. 46). \r\r378. none\', emphatic as coming last; cf. iv. 675, 704, XI. 612. \r\r379. aspect, position (an astronomical term).

Cf. too the \rEssay on Man, in. 105 109 : \r\r"Who bids the stork, Columbus-like, explore \rHeavens not his own, and worlds unknown before? \rWho calls the council, states the certain day, \rWho forms the phalanx, and who points the way?" \rA passage (\'* When the cranes," etc.) in Somerville\'s Chase illustrates \rthe immense influence of Milton\'s diction on the i8th century, poets. \rCrabbe, describing the flocks of wild-fowl passing over the east coast of \rEngland, says (The Borotigh, I. 220 23): \r\r" Far as the eye can glance on either side, \rIn a broad space and level line they glide : \rAll in their wedge-like figures from the North, \rDay after day, flight after flight go forth." \r\r428. caravan, troop ; probably the word then had something of its \roriental associations. \r\r429. 430. " After a little time the bird that forms the apex or point \r[of the \' wedge \' or angle] quits it and falls back, and another takes \rhis place" Keightley.

The alliteration (especially /.../) \rexpresses length. Cf. Comus, 340, " With thy /ong /e veiled rule of \rstreaming /ight." Matthew Arnold uses the same obvious effect in The \rScholar-Gipsy : " The line of festal light in Christ-Church Hall." \r\r482. minims, very small creatures. \r\r484. and added wings, and had wings as well as " snaky folds." \rFabulous winged serpents such as dragons are meant. \r\r485. parsimonious, thrifty ; used in a good sense, emmet ; in \r\rp - L - 35 \r\r\r\r546 PARADISE LOST. BOOK VII. \r\rorigin the same word as ant. M. recollected Horace\'s description \rof the ant hand ignara ac non incauta futuri (Satires I. i. 35). \r\r486. Cf. Vergil, speaking of bees, ingentes animos angusto in \rpcctore versant (Georg. iv. 83). Note that " large " is not a mere trans- \rlation of ingentes ; it implies wisdom ; cf. P. R. III. 10, and i Kings iv. \r29, "God gave Solomon... largeness of heart." M. generally lends a \rfresh turn to what he borrows. \r\r487. Milton shows his republicanism. \r\r490. It was a common belief of Milton\'s time that the working-bees \rwere female, the males being drones (so called from their droning buzz). \rCf. Pericles, II. i. 50, 51, "We would purge the land of these drones, \rthat rob the bee of her honey." \r\r493. Genesis ii. 19, 20. Cf. VI. 7376, VIII. 34254. \r\r495. Genesis iii. i.

M. treats man\'s "upright" (509) stature as a sign of his \rsuperiority to and authority over animals ; cf. IV. 288, 289, Conms, 52, \r53. One feels a suggestion of the old thought that the purpose of this \r"erection" of stature, peculiar to man, was "for to behold and look up \rtoward heaven"; see Sir Thomas Browne\'s Vitlgar Errors, iv. i, \rwhere editors quote Cicero, De Natura Deorum II. 56, and Ovid, \rMetamorphoses I. 84 86. \r\r508. sanctity of reason, the divine attribute of reason; cf. v. \r48690. \r\r509. front, brow ; ~L,o.\\.. frons ; as in n. 302. \r\r510. from thence, therefore, i.e. through the possession of these \rqualities. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 547 \r\r511. magnanimous, of lofty mind, to correspond with, so as to \rhold intercourse or \' be in sympathy \' with. \r\r517, 518. Lines 163 66, 170, 171, 192220, implied that the \rFather remained in Heaven while the Son was sent forth ; yet, in virtue \rof his "omnipresence" (168, 169, 588 90), the Father was present in \rthe new Universe no less than in Heaven. Cf. "let us make " (519). \r\r519 34. Genesis i. 26 31. \r\r528. Cf. Hebreivs i. 3, "the express image of his person" (Revised \rVersion "very").

That Adam was not created in Paradise, \rthe "Garden," but was taken there afterwards, seems implied by \rGenesis ii. 8, 15. See vm. 296 99. \r\r537. Cf. "delicious Paradise," iv. 132. \r\r541. all sorts are here ; cf. v. 337 47. \r\r544. thou diest. In x. 210, 211 we read how the sentence passed \rupon Adam is relaxed, and "the instant stroke of death... removed," so \rthat after his sin he is still suffered by the Almighty to live, but no \rlonger in Paradise. \r\r547. In the famous allegory in II. 648 870 Sin is represented as \rthe mother of Death. They are always in the poem introduced together, \rDeath attending Sin as "her shadow" (ix. 12). \r\r561. thou heard* st\', cf. Adam\'s own words, IV. 680 88. \r\r563. Even the planets, the \'wandering\' bodies (see vili. 128, 129, \rnote), stood still, stations ; so the First Edition; the Second has \rstation. \r\r564. pomp, procession. \r565 67. Psalm xxiv. 7. \r\r569 73. The Old Testament often speaks of Angels visiting the \rEarth, and in in. 529 37 M. says that there were two aerial paths \rfor their descent, one leading straight down from Heaven on to Mount \rSion, the other extending over the whole Promised Land. In The \rChristian Doctrine, I. 9, M. deals with the ministry on Earth of \rAngels. \r\r577 578. Cf. IV. 976, "the road of Heaven star-paved." \r\r579. the Galaxy, \' the Milky way \' ; called lactece plagce (\'the milky \rregions\') in Milton\'s poem In Obitum Prtzsulis Eliensis, 60.

Properly j/^/=\'that by which the sounds of wind instruments \rare regulated\'; hence =\' tone, notes.\' M. speaks of a "lute or soft \rorgan-stop waiting on elegant voices, either to religious, martial, or civil \rditties," On Education. A skilled musician himself, he uses musical \rterms often, and precisely. \r\r597. on fret, i.e. produced upon frets. "On stringed instruments \rthat have finger-boards, like the lute or guitar, the small pieces of \rwood or other material fixed transversely on the finger-board at regular \rintervals are called frets. The object they serve is to mark off the \rlength of string required to produce a given note. Frets correspond in \rtheir use with the holes in the tube of a wind instrument." Grove\'s \rDictionary of Music. \r\r599. unison, i.e. solo opposed to in chorus. \r\r599,600. incense.., fuming; set Rev. v\\\\\\. 3 5. Cf. XI. 17, 18. Milton \r"had seen their manner of incensing in the churches abroad" (Newton). \r\r605, 606. the Giant-angels; a comparison is implied between the \rrebellious Angels and the Giants of classical mythology who sought to \rexpel Zeus and the gods from Olympus, thy thunders; see the account \rof the battle in Heaven, vi. 83466. Cf. Dryden, The Hind and the \rPanther, II. 535 37 (from the noble passage on the Catholic Church) : \r"Still when the giant-brood invades her throne, \rShe stoops from heaven and meets them half-way down, \rAnd with paternal thunder vindicates her crown " ; \rwhere "giant-brood " is an echo of Samson Agonistes, 1247. \r\r617. "witness, let this World bear witness. \r\r619. the hyaline, " the glassy sea " = the Crystalline Sphere. Milton, \r"when he uses Greek words, sometimes gives the English with them, \ras in speaking of the rivers of Hell " (11. 577 83) Newton. Cf. 579. \r\r621, 622. M. refers more than once to the likelihood of the heavenly \rbodies being inhabited ; see vni. 153 58, and cf. the quotation from \rBurton\'s Anatomy of Melancholy in the note on vni. 14045. \r\r622, 623. thou knovfst their seasons ; a parenthesis, qualifying the \rsuggestion that the stars will be fit for habitation (i.e. in respect of \rtemperature) : the Angels do not know, but the Almighty does. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 549 \r\r624. nether ocean, i.e. " the waters under the firmament." \r628 30.

Indeed, though he accepts the \rPtolemaic system throughout the poem, he makes Raphael refer to it \rand its later developments in not very complimentary terms (77 84) \rand seems to lean towards the Copernican theory. Grotius in his \rAdamus Exul, the tragedy on the Fall of Man with which M. is \rthought to have been acquainted, makes an angel explain to Adam the \rastronomical system and laws of the Universe. \r\rSome striking parallels to Milton\'s words are presented by the \rchapter in Burton\'s Anatomy of Melancholy entitled "a Digression of \rthe Ayre" (n. 2. in), which is a review of then current systems and \rtheories of astronomers. Astronomy (in which, as in so many other \rthings, he really belonged to a past generation) evidently had a great \rattraction for Milton : hence the references to Galileo, the only one of \rhis contemporaries alluded to \'in Paradise Lost. And how significant \rin itself is the famous reference in bk. I.! "\'The Tuscan artist\' \rthat is the name which Milton gives to Galileo, as if to indicate that \rscience and art are in inseparable conjunction, as they were in his own \rperson, and in his own poetry" (Mackail). See I. 287 91, in. \r588 90, V. 261 63 (with notes), and the Areopagitica, P. W. II. 82. \rDante, too, and Tennyson (says another critic) " loved the stars." \r\ri 4. In the First Edition of Paradise Lost the two books which \rare now VII. and VIII. of the poem formed only one book ; and after \rthe line, "Aught not surpassing human measure, say" (vil. 640), came \rthe line (641), "To whom thus Adam gratefully replied." In the \rSecond Edition, when book vil. was divided into two books, M. added \rthe three lines, "The Angel ended. ..fixed to hear," to introduce \rbook VIII., and changed slightly what is now the fourth line of the \rbook. Cf. the similar alteration at the beginning of book xn., which \rin the First Edition formed one book with the present book xi. \r\ri, charming \\ in the strong sense \'laying under a spell, enchanting.\' \r\r\r\r5 SO PARADISE LOST.

We have the same idea again in ix. 103 107. \r\r19. numbered\', apparently = \' numerous\' (cf. vi. 229, and Cymbeline, \rI. 6. 36), unless M. has in mind passages like Psalm cxlvii. 4, " He \rtelleth the number of the stars." \r\r22. officiate, supply. \r\r23. opacous, dark, yielding no light; cf. 93 ("nor glistering"). \rpunctual, small, no bigger than a point (Lat. punctum}.

In Middle \rEnglish the present infinitive was marked by the inflection en ; when \rthis inflection became obsolete, to was used with the infinitive.

" wandering \rcourse" (126). The six meant are the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, \rJupiter and Saturn. The " seventh " planet is the Sun, according to \rthe Ptolemaic system ; but the Earth (129), according to the Copernican. \rShakespeare treats the Sun and Moon as planets. \r\r129. the planet Earth; he does not mean to state definitely that \rthe Earth is a planet ; he only hazards the supposition that she is. See \rthe quotation from Burton\'s Anatomy in the note on 14045. \r\r130. " The three different motions which the Copernicans attribute \rto the Earth are (i) the diurnal round her own axis ; (2) the annual \rround the Sun ; and (3) the libration, as it is call\'d, whereby the Earth \rso proceeds in her orbit, as that her axis is [always] parallel to the axis \rof the World" (Newton). \r\rThe third of these motions is the "trepidation talked," to which M. \rrefers in in. 482, 483, and which is there attributed to the Crystalline \rSphere, in accordance with the Ptolemaic system. Here it is attributed \rto the Earth, as the followers of Copernicus taught. \r\rOne of the points in Paradise Lost which Addison criticises ad- \rversely is Milton\'s " frequent use of what the learned call Technical \rWords, or terms of art," and he instances more particularly the \rastronomical terms. But Dante had set the example. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 553 \r\r131 40. \'You must attribute the three motions just mentioned \reither to several spheres moving in opposite directions and crossing each \rother obliquely (the Ptolemaic view), or to the Earth (the Copernican \rview). If you attribute them to the Earth, then you save the Sun his \rlabour, i.e. of revolving round the Earth; and you also get rid of \r("save") that wheel or "rhomb" called the Primutn Mobile, the \rmotion of which is supposed to cause the revolution of the nine inner \rspheres round the Earth in twenty-four hours. It is only a theory that \rthis wheel or "rhomb" exists, because it is too far off to be visible; \rand you need not believe in the theory, if the Earth revolves on her \raxis from west to east every twenty-four hours, and thus illuminates \rwith the Sun\'s rays one-half of her globe while the other half, being \rturned away from ("averse") the Sun, is covered with darkness. The \rtheory of the Primum Mobile was only invented to explain certain \rmotions which really may be due to the Earth. \' \r\r132. thwart, crossing ; cf. the verb thwart =\' to go across,\' iv. 557. \r\r134. nocturnal and diurnal rhomb ; alluding to its revolution in \rtwenty-four hours. "Wheel of day and night" at once varies and \rexplains the whole phrase, rhomb, wheel, Gk. p6/*/3os. " Wheel or \rwheels... throughout the Paradiso is used for the revolving heavens" \r("Temple" edition of Paradiso, p. 12). Cf. "the eternal wheels" \r(eterne rote], I. 64; see also xin. 12, xxn. 119. Pope borrowed \rDante\'s phrase, in the same sense ; cf. the Moral Essays, ill. 168. \rSir Thomas Browne in one of his bold astronomical metaphors compares \rthe " encyclopaedic and round of knowledge" with "the great and \rexemplary wheels of heaven "-(Vulgar Errors, " To the Reader "). \r\r137. fetch day, i.e. from the Sun. \r\r140 45. Cf. Burton, "If the Earth move, it is a Planet, and \rshines to them in the Moon, and to the other Planetary inhabitants, as the \rMoon and they do to us upon the Earth ; but shine she doth, as Galilie \r[Galileo], Kepler, and others prove, and then/^r consequens, the rest of \rthe Planets are inhabited, as well as the Moon" (Anatomy of Melancholy, \rninth ed., I. p. 385). He had previously (p. 383) referred to " that \rparadox of the Earth\'s motion, now (? 1621) so much in question." Some \rtheologians found support for it \\i\\Job ix. 6. The idea that the stars are \rinhabited is satirised by Bunyan, as a contemporary delusion or im- \rposture, in the introductory lines (" To the Reader ") to The Holy War. \r\r145. M. seems to have thought that the Moon is inhabited. Cf. \rIII. 459 62. Drummond mentions, but refrains from expressing any \ropinion about, the belief ; cf. A Cypress Grove : " Some affirm there is \ranother world of men and sensitive creatures, with cities and . palaces, \rin the moon" (Works, II. 250). her spots; see V. 419, 420. \r\r\r\r554 PARADISE LOST. BOOK VIII. \r\r148. other suns. "He seems to mean Jupiter and Saturn, whose \rsatellites had been discovered by Galileo. Though he knew them to be \rplanets, he might have regarded them as suns with respect to their \rattendant moons " ; so Keightley, followed by other editors, explains. \rBut Burton, speaking of the " Fixed Stars," says : " If our world [i.e. \rthe Earth] be small, why may we not suppose a plurality of worlds, \rthose infinite stars visible in the Firmament to be so many Suns, to \rhave likewise their subordinate planets? which some have held, and \rsome still maintain.... Kepler (I confess) will by no means admit that \rthe fixed stars should be so many Suns, with their compassing planets" \r{Anatomy of Melancholy, I. 386). That appears to me to be the \rtheory to which M. alludes. \r\r150. male, original direct light; female, reflected light; cf. \r" borrowed," in. 730. \r\r153 58. \'That there should be such a vast unpeopled space, \ronly made for the purpose of shining, and from each of its orbs only \rcontributing (so great is the distance) a mere glimpse of light to \rthis Earth which itself sends back light : this notion is open to \rdispute. \' \r\r157. this habitable, the Earth ; an imitation of the Greek phrase \r77 olKovufrr] (777), \' the inhabited world.\' \r\r159. i.e. whether the Copernican system or the Ptolemaic be \rright. \r\r163 66. It was objected to the Copernican theory "that if the \rEarth mov\'d round on her axle in twenty-four hours, we should be \rsensible of the rapidity and violence of the motion." M. has this \robjection in mind when he suggests that if the Earth does revolve, her \rmotion may be smooth and even, and that the atmosphere may move as \rwell as the Earth which would, of course, make the sense of motion \rless perceptible to us (Newton). \r\r164. inoffensive, not striking against anything, not colliding \r(Lat. inqffensus}. spinning, i.e. like a top. \r\r173. Cf. Wordsworth\'s Ode to Duty, 53, 54 : \r\r"Give unto me, made lowly wise, \rThe spirit of self-sacrifice." \r\r181. Intelligence; in Spenser "a frequent term for the celestial \rbeings " (Todd). See the Hymne of Heavenly Beautie, 84, and cf. \rDrummond, A Cypress Grove : "And if these [the "eternal habitation \rand throne " of the Almighty] be so dazzling, what is the sight of Him, \rfor whom and by whom all was created ; of whose glory to behold the \rthousand thousand part, the most pure intelligences are fully satiate, \rand with wonder and delight rest amazed ; for the beauty of His light \r\r\r\rNOTES. 555 \r\rand the light of His beauty are uncomprehensible" (Works, n. 277). \rIt is really a Dante word ; cf. the Convivio, ill. vi. \r\r!83 97. Some editors regard these lines as an objection against \rstudy of the difficult problems of physical science. I think rather that \rMilton protested against barren speculation of all sorts, and a spirit of \rexcessive enquiry in general ; cf. n. 558 69, note. \r\r194, 195. what is more, i.e. anything beyond that, fume, vanity; \rliterally \'smoke\' (L,a.t. fumus). fond, foolish, impertinence, irrelevance, \rthat which does not belong to or concern us. \r\r197. still to seek, always deficient, at a loss. See Comus, 366, note, \rand cf. the Utopia (Pitt Press ed., p. 131), "They do daylie practise... \rlest they should be to seek in the feate of arms," i.e. deficient in \rskill. \r\r205.

Sin, who kept the gates of Hell, after- \rwards opened them " with ease " to let Satan out, but was unable to \rclose them again (11. 871 89). \r\r243, 244. noise, i.e. of the outcast Angels, who for nine days after \rtheir fall from Heaven lay prostrate on the lake of fire in Hell \r(i. 5053). When they arose and had re-formed their scattered ranks \rthen (i. 66679) \r\r" Highly they raged \r\rAgainst the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms \rClashed on their sounding shields the din of war, \rHurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven." \r\rThose were the sounds of " furious rage " heard by Raphael.

But I think that it refers literally to the sweet- \rscented air, and is combined by a sort of zeugma with joy ; cf. I. 502, \r"flown with insolence and wine" (a similar combination of the literal \rcause with the abstract). \r\r268. went, walked ; a common Shakespearian use. Cf.

M. always describes the " garden of bliss," i.e. Paradise, as \rsituate on the level summit of a lofty hill, the steep slopes of which are \rcovered with trees and shrubs (cf. " woody "). It is a plateau or table- \rland of circular shape (304). See iv. 134 (note), 172 77. \r\rplain, flat (Fr. plain, \' level,\' Lat. planus). Cf.

Sir Thomas Browne, Religio Medici, I. xxxiii., \r"before his fall, man also was immortal." Many of the Fathers of the \rChurch taught the doctrine that Adam, if he had not sinned, would not \rhave died but been translated to Heaven. M. speaks doubtfully on the \rsubject (v. 493 505), and in The Christian Doctrine, i. 8, says, "it is \revident that God, at least after the fall of man, limited human life to \ra certain term " which implies that this limitation may have preceded \rthe Fall. \r\r337. purpose, discourse ; cf.

Raphael does not appear again in the poem; after the \rTemptation and Fall, a sterner Archangel (XI. 234, 235) is sent from \rHeaven to lead Adam forth from Paradise. \r\r\r\rBOOK IX. \r\rI 5. This introduction refers mainly to Raphael\'s colloquy with \rAdam in the four preceding books of Paradise Lost* We were told in \rthem how the Archangel came down to Eden, partook with Adam of \rthe "rural repast" which Eve prepared (v. 331 450), and then held \rlong "talk" with him; narrating the rebellion of Satan and his \r\r\r\rNOTES. 563 \r\rfollowers (v. 577907), the contest and their expulsion from Heaven \r(vi. i 892), and the Creation of the World (book vii.) ; explaining \rother points on which Adam asks questions (book vni.) ; and ad- \rmonishing him against his Enemy (vi. 900 12, vm. 635 43). \rRaphael is referred to several times in books v. vm. as Adam\'s \r"Angel-guest" (v. 328), "godlike guest" (v. 351), " Heavenly guest " \r(vii. 69, VIII. 646), and it is to him that the description in lines 2 4 is \rmeant to apply. \r\rThis book " has more story in it, and is fuller of incidents, than any \rother in the whole poem " (Addison). \r\r1. no more of talk, i.e. there will be no more of this friendly con- \rversation in the rest of the poem. In book XI. the Messenger sent from \rHeaven is not Raphael "the affable Archangel" (vii. 41), but the \rstern, warlike Michael, who has to announce to Adam and Eve their \rbanishment from Eden and to lead them forth. \r\rwhere Gad; understand from what follows some words like \'\'con- \rversed,\' * spoke. \' The reference is to book vm., where Adam says that \rthe Almighty gave him possession of the Garden of Eden, warned him \rnot to touch the Tree of Knowledge (vm. 31633), and then promised \rhim a help-mate in Eve (vm. 437 51). \r\r2. as with his friend.

Cf. the vision revealed to Adam in XI. 477 \r90 of the " diseases dire " that Eve\'s disobedience brought upon men. \r\r13 19. He means that as regards the "argument," i.e. subject, \rwith which it is now about to deal, his poem has an advantage over \rthe three great classical epics : (i) the Iliad, which commences with \rthe line " Sing, O Muse, the wrath of Achilles," and describes in book \r\r36-2 \r\r\r\r564 PARADISE LOST. BOOK IX. \r\rXXII. his pursuit of Hector ("his foe") thrice round the wall of Troy ; \r(2) the Odyssey^ which relates the wanderings that Odysseus ("the \rGreek ") experienced on his homeward journey after the Trojan war \rbecause Neptune was hostile to him ; and (3) the sEneid, which tells \rof the hostility of Juno to /Eneas, the son of Cytherea, i.e. Venus, and \rof his betrothal to Lavinia (daughter of Latinus, king of Latium), who \rhad previously been promised in marriage to Turnus. \r\rThere is a similar summary of the themes of the three classical epics \rin his Second Defence of the People of England , where he writes : " The \repic poet who adheres at all to the rules of that species of composition \rdoes not profess to describe the whole life of the hero whom he \rcelebrates, but only some particular action of his life, as the resentment \rof Achilles at Troy, the return of Ulysses, or the coming of /^Eneas into \rItaly," P. W. I. 299. It is remarkable, I think, how much more \rrepetition of thought and expression there is in Milton than in Shake- \rspeare. \r\rThis claim to moral, not artistic, superiority, as of Christianity over \rPaganism, occurs in the two other great passages of invocation in \rParadise Lost\\ cf. I. 12 16 and vn. i 12. In Milton\'s view the \rgreat poet is a teacher in the first place, a singer in the second, and \rhe seems to have regarded himself as literally an inspired teacher. \r\r"Wrath" (14), "rage" (16) "ire" (18) all point back to "anger" \rin line 10. " The anger that he is about to sing is an \' argument \' more \rheroic not only than the anger of men, of Achilles and Turnus, but than \rthat even of the gods, of Neptune and Juno. The anger of the true \rGod is a more noble subject than [the anger] of the false gods" \r(Newton). \r\r20. answerable\\ a style corresponding with the dignity of his \rsubject. \r\r21. my celestial patroness, i.e. the "Heavenly Muse" (Urania) \rwhose aid he invokes at the beginning of the poem (i. 6). Milton\'s \rreferences to this Muse of Sacred Song which gave him inspiration \rhave a reality that is lacking in the conventional poetical appeals to \rthe \' Muses.\' Cf. P. R. i. 817. \r\r22. nightly ; cf. 47. He elsewhere speaks of himself as best \rinspired at night or just at dawn ; cf. ill. 29 32 and VII. 28 30. \r\rThese personal touches have been condemned by some critics as \ralien from the impersonal elevation of epic poetry. " I cannot " (says \rNewton) "but own that an author is generally guilty of an unpardon- \rable self-love, when he lays aside his subject to descant upon his own \rperson. But that human frailty is to be forgiven in Milton ; nay, I am \rpleased with it. He gratifies the curiosity he has raised in me about \r\r\r\rNOTES. 565 \r\rhis person ; when I admire the author I desire to know something of \rthe man ; and he, whom all readers would be glad to know, is allowed \rto speak for himself. But this, however, is a very dangerous example \rfor a genius of an infirm order, and is only to be justified by success." \r\r24. The inverted stress (" easy ") in the first foot gives an easy \rflow of rhythm corresponding with the sense. \r\r25. since first, i.e. about 1640; some lines of Paradise Lost (iv. \r32 41) were written as early as 1642. \r\rthis subject for heroic song.

A mythical subject would not appeal to \rM. Probably one of his reasons for abandoning the story of King \rArthur, which he at one time intended to take as the subject of his great \rpoem, was that he found the story to be " fabled " and " feigned." His \rthree great poems all had a solid basis ; so had Lycidas, and perhaps \rComus in a minor degree (see Introductions to them). \r\r33. races and games. The allusion is to the classical poets ; cf. \respecially the description of the games in Iliad xxm. and j*Eneid v. \rM. makes the Angels who keep guard over the entrance to Paradise \r"exercise heroic games" (iv. 551, 552), but does not describe them, to \ravoid repetition of II. 528 38. Compare Johnson\'s comment : " There \ris perhaps no poem, of the same length [as Paradise Lost], from which \rso little can be taken without apparent mutilation. Here are no funeral \rgames, nor is there any long description of a shield " such as Homer\'s \rdescription of the shield of Achilles, and Vergil\'s of the shield of \r.^Eneas. Cf. line 34. \r\r34 38. The allusion is to the Italian poets e.g. Boiardo, Ariosto \rand Tasso and Spenser, who describe tournaments and scenes of \rchivalry. \r\r34, 35. tilting furniture, all the equipments of a tournament. \rimblazoned, with coats of arms portrayed on them.

It is, I \rsuppose, true that no great epic poem (unless Tennyson\'s Idylls of the \rKing be an exception) has been written, at any rate in English, since \rParadise Lost. \r\rIn his Life of Milton Johnson says : " There prevailed in his time an \ropinion that the world was in its decay.... It was suspected that the \rwhole creation languished, that neither trees nor animals had the height \ror bulk of their predecessors, and that everything was daily sinking by \rgradual diminution. Milton appears to suspect that souls partake of \rthe general degeneracy, and is not without some fear that his book is \rto be written in \'an age too late\' for heroic poesy." \r\rThe opinion to which Johnson refers (satirically, as might be \rexpected) " is said to have been first propagated by Dr Gabriel \rGoodman, Bishop of Gloucester, in a work entitled \'The Fall of \rMan, or the Corruption of Nature proved by Natural Reason,\' 1616" \r(C. H. Firth). Ben Jonson seems to allude to it in his Discoveries, XX. \r(Natura Non Effoeta) : "I cannot think Nature is so spent and decayed \rthat she can bring forth nothing worth her former years. She is always \rthe same, like herself; and when she collects her strength, is abler still. \rMen are decayed, and studies : She is not." The idea is glanced at by \rThomson, Spring, 307, 308. ^ \r\r44, 45. or cold climate. Here he touches on what was a lifelong \ropinion. Thus in his poem Mansus (1638) he apologises for his Latin \rpoems on the ground that his Muse was reared in the chill north ; \rwhile in the History of Britain he complains that the English lack \r"the sun [which] ripens wits as well as fruits " (P. W. v. 240). We \rfind the same idea in The Reason of Church Government, Preface to \rbook II. (" if there be nothing adverse in our climate, or the fate of \rthis age" i.e. adverse to the composition of a great poem), and in the \rAreopagitica ; see P. IV. II. 53, 479. Cf. Pope\'s Essay on Criticism, \rII., where he says that some people allow only foreign writers to have wit : \r" Meanly they seek the blessing to confine, \rAnd force that sun but on a part to shine, \rWhich not alone the southern wit sublimes, \rBut ripens spirits in cold northern climes." \r\r\r\rNOTES. 567 \r\rThe influence of climate on national character is a leading idea in \rGray\'s philosophic fragment The Alliance of Education and Govern- \rment. \r\ror years ; perhaps not far short of sixty. \r\rDuring the years that he was engaged over P.

In the intervening books, v. viil., there is \rvery little advance in the action of the poem, except that Adam receives \rwarning of his Enemy through Raphael. \r\r54, 55. At his first entrance into Eden Satan had overheard Adam \rand Eve speaking about the Tree of Knowledge and thus learned the \rone thing in which to tempt them and compass their ruin (iv. 408 \r\r535)- \r\rfraud; in the general sense \'deceit, guile\'; see 89, 285.

Originally all great circles passing through the poles \rwere called colures (:6Xoupot, \'curtailed\'); but the term was at length \rconfined to the two great circles drawn from the poles through the \requinoxes and the solstices respectively.

The rapid, rather abrupt style is meant, apparently, to \rindicate some displeasure on the part of Adam. \r\rNewton thought that Milton here had in mind the incident of his \rown wife\'s leaving him soon after their marriage. \r\r377. i.e. for all her submissiveness she has the last word. It is in \rthese side-touches that M. shows his own estimate of women. Indeed \rthe picture he draws of Eve in this book is not agreeable. She is \rself-willed ; easily flattered by the Serpent ; disobedient of command \r(780, 781); selfish enough to drag down Adam in her fall (831); \rdeceitful (877, 878); and so mean-spirited as to reproach him (1155 \r61). \r\r387.

In iv. 269 Milton uses the Englished form \rProserpin. \r\rOn the appositeness of the comparisons in 386 96 Pearce has an \rexcellent note. "She [Eve] was likened to the Nymphs and Delia in \rregard to her gait ; but now that Milton has mentioned her being \r\'armed with garden tools,\' he beautifully compares her to Pales, \rPomona, and Ceres, all three Goddesses like to each other [and to Eve] \rin these circumstances, that they were handsome, that they presided \rover gardening and cultivation of ground, and that they are usually \rdescribed by the ancient poets as carrying tools of gardening or hus- \rbandry in their hands." \r\r401, 402. i.e. to be returned and to have all things, etc. ; an instance \rof zeugma, \r\r409. hellish rancour imminent ; his favourite word-order ; cf. 5, \r1047, an( i see the note on I. 733. \r\r413. mere serpent.

No doubt, M. knew the long description \rof the \' Garden\' in The Faerie Queene, III. 6. 29 49, which Keats in turn \rfollowed in Endymion, n. The allusion is not uncommon in Elizabethan \rwriters. Cf. Ben Jonson, Cynthia\'s Revels, v. 3, "I pray thee, light \rhoney-bee, remember that thou art not now in Adonis\' garden, but in \r\r\r\rNOTES. 575 \r\rCynthia\'s presence, where thorns lie in garrison about the roses"; and \rGiles Fletcher, Christ\'s Victorie on Earth, 40, " Adonis\' garden was to \rthis but vayne." The chief classical authority for the legend is Pliny, \rNatural History xix. 19, where the gardens of Adonis and Alcinous are \rmentioned in the same sentence. \r\rrevived, i.e. after he was slain by the boar. According to the myth, \rthe prayers of Aphrodite (Venus) moved the gods of the lower world to \rallow Adonis to return to the earth every year and pass six months \rwith the goddess. Spenser treats the story as an allegory of the im- \rmortality of love, and says (The Faerie Queene, in. 6. 4648) that after \rhis restoration to life Aphrodite would not let Adonis descend to the \rnether world but kept him in the \' Garden\' : \r\r"There yet, some say, in secret he does ly, \rLapped in flowres and pretious spycery, \rBy her hid from the world, and from the skill \rOf Stygian Gods, which doe her love envy." \r\r440. renowned, i.e. through Homer\'s mention of him. \r\r441.

Some critics regard the \rSong of Solomon as an epithalamium on Solomon\'s marriage with this \rprincess. Addison could "not but take notice, that Milton, in the \rconferences between Adam and Eve, had his eye very frequently upon \rthe book of Canticles" (i.e. Song of Solomon). See v. 17 25, note. \r\rnot mystic. M. inserts these words as the allusion is to Scripture \rnot as before, to classical legend. Contrast "feigned," 439. \r\r445 54. Perhaps " only a narrative of what befell the poet in his \ryounger days, when living in his father\'s house in Bread Street, in the \rCity" (Keightley). Cf. the seventh of his Latin Elegies, where, speaking \rof his youth, M. says : \r\rEt modo qua nostri spatiantur in urbe Quirites \r\ret modo villarum proxima rura placent : \rlines which Cowper renders : \r\r"I shunned not, therefore, public haunts, but strayed \r\rCareless in city, or suburban shade." \r\rProbably the "public haunt" specially meant was Gray\'s-Inn Walk, \rthen the fashionable promenade, and not far from Milton\'s home. \r\rNo one can read Milton\'s works carefully without seeing that he \r\r\r\r576 PARADISE LOST.

His favourite season was spring, and his \rfavourite times of the day the very early morning (cf. 200, note, and \r447) and twilight (see IV. 598, 599). And, like his contemporaries, \rCowley and Marvell, he loved a garden (// Penseroso, 49, 50). "He \ralways had a garden where he lived," says Aubrey. At his ideal \rCollege, gardening is to be part of the course. Gardens, indeed, \rwere becoming the fashion : witness Evelyn and his Sylva. \r\rIn On Education M. does not forget the influence of Nature : "in \rthose vernal seasons of the year when the air is calm and pleasant, it \rwere an injury and sullenness against nature, not to go out and see her \rriches, and partake in her rejoicing with heaven and earth." \r\r445.

"He here enumerates all the transformed serpents of \rwhich antiquity had told, viz. those into which Cadmus and his wife \rHarmonia were changed in Illyria ; that which accompanied the Roman \rambassadors from Epidaurus to Rome ; and those which were regarded \ras the sires of Alexander the Great and of Scipio Africanus ; of which \rthe former [\'he\'] was said to have been Jupiter Ammon, the latter \rJupiter Capitolinus" (Keightley). \r\rnot those that... changed, i.e. not those serpents that changed into \rthemselves Hermione and Cadmus. This interpretation Keightley\'s \rseems the best ; but some editors insert a comma after changed, taking it in- \rtransitively and treating Hermione and Cadmus as in apposition to those. \r\rHermione ; the name usually given is Harmonia. The story how \rCadmus king of Thebes and his wife Harmonia came to Illyria and \rwere changed into serpents is told by Ovid in the Metamorphoses IV. \r562 602 ; a passage which M. seems to have had again in his mind \rwhen he described the final change of Satan, X. 511 32. The \rMetamorphoses was one of Milton\'s favourite books, according to his \rdaughter\'s statement (see Johnson\'s Life) ; just as, in Golding\'s transla- \rtion, it seems to have been a favourite with Shakespeare the source, \rprobably, of much of his knowledge of classical mythology. \r\r506, 507. the god, vEsculapius, the god of medicine, whose chief seat \rof worship was at Epidaurus. At the time of a great pestilence at Rome \rthe oracle of Delphi bade the Romans seek the aid of ^Esculapius j so \rthey sent ambassadors to Epidaurus and the god appeared to them in \rthe form of a serpent which accompanied them back and stayed the \rpestilence at Rome, where ^Esculapius was thenceforth worshipped. \rThis legend also is told by Ovid, Metamorphoses XV. 622 744. \r\r507 10. nor to which, i.e. nor those serpents into which Jupiter \rAmmon was changed and was seen (i.e. by mortals). \r\rThe story that Jupiter Ammon the "Libyan Jove," IV. 277, so \rcalled in allusion to his shrine in the Libyan desert was the father of \rAlexander the Great occurs in Plutarch\'s Life of Alexander. Dryden \ruses it, with obvious reference to this passage, in Alexander\'s Feast, \r2129. A similar fable represented Jupiter Capitolinus (i.e. of the \rCapitol) as the father of Scipio Africanus, the vanquisher of Hannibal. \rOlympias ; the wife of Philip of Macedon. \r\r\r\rP.

An allusion to the legend of the sorceress Circe who bewitched \rmen with magic drugs, and then by a touch of her wand transformed \rthem into animals (cf. "herd disguised") which she kept in subjection. \rCf. the account in Odyssey x. how Odysseus came to the island of JExa. \rwhere she dwelt, and how she changed some of his followers into swine. \rMilton represents Comus as the son of Circe and assigns to him the \rattributes of the enchantress. See Comus, 50 77. In Eikonoklastes, \r13, M. says that part of the nation is still bewitched with the \ridea of monarchy, "like men enchanted with the Circean cup of \rservitude." \r\r525. turret, towering, enamelled, smooth and variegated like \renamel.

Sir \rThomas Browne : "It hath seemed strange unto some, she [Eve] should \rbe deluded by a serpent, or subject her reason to a beast, which God \rhad subjected unto hers. It hath empuzzled the enquiries of others to \rapprehend, and enforced them unto strange conceptions, to make out, \rhow without fear or doubt she could discourse with such a creature, \ror hear a serpent speak, without suspicion of imposture," Vulgar \rErrors, I. i. The first two chapters of the Errors (1646) discuss the \r" Causes of Errors," from that of Adam and Eve onwards, and " what \rwe may call the intellectual and moral by-play of the situation of \rthe first man and woman in Paradise, with strange queries about it " \r\r\r\rNOTES. 579 \r\r(Pater). These chapters are very typical of Browne, and we may be sure \rthat Milton knew them. \r\r558. the latter I demur; \'as to the latter "sense," 554 I am \rdoubtful whether it was denied to brutes, for \' etc. Probably this is an \rexpression of Milton\'s own opinion; cf. vin. 373, 374. \r\r560, 561. i.e. thee I knew to be the subtlest beast ; because Raphael \rhad so described the serpent when speaking with Adam and Eve (vii. \r\r494 495)- \r\r563. of mute\', for this classical idiom cf. 712 and see iv. 153, note. \r\r575. roving the field ; cf.

So "roam" is transitive in I. 521. \r\r581. fennel; of which serpents were supposed to be fond; cf. \rPliny, Natural History vin. 41, xix. 56, XX. 95. He mentions the \rbelief that fennel causes snakes to cast their old skins. To this associa- \rtion with serpents it may have been due that fennel was an emblem of \rdissembling and flattering : whence Ophelia\'s offer of fennel (probably) \rto the treacherous Claudius "There\'s fennel for you" (Hamlet t IV. 5. \r1 80). In An Apology for Smectymnuus M. mentions another popular \rbelief, given by Pliny, that connects serpents with fennel: " Something \rI thought it was that made him so quick-sighted... now I know it was \rthis equal temper of his affections, that gave him to see clearer than \rany fennel-rubbed serpent" (P. W. in. 136). The snake was thought \rto refresh its sight in spring-time by rubbing against the fennel-plant. \r\r582.

Cf. Horace\'s tecum vivere amem, tecunt obeam libens \rOdes III. 9. 24. \r\r837. sciential, conferring knowledge, i.e. on those who partake \rof it.

In this rather far-fetched thought M. is really playing upon \rthe two senses of Lat. sapere, \' to taste \' and \' to have discernment, be \rwise\' both sapience (1018) and savour (through the French) coming from \rsapere. Newton quotes the same quibble from Cicero\'s De Finibus n. 8, \rnee enim sequitur ul cut cor sapiat ci non sapiat palatum. " Taste," e.g. \r\' man of taste,\' lends itself to the same sort of word-play. \r\r1026. for, instead of. \r\r1034. toy, caress. \r\r1042. Cf. Proverbs vii. 18. \r\r1046 52. Contrast the description of Adam\'s sleep (v. 3 5). \r\r1050. unkindly, not natural, fumes, vapours, as of intoxication \r(cf. 793) ; cf. Dryden, Aurengzebe : \r\r" Power like new wine does your weak brain surprise, \rAnd its mad fumes in hot discourses rise." \r\r1058. Shame ; personified, as in 1097. In the original editions the \rsense was obscured by the omission of a stop after shame. \r\r1058, 1059. h* covered\', cf. Psalm cix. 29, " Let mine adversaries \rbe clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own \rconfusion, as with a mantle." \r\rbut his robe uncovered more, i.e. Shame, till then unknown to them \r(iv. 313 1 8), made them conscious of their nakedness. The thought \ris worked out in The Christian Doctrine, I. 12. \r\r1059 62. Judges xvi. 4 20 ; cf. Samson Agonistes almost pa ssim. \rThere is a striking application of the story in the conclusion of The \r\r\r\rNOTES. 587 \r\rReason of Church Government, n. P. W. n. 506; cf. also the \rallusion in Eikonoklastes, 11. \r\rthe Danite\', cf. the description of Samson\'s father Manoah v& Judges \rxiii. 2, " a man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites," i.e. of the Tribe \rof Dan. \r\r1061. Some editors have put forward the view that here and in the \rthree lines of S. A. where the name occurs M. treated the second \rsyllable of Dalilah as short or unaccented, e.g. Dalilah, a scansion which \rseems to me as unpleasant as it is needless. The correct accentuation \ris Dalilah ( Dalilah), and the last two syllables may form a trochee \ror "inversion of rhythm" such as M. admits into any foot of his blank \rverse. Thus the present line, I think, runs \r\r"Of Phfl|iste|an Dajlilah, | and wak\'d," \rthe third foot having a light stress or accent. \r\rThe lines in S. A. in which the name comes are : \r"Was in the vale of Sorec, Da|Hla," 229: \r"Than, Da|lila| thy wife," 724 (a short verse): \r"The sumpjtuous Dajlila | floating this way," 1072. \rIn each verse the trochee is rhythmical and quite regular. \r\r\' Dalilah \' follows the first syllable of the Greek form ; the form in the \rAuthorised Version, \' Delilah,\' is nearer to the Hebrew. As printed in \rS. A. the name has no h, perhaps an intentional difference, M. being \rextremely particular where sound was affected. \r\r1064. s true ken; cf. The Comedy of Errors, I. 2. 45, "The clock \rhath strucken twelve upon the bell." The forms of the preterite and \rpast participle of strike vary greatly in Elizabethan English. \r\r1068. worm, serpent (vil. 476) ; cf. A ntony and Cleopatra, v. 2. \r243, 244, where Cleopatra asks for the asp or serpent to kill herself: \r" Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there, \rThat kills and pains not ? " \r\r10/9. the last, the worst, greatest ; cf. Lat. extremus, ultimus. \r\rof the first, i.e. lesser evils, which they may well expect, seeing that \rthey have already experienced the greatest of evils, viz. shame. \r\r1080 82.

Cf. iv. 245, 246. \r\rimpenetrable to star. Newton quotes Statius, Thebais x. 85, 86, ntilli \rpenetrabilis astro \\ lucus iners, which perhaps suggested Spenser\'s \rdescription of the grove " Not perceable with power of any starr," The \rFaerie Queene, I. i. 7.

Cf. poetic descriptions such as "sun-proof" applied to \rshade, e.g. in Peek\'s play David and Bethsabe : \r\r"This shade, sun-proof, is yet no shade to me." \rSo in Matthew Arnold\'s Church of Brou : \r\r"The hills are clothed with pines sun-proof." \r1088. brown, dark, cover me ; cf.

The reference is to the banyan-tree or Indian fig \r(Fiats religiosa or Indicd). Warton pointed out that M. has followed \rclosely cf. the numerous verbal similarities the account of this tree \rin Gerard\'s Herball, 1 597 (the standard Elizabethan work on botany), \rwhere it is called "the arched Indian Fig-tree." Gerard, who took \rhis information on the subject from Pliny, Natural History xn. 5, says : \r\r" The ends [of its branches] hang downe, and touch the ground, \rwhere they take roote and grow in such sort, that those twigs become \rgreat trees ; and these, being grown" up unto the like greatnesse, \rdo cast their branches or twiggy tendrels unto the earth, where they \rlikewise take hold and roote ; by meanes whereof it cometh to passe, \rthat of one tree is made a great wood or desart of trees, which \rthe Indians do use for couerture against the extreme heate of the \rsun. Some likewise use them for pleasure, cutting downe by a \rdirect line a long walke, or as it were a vault, through the thickest \rpart, from which also they cut certain loopholes or windowes in \rsome places, to the end to receiue thereby the fresh cool air that \rentreth thereat, as also for light that they may see their cattell that \rfeed thereby.... From which vault or close walke doth rebound such \ran admirable echo or answering voice.... The first or mother of this \rwood is hard to be known from the children." \r\rThe description of the size of the leaves of this tree " broad as \rAmazonian targe," 1 1 1 1 is due to the same source, Gerard reproducing \rPliny\'s mis-statement that foliorum latitude peltce effigietn Amazonia* \rhabet. The description is inaccurate as the leaves of the banyan are \rsmall : it is the banana or plantain-tree that has large leaves which \r" are used, on the coast of Malabar, in the same manner , as here by \rAdam and Eve" (Keightley). Pliny in describing the Ficus Indica \revidently united the characteristics of the banyan and banana, and \rapparently writers even later than M. repeat the confusion. The \rbanyan from its peculiar character is described in many early travels, \re.g. in Sir Thomas Herbert\'s (1634) and Tavernier\'s (1684). \r\rIt furnishes Sir Thomas Browne with a characteristic simile : we \rmust, he says, "bid early defiance unto mother- vices " (i.e. evil ten- \rdencies which lead to other evil): "Where such plants grow and \r\r\r\rNOTES. 589 \r\rprosper, look for no champain or region void of thorns ; but produc- \rtions like the tree of Goa \\Ficus Indica\\, and forests of abomination," \rChristian Morals, m. iv.

No doubt, an expression of Milton\'s own opinion. One \rof his sneers at Charles I. is that he was influenced so by his wife : \r"Examples are not far to seek, how great mischief and dishonour \rhath befallen nations under the government of effeminate and uxorious \rmagistrates ; who being themselves governed and overswayed at home \runder a feminine usurpation, cannot but be far short of spirit and \rauthority without doors, to govern a whole nation" (Eikonoklastes, 7). \rProfessor Firth has recently noted a curious, hitherto unremarked \rillustration of Milton\'s prejudice against women, viz. his treatment of \rBoadicea in his History of Britain. " Previous historians had regarded \rthe warrior-Queen as a national heroine ; he represented her merely as \ra virago, \' a distracted woman with as mad a crew at her heels.\' " \r\r1183. -women\', he may have dictated woman. \r\r1189. contest.

"The Divines... reckon up several sins as \rincluded in this one act of eating the forbidden fruit, namely, pride, \ruxoriousness, wicked curiosity, infidelity, disobedience, etc." (Newton). \rMilton has a passage to this effect in The Christian Doctrine, i. 1 1 \r(P. W. iv. 254,255). \r\r1 8. the Angelic guards, i.e. the Cherubim; cf. ix. 6r, 61, 156, \r\r157- \r\r19. by this\', cf.Jutius Ccesar, I. 3. 125, "And I do know, by this, \rthey stay for me." \r\r20. 21. had stolen entrance; as is described in IX. 69 76. \r29. i.e. to make appear accountable = to explain, justify. \raccountable ; in the sense \' that can be accounted for \' ; not, as \r\rmore often, \'liable to render account.\' \r\r32. his secret cloud.

Cf. the fuller allusion in in. 37881. \r\r33. "And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings \rand voices," Revelation iv. 5.

The proverbial form of phrase seems hardly to fit the \rcontext. For the proverb "omittance is no quittance" (i.e. you may \rleave a thing undone, but not have done with it), cf. As You Like It, \rill. 5. 133. \r\r54. as bounty, i.e. has been "scorned." Man had shown scorn of \rthe gifts of the Almighty by seeking something more which was for- \rbidden him. \r\r55 57. d.

The whole scene follows Genesis iii. 8 21 closely, the \rwords of the Scripture being worked into the text, just as in Shakespeare\'s \rRoman historical plays the language of North\'s Plutarch is constantly \rreproduced and in Tennyson\'s Idylls of the King the language of \rMalory\'s Morte Darthur.

" Her seed \rshall bruise," etc. \r\r"Here [182 90] is a manifest indication, that, when Milton wrote \rthis passage, he thought Paradise was chiefly regained at our Saviour\'s \rresurrection. This would have been a copious and sublime subject for \ra second poem. The wonders, then to be described, would have \rerected even an ordinary poet\'s genius; and, in episodes, he might have \rintroduced His conception, birth, miracles, and all the history of His \radministration, while on earth. And I much grieve, that, instead of \rthis, he should choose for the argument [\'subject\'] of his \'Paradise \rRegained \' the fourth chapter of Luke, the temptation in the wilderness ; \ra dry, barren, and narrow ground, to build an epick poem on. In that \rwork he has amplified his scanty materials to a surprising dignity ; but \ryet, being cramped down by a wrong choice, without the expected \rapplause " (Benlley). \r\rThe poet was an old man, and tired, when he set about the \rsecond epic, and wisely adapted his choice to his strength. \r\r1 83.

By " the rest" in 296 he means, \rI think, all such "solid" elements as are not included under "soil" in \r293 : the " slime," i.e. pitch, helps to bind these elements together : the \r"soil " may be conceived as coalescing more easily under the petrifying \rstroke of Death\'s sceptre. In 29698 the sense obviously is that \rDeath bound the elements together by means of his look and by means \rof the slime ; the manner of expression is rather strained, but, as it seems \rto me, quite Miltonic, the combination of an abstract word like "rigour" \rand a literal word like "slime" being somewhat similar to I. 502, \r"flown with insolence and wine." \r\r288. shoaling \\ apparently transitive; \'driving it in a shoal or \rbank.\' \r\r290. the Cronian sea, the Arctic Ocean ; from the Lat. name Cro- \rnium Mare (Pliny, Nat.

P. W. II. 69. \r\r292. Petsora, the Gulf of Petchora in the Arctic Ocean, at the \rmouth of the river of that name. M. speaks of the river " Pechora or \r\r38-2 \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST. BOOK X. \r\rPetzora," and of the town of the same name in his History of Moscovia, \rquoting as his authority the narratives of certain merchants of Hull who \rhad wintered in those parts in the year 1611. \r\r292, 293. the...Catkaian coast; commonly explained \'the coast of \rChina\' with doubtful correctness, however. Strictly \'Cathay\' was \ridentical with China, Cathay being a corruption of Kitai, the name by \rwhich China is still known- in Russia and in many Asiatic countries. \rBut formerly, till some time after 1600, the opinion prevailed that \r\' Cathay \' was a great region distinct from China, lying north of it and \rstretching right up to the Arctic Ocean ; comprehending, in fact, East \rSiberia. Cathay is marked so in many old maps, and its capital was \rsupposed to be Cambalu i.e. Cambalu was regarded as a different city \rfrom Pekin, the capital of China, though properly they were the same. \rI believe that this was Milton\'s notion of Cathay, from the references to \rit in the History of Moscovia and from the fact that in P. L. xi. 388 and \r390 he treats " Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can " and " Paquin [Pekin] \rof Sintcan kings " as two distinct cities. \r\rrich. In the History of Moscovia he touches several times on the \rwealth and trade of the cities of Cathay P. W. v. 407. Indeed the \rwealth of this mysterious land had become proverbial through the \rreports of travellers from the time of Marco Polo onwards. See \rchapter XX. in Mandeville\'s Voiage. \r\r294. mace, sceptre; cf. Henry V. IV. i. 278, "The sword, the \rmace, the crown imperial." Todd quotes from the play Dido, Queen \rof Carthage, by Marlowe and Nash, "like pale Death\'s stony mace" \r(n. i. 1 16, Bullen\'s ed., II. 320). Burke has a telling allusion to \rthis line in the Reflections on the Revolution in France, part II., \rsection V. "[he] will sooner thaw the eternal ice of his atlantic \rregions, than restore the central heat to Paris, whilst it remains \r\' smitten with the cold, dry petrifick mace \' of a false and unfeeling \rphilosophy" (Payne\'s ed., p. 288). \r\r296. Delos\', one of the Cyclades islands (v. 264, 265), in the yEgean \rSea. " According to a legend, founded perhaps on some tradition of its \rlate volcanic origin, it was called out of the deep by the trident [cf. \'as \rwith a trident,\' 295] of Poseidon [ = Neptune], but was a floating island \runtil Zeus fastened it by adamantine chains to the bottom of the sea, \rthat it might be a secure resting-place to Leto, for the birth of Apollo \rand Artemis."

Probably Milton here had in \rmind Genesis xi. 3, where the Hebrew word used for this bituminous \rsubstance is rendered \'slime.\' The substance is " petroleum hardened \rby evaporation and oxidation," and the lumps of it appear in the water \respecially after earthquakes. See again 561, 562, note; also I. 411, \rxii. 41, 42, notes. \r\r299, 300. deep to the roots... they fastened, i.e. laid the foundation of \rthe structure, mole, causeway = Latin moles , used of any massive \rstructure, e.g. a dam or pier. \r\rJohnson considered that M. had here assigned to Sin and Death \r"a work too bulky for ideal architects," i.e. too material for allegorical \rfigures. Addison had doubted whether " persons of such a chimerical \rexistence are proper actors in an epic poem," but showed that the \rreason why M. introduced them lay in the subject of his poem, i.e. in \rthe paucity of dramatis persona which it afforded. And he praised \rgreatly the allegory in book II., from the point of view of allegory. \r\r305. inoffensive, free from obstacles (Lat. inoffensus) ; literally, \'not \rcausing one to offend, i.e. stumble against\' (Lat. offendere). \r\r306. if great things...

Susa ; a Persian city of the province of Susiana and winter \rresidence of the kings of Persia ; see P. R. ill. 288. According to \rtradition, Susa was founded by Tithonus, the father of Memnon (see // \rPenseroso, 18), and Memnon built its acropolis, called after him the \rMemnonium. Susa is the Shushan of Esther i. 2 and Daniel viii. 2, \rpassages of which perhaps we have an echo in " Memnonian/a/ar^." \r\r310. bridging\', with the bridge of boats described by Herodotus \rVII. 36. See Mayor\'s notes on Juvenal x. 173 76. \r\r311. The reference is to the story told by Herodotus (vn. 35), that \rXerxes in his anger at the destruction of his first bridge by a storm \rordered the Hellespont to receive three hundred lashes from a " scourge" \rrpiriKOffias tiriKtffOat jucUrrryi irXrjyds and to have a pair of fetters \rthrown into it.

The original editions have no comma after " Chaos," and the \rconstruction intended might be " landed to the outside," i.e. on to ; but \rit seems better to regard the words "to the outside" as a kind of \rexplanation of "to the self- same place where " : taken thus, they define \rthe place. \r\r323. interposed, i.e. between "the confines" of Heaven and those \rof the World. The bridge from Hell touched the outer surface of this \rWorld at the point where (i) the stair from Heaven also touched the \rsurface, and where (2) the passage led down to the interior of the World. \rThe bridge therefore resembles the middle one of three roads which \rform a junction. \r\r327. in likeness, i.e. "disguised " (330), as in III. 634 44, 694. \r\r328, 329.

The literal idea of the noun paragon is \'a model, pattern\': \rhence the notions \' rival \' and \' comparison.\' Shakespeare uses the verb \r= \'to excel\' a natural extension of the sense \'rival\'; cf.

This passage is perhaps the most striking example of \ralliteration and assonance in the poem, the effect being designed partly \rto suggest to the ear the actual sound described, partly to convey to \rthe imagination a sense of the terror of the whole scene. Thus the \rrepeated sibilant represents the hissing; cf. I. 768, ix. 613. On the \rother hand, the repetition of sound in "dreadful," "i/in," "afire," \r*\'</rear" etc. seems to intensify the horror of the event.

An allusion to the legend \r\rthat as Perseus was bringing back the head of Medusa, one of the Gorgons, \rwho had hissing snakes instead of hair, drops of her blood fell on the \rsoil and caused the country to abound with serpents. Ovid touches on \r\r\r\rNOTES. 603 \r\rthe story, Metamorphoses iv. 613 19, while Lucan enumerates the \rkinds of serpents, and his account (Pharsalia ix. 70033) was probably \rin Milton\'s thoughts. \r\r5-28. Ophiusa ; the island of serpents = Gk. <50tou<r<ra, i.e. (50i6e<ra-a, \r\'abounding in serpents\'; a small island in the Mediterranean, to which \rthe Romans gave the similar name \' Colubraria,\' from coluber, \' a snake,\' \radder.

BOOK X. \r\r57 2 > 573 The original editions read: \r\r"Thus were they plagu\'d \r\rAnd worn with famin, long and ceaseless hiss." \rIt seems to me simplest to suppose that the printer misplaced the comma \rafter "famine " ; if we put it after " long," then " famine " and " hiss " \r(a noun) are balanced with their respective epithets, and the balance \rgives an admirable rhythm, while the turn of phrase " worn with famine, \rand hiss " is quite characteristic. Keightley printed : \r\r"Thus were they plagued; \r\rAnd, worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss"; \rtaking " hiss " as a verb. Other editors have followed him (some placing \ra comma instead of a semicolon after "plagued "). This interpretation \rappears to me to be open to several objections. It rather implies that \rthe "famine" was the cause of the hissing; involves a most awkward \rchange from the past tense in 572 to the present in 573 and then back to \rthe past in 574, and yields, surely, an unpleasant rhythm. \r\r575 77. No doubt, M. had some authority for this tradition, \rbut editors have failed to find it. The nearest approach to it known \rto Newton was the speech of the Fairy Manto in Ariosto\'s Orlando \rFurioso, XLIII. 98: \r\r" Each sev\'nth day we constrained are to take \r\rUpon ourselves the person of a snake" (Harrington\'s trans.). \rsome say ; a convenient phrase, under cover of which he can \rmention theories, yet avoid the responsibility of accepting them. Cf. \r668, 671, ix. 638. \r\r578. We must remember that according to the ordinary patristic \rand mediaeval belief which M. accepted (see Appendix, pp. 672 74), the \rfallen Angels became the gods of classical mythology : hence there might \rwell be among " the heathen " some tradition of the story of Eve and \rthe Serpent. So M. identifies the Serpent (Satan) with Ophion (cf. \rGk. Jtyus, \' a serpent \'), one of the Titans and the first ruler of Olympus ; \rand suggests that Eurynome, the daughter of Oceanus and wife of \rOphion, may have been the same as Eve. Newton showed that in the \rallusion to Ophion and Eurynome M. had in his thoughts a passage of \rthe Argonautica (i. 503 509) of Apollonius Rhodius. \r\r579. purchase, prey, i.e. mankind. In Comus, 607, "And force \rhim to return his purchase back," the first version (Cambridge MS.) \rhas "And force him to release his new got prey" \r\r581, 582. ivide-encroaching. "Some epithet should be added to \rEve to shew the similitude between her and Eurynome, and why he \rtakes the one for the other; and therefore in allusion to the name \rEurynome [ = \' wide-ruling\'] he styles Eve \' the wide-encroaching,\' as \r\r\r\rNOTES. 605 \r\rextending her rule and dominion farther than she should over her \rhusband, and affecting godhead " (Newton). \r\r584.

The legend \rthat Zeus (Jupiter) expelled Cronos (Saturn) from Olympus (i. 516, \rVII. 3, 7), the \'heaven\' of later classical mythology, and from sovereignty \rover gods and men, is touched on in // Penseroso, 30. \r\r586, 587. in power ; potentially. \r\ractual, the cause of an act, viz.

This speech is noticeable as not being so Biblical in \rcharacter as most of those which M. assigns to the Almighty. \r\r616, 617. M. seems to have had in his thoughts Julius Caesar, ill. \ri. 273, " Cry \' Havoc,\' and let slip the dogs of war." The phrase \'cry \r" havoc,\'" imitated from O. Fr. crier havot, was an old military term for \r\'giving no quarter,\' i.e. it was the signal for indiscriminate slaughter; \rso that " to havoc yonder world " was an even stronger expression then \rthan it is now. dogs of Hell \\ cf.

In The Christian Doctrine, I. 13, he says, "All nature is \rsubject to mortality and a curse on account of man " ; and that thought \ris the basis of this long passage dealing with the deterioration in the \rphysical Universe which followed the Fall of Man. The main Scriptural \rauthority for this thought which M. quotes is Genesis iii. 17, "cursed is \rthe ground for thy sake." The idea comes in Drummond\'s " Hymn of \rthe Fairest Fair," 26384 (Flowers of Sion).

Dr Masson explains : " It is poetically assumed here \rthat, before the Fall, the ecliptic or Sun\'s path was in the same plane as \rthe Earth\'s equator, and that the present obliquity of the two planes, or \rtheir intersection at an angle of 23^, was a modification of the physical \rUniverse for the worse, consequent upon the moral evil introduced by \rsin. But this physical alteration might be produced in either of two \r\r\r\rNOTES. 607 \r\rways : either by pushing askance the axis of the Earth the required \rdistance, leaving the Sun undisturbed ; or by leaving the Earth undis- \rturbed and compelling the Sun to deviate the required distance (\' like \rdistant breadth \') from his former equatorial or equinoctial path. To \rindicate what \' the like distant breadth\' would amount to, Milton follows \rthe Sun in imagination after his deviation from the equatorial line : \rtracing him, first, in his ascent north of the equator, through the constel- \rlations Taurus (in whose neck are the Pleiades, called the Seven \rAtlantic Sisters, as being mythologically the daughters of Atlas) and \rGemini (called \' the Spartan twins,\' as representing Castor and Pollux, \rthe twin-sons of Tyndarus, King of Sparta), up to his extreme distance \rfrom the equator at the Crab, in the Tropic of Cancer ; then returning \rwith him in his descending path by Leo and Virgo, till he again touches \rthe equator at Libra ; and, for the rest, simply suggesting his similar \rdeviation from the equator to the south by naming the Tropic of \rCapricorn as the farthest point reached on that side.... He [Milton] \rgives the larger space to the hypothesis of a change of the Sun\'s \rpath." \r\r671. the centric globe, the Earth, the centre of the Universe, \raccording to the Ptolemaic system. \r\r676. the Scales Libra (ill. 558). \r\r678, 679. He has previously said that before the Fall only one \rseason was known in Eden, viz. "eternal spring," iv. 268: a view \rheld by some of the Church Fathers. See also V. 394, 395. When \rDante reaches the Garden of Eden he is told (Purgatorio, xxvill. 142, \r143) : " Here the root of man\'s race was innocent ; here spring is ever- \rlasting, and every kind of fruit" (cf. V. 341). Classical mythology \rspoke similarly of the Golden Age ; see 7*he Advancement of Learning, \rII. so. 9, where editors cite Ovid, Metamorphoses I. 107 (ver erat \rceternum, etc.). \r\r680 84.

An allusion to the story of the revenge taken by Atreus, \rking of Mycence, on his brother Thyestes, who had wronged him and \rbeen banished : how " Atreus, pretending to be reconciled to Thyestes, \rrecalled him to Mycenae, killed his two sons, and placed their flesh \rbefore their father at a banquet, who unwittingly partook of the horrid \rmeal" (Classical Dictionary). This spectacle is said to have caused the \rsun to turn aside, and M. suggests that the feasting on the forbidden \rfruit worked a like effect. \r\rThyestean; I think that M. intended us to scan \' Thyest(e)an,\' eliding \rthe e of the termination, instead of accentuating it according to the \rcorrect rendering \' Thyeslean.\' Good critics, e.g. Mr Bridges, recognise \ra similar scansion in S. A. 133, " Chaly|b(e)an tem|per\'d steel, and frock \rof mail" instead of \'Chalybean.\' Dr Abbot scans \'Epicurean\' in \rAntony and Cleopatra^ II. i. 24, and says that "the Elizabethans \rgenerally did not accent the e in such words." \r\r689 91. i.e. the sun\'s course before the Fall must have differed \rfrom its present course : otherwise the World would not have escaped \rextremes of heat and cold then any more than it does now. \r\r693. sideral, of the stars (Lat. sidera). blast, i.e. blasting "influence." \r\r696.

In Milton\'s time the application of names to these distant \rregions was rather vague. \r\rthe Samoed shore, i.e. the shore of north-eastern Siberia, near the \rGulf of Obi in the Arctic Ocean.

The spirit, Adam is made to argue, constitutes life (cf. \r"pure breath of life") and the spirit alone "sinned": the body is mere \r" dust," a "clod," and as such " properly hath neither" life nor sin : \rtherefore "death," as the annihilation of life and punishment of sin, \rmust mean the death of the spirit. So the "end" (797) will be not \rmerely the dissolution of the mortal body into its dust but annihilation \rof the whole being "a// of me shall die." \r\rThe subject is discussed in The Christian Doctrine, I. 13. \r\r798 801. Cf.

Editors cite similar passages from other poets, in par- \rticular a close parallel from Milton\'s favourite writer Euripides, viz. \rHippolytus 616 et seq. See the chorus 1010 60 in S. A. \r\r898 906. The passage is like a commentary on the proverbial line, \r" The Course of true love never did run smooth," A Midsummer -Nighfs \rDream, I. i. 134. That M. when he wrote the lines was thinking of \rthe circumstances of his own first marriage cannot be doubted. \r\r904906. A personal allusion appears to be intended. Edward \rPhillips, the poet\'s nephew and one of his biographers, states that after \rMilton\'s first wife refused to live with him he paid much attention to a \rMiss Davis (possibly the lady addressed in his Sonnet "To a Virtuous \ryoung Lady ") ; so that " too late " represented his own experience. \r\rProbably "already linked, and wedlock-bound" refers to " he," and \r" fell adversary" to his wife, now a source of "hate or shame" to him; \rbut the sense might be that the man meets "his happiest choice" \rafter she is " linked" to his enemy, which state of things occasions \rhim " hate or shame." \r\r921. forlorn of; cf.

Michael had not yet been chosen for the discharge of any \rduty in the action of the poem, as had Gabriel (bk. IV.) and Raphael \r(bk. v.). But he had been mentioned in bk. vi. as playing a great part \rin the battle in Heaven, and it was natural therefore that some share in \rthe actual conduct of the story should be assigned to him (Newton). \r\rMichael\'s name occurs in both Milton\'s first lists of dramatis persona; \r(see the Introduction], whereas neither list has Gabriel or Raphael. \r\r105. remorse, pity; in Shakespeare the usual sense is \'pity, tender- \rness of heart.\' Cf.

Vergil, dZn. vn. 180, Janique bifrontis imago. \rIn the Areopagitica M. speaks of "the temple of Janus, with his two \rcontroversial faces," P. W. II. 96. Janus sometimes appears as quadri- \rfrons, i.e. with four faces. \r\r130 33. Argus, the hundred-eyed monster who was set by Hera \r(Juno) to watch over lo; some of his eyes watched while the others \rrested. Hermes (Mercury) soothed him to sleep with music, and killed \rhim. Cf. the fine passage describing the approach of Dulness, at the \rend of The Dunciad: \r\r"As one by one, at dread Medea\'s strain, \rThe sick\'ning stars fade off th\' ethereal plain ; \rAs Argus\' eyes by Hermes\' wand opprest, \rClosed one by one to everlasting rest; \rThus at her felt approach, and secret might, \rArt after art goes out, and all is night." \r\rDante describes the eyes of Argus as the pitiless eyes which could keep \rawake longer than others (Purgatorio, xxxil. 64 66). Milton applies \rthe story of lo watched by Argus in his treatise Of Reformation in \rEngland, II. (P. W.

Jonson, Love\'s Triumph : \r\r" The rod and serpents of Cyllenius (i.e. Hermes) \r\rBring not more peace than these"; \r\rand Sir Thomas Browne, Christian Morals, n. xiii. : "The Egyptians \rwere merciful contrivers, who destroyed their malefactors by asps, \rcharming their senses into an invincible sleep, and killing as it were \rwith Hermes\'s rod." \r\rKeightley notes that opiate is probably a reminiscence of Ovid, \rMetamorphoses i. 716, where the rod is medicata, i.e. steeped in drugs. \rThe word does not come elsewhere in M., except in the MS. of Comus, \r696, where "the Lady" calls the magic draught of Comus his helbrewd \r[i.e. Hell-brewed] opiate, for which M. substituted brewd enchauntmenls. \r\r133 36. meanwhile. This is the last day of the action of P. L., \rwhich Newton makes to cover eleven days. \r\r135. The Greek Leucothea, the white or bright (\\evK6s) goddess, \rwas identified by the Romans with their deity Matuta or Mater Matuta, \rthe goddess of the dawn.

In ix. 78284 (see note) Milton makes Nature "give \rsigns of woe " when Eve plucks the forbidden fruit ; and when Adam \reats thereof similar portents ensue, 1000 1004. Here the omens are \rsymbolical : the two birds and two beasts represent the human pair ; and \rthe direction of their flight " to the eastern gate " foreshadows the \rbanishment from Eden. Keightley notes that in /Eneid I. 393 Vergil \rmakes the number of swans twelve to denote the twelve vessels that had \rescaped from the storm. Wordsworth refers to this passage of Milton \rin his poem The Redbreast and Butterfly. \r\r183. eclipsed. An eclipse was traditionally of evil omen ; cf. I. \r597. In his History of Britain M. says, "The same year was seen an \reclipse of the sun in May, followed by a sore pestilence," P. W. v. 287. \rThe vessel in Lycidas was "built in the eclipse," 101. \r\r184 86. Cf. sEneid xil. 247 56, where the eagle, fulvus Jovis \rales, carries aloft the swan, and lets it fall again the incident being \rregarded as an omen by the armies. \r\r185. the bird of Jove ; cf.

It was a \rtechnical term in falconry; cf. The Taming of the Shrew, IV. i. 194. \rSo in the Essay on Man, in. 53, 54 : \r\r"Say, will the falcon, stooping from above, \rSmit with her varying plumage, spare the dove?" \r\rtour; so spelt in the First Ed., and some editors have thought that \rit means \' wheeling motion,\' from tour, \' a circuit.\' But it seems to me \rmore probable that M. meant tower ; it would be an effective descrip- \rtion, by metaphor, of the proverbially lofty flight of the eagle. Cf. \r1} Allegro, 43, where the lark sings " From his watch-/0vr in the skies." \rThat the spelling of tower is irregular in M. appears from comparison \rof II. 635, where the First Ed. has touring high (said of Satan\'s flight), \rwith P. R. n. 280, where the First Ed. has high towring (said of \rthe lark). \r\r190. eastern gate. Cf. xil. 638, 639, the words of which echo this \rverse. M. describes the gate in iv. 543 48. \r\r196. too secure, i.e. feeling too certain of. \r\r203 207. The brilliance is that of the Heavenly host led by \rMichael, which is descending on the western region of Paradise. \r\r205, 206.

"regal ornament," v. 280 (note). \r\r244. Iris had dipt the woof. Iris was the classical goddess of the \rrainbow, and the verse is a poetical way of saying that the vest was \rbrilliant as with the hues of a rainbow. M. had used the same fancy in \rComus, 83, where the Attendant Spirit speaks of his "sky-robes spun \rout of Iris\' woof." See, too, the first reading (1645 edition) in the \rNativity Ode, 143, 144. \r\rPope could blend Miltonic passages with great skill ; cf. his \raccount of the sylphs or air-spirits in The Rape of the Lock, u. \r6368 : \r\r" Loose to the wing their airy garments flew, \rThin glittering textures of the filmy dew, \r\r\r\r622 PARADISE LOST.

And let \rme add, that it was the more proper and necessary to repeat the words \rin this place, as the catastrophe of the poem depends so much upon \rthem, and by them the fate of Man is determined, and Paradise is lost " \r(Newton). He shows that the repetition of the words of messages and \rthe like is common in Homer. "Jupiter delivers a commission to a \rDream, the Dream delivers it exactly in the same words to Aga- \rmemnon, and Agamemnon repeats it a third time to the Council, \rthough it be a tautology of five or six verses together." \r\r264. gripe, seizure, spasm ; cf.

Parallels have been noted in Sophocles, Philoctetes 1453 \ret seq., and Euripides, Alcestis 244. But speeches of farewell are apt \rto have a family likeness. \r\r270. native, "for she had commenced her existence in Paradise" \r\r\r\rNOTES. 623 \r\r(Keightley) ; whereas Adam, created elsewhere, was placed in Eden. \rCf. vin. 300 et seq., and Gen. ii. 7, 8. \r\r272. i.e. to spend the time granted as a respite from that day. \r\r275. visitation; properly \'a visit,\' here \'the thing visited,\' i.e. \rthe flowers. Another example of Milton\'s use of the abstract for the \rconcrete, whether actively or passively (as here). \r\r278. rank, set in order: the metaphor, perhaps, of a general \rinspecting troops. Cf. Arcades, 59, where the Genius of the Wood visits \rhis plants " I... Number my ranks, and visit every sprout." \r\r290 92. Cf. xii. 615 18. The line bears some resemblance to \rthe passage in Lyly\'s Euphues which editors quote in illustration of \rRichard II. I. 3. 275 80, viz. "that every place was a country to \ra wise man, and all parts a palace to a quiet mind" (Plato). There is \rprobably a reference in xii. 646 to this scene in Richard II. \r\r293. damp, depression of spirits. We find the adjective in the \rsense * depressed\'; cf. I. 523. So the verb in the Areopagitica, \r"this [i.e. the censorship of books] was it which had damped the \rglory of Italian wits," P. W. II. 82. \r\r298 300. Cf. S. A. 1565 68, where the Messenger shrinks \rfrom telling Manoa (the father) the news of Samson\'s death. \r\r307. The jingle of sounds, knowing... known, suggests iv. 830, \rand S. A. 1081, 1082. \r\r309. ^vho all things can. The verb can, \' to know how to,\' i.e. \'to \rbe able,\' was not then, as now, a mere auxiliary. In Shakespeare it \rgoverns, but rarely, an accusative ; cf. The Two Gentlemen of Verona, n. \r\r4. 165, "all I can is nothing," and The Phoenix, "the priest... That \rdefuncti ve music can. " Perhaps these are accusatives of respect : e.g. \rhere the idiom may be \' who is powerful in respect of all things.\' \r\r310. weary. Cf. Horace\'s use vifaligare^ \' to importune,\' Odes I. \r2. 26. \r\r316, 317. Cf. passages like Psalms civ. 29, Ixvii. See xn. 106 \r109, and S. A. 1749. \r\r325, 326. For Adam the altars would serve as actual reminders (in \rmemory), for his descendants as memorials : it is the distinction between \rpersonal experience and historical tradition. But it seems to me possible \rthat the true reading is "in memory and monument," a single phase \rqualified by "to ages." Todd shows that the two words are often \rcombined, much in this way, and there are other places in M. where or \rappears to have taken the place of and through some error. Cf. \r\r5. A. 182, "To visit or bewail"; and again in 545 (" gods or men," \r2nd ed.) and 1653. Here the mistake might have been caused by the \rfact that the two preceding lines, and the following one, begin with the \r\r\r\r624 PARADISE LOST. BOOK XI. \r\rsame letter. Milton\'s blindness introduces an element of uncertainty \rin questions of text. \r\r"We find from various parts of the book of Genesis, that the \rpatriarchs raised altars, where God had appeared to them. See xi. 7, \rxii. 25. To this custom of the primitive and patriarchal ages Milton \rseems to have alluded" (note in Todd). \r\r33 2 > 333- Cf. Exodtis xxxiii. 23. Newton thought that 333 might \rbe an echo of Statius, Thebais xii. 817, Sed longe sequere et vestigia \rsemper adora. \r\r336 38. Psalm cxxxix. ; Jeremiah xxiii. 24; Acts xvii. 28, 29. \r\r339. gave... to... rule. Cf. I. 736, III. 243. \r\r347 5- M - always speaks of Eden as set on a hill ; cf. 282, 283, \rIV. 134 (note). \r\r356 58. Cf. Daniel x. 14, where the angel says to the prophet, \r" Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people \rin the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days." The whole \ridea of the vision was probably suggested to Milton by the vision of \rhis descendants vouchsafed to ^Eneas in the last book of the sEneid. \r\rJohnson says : " Of episodes, I think there are only two [in Paradise \rLost] contained in Raphael\'s relation [v., vi.] of the war in Heaven, \rand Michael\'s prophetic account of the changes to happen in this world. \rBoth are closely connected with a great action ; one was necessary to \rAdam as a warning, the other as a consolation." Addison had noted \rthat the " vision" in bks. xi., XII. is designed to modify the feeling of \rAdam\'s failure which the close of the poem leaves ; for though Adam \rhimself has fallen, yet " he sees his offspring triumphing over his great \renemy, and himself restored to a happier Paradise." \r\rThe "Mount of Vision" in The Dunciad, in., whence "Bays" (Colley \rGibber) surveys in a dream the realms of Dulness and her triumphs, is \rone of the most elaborate of the Miltonic parodies in Pope. \r\r366. mortal passage, passage from mortality; cf. Comus, 10, "after \rthis mortal change," i.e. after death. \r\r367, 368. Similarly M. "made Eve retire upon Raphael\'s be- \rginning his conference with Adam" in bk. vni. 40 44 (Thyer). \r\r369. Cf. VIII. 45277. \r\r374. obvious, i.e. turned to meet the evil. \r\r376, 377. Cf. Ezekiel viii. 3, and xl. 2, " In the visions of God \rbrought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high \rmountain." The phrase means \'visions sent by God\'; see xii. 121, \r6 1 1. One of Milton\'s subjects for a tragedy based on British history \rwas : " Edwin by vision promis\'d the kingdom of Northumberland on \rpromise of his conversion..." (Cambridge MSS.). \r\r\r\rNOTES. 625 \r\r380. the amplest ; the First Ed- omits the. \r\r381 84. that kill. Its name is not mentioned in Scripture. In \rP. X. in. 251 etseq. (the scene of the Temptation), Milton is thought to \rmean Mt Niphates (ill. 742) in Armenia. That passage should be \rcompared with the list of names here, where the geographical sweep, \rhowever, is much vaster. \r\r3884 1 1 . Many poets have delighted in the enumeration of proper \rnames Milton not least. Cf. i. 396411, 58287. Editors note \rthat "Tasso, whose Godfrey is no very imperfect model of a regular \repick poem, has in his fifteenth canto employed thirty or forty stanzas \rtogether, in a description of this sort; which had no necessary connec- \rtion with his general plan" (Newton). Collins borrowed the trick of \rOriental names ; cf. his Persian Eclogues, in. and iv. \r\r388. Strictly Cathay was identical with China, and Cambaluc, its \rcapital, was the same as Pekin (390). See X. 292, 293, note. In the \rAreopagitica M. writes Cataic, P. W. n. 69. \r\rCambaluc, built by Kublai Khan, was the capital of the Mongol \rEmperors of China, from about 1264 to 1368. The name is a corrup- \rtion of the Mongolian Kaan-Bahgh, < the city of the Khan,\' and Pekin \ris still called \'the city of the Khan\' by many Asiatic races. The \rname should be written and accented Cdmbdlnc : Cdmbalu, as M. and \rLongfellow have it, was a popular form, where the wrong accent was \rdue to the Italian version of Marco Polo\'s Travels (through which \rmediaeval Europe first heard of Cathay and Cambaluc) ; the French \r(i.e. the original) MSS. of the Travels give the correct accent \rCambaluc. \r\r389. Samarkand, in Central Russian Asia ; once the capital of \rTimur (i.e. Temir) whose grave is there. Its earlier name was Mara- \rchanda. It lies about 100 miles from the river Oxus. \r\rTemir, the great Oriental conqueror, Timur, the subject of Marlowe\'s \rtwo tragedies of Tamburlaine ; he lived 1336-1405. Commonly called \rTamerlane (a corruption of Timur i Leng, \' the lame Timur \') \r\r390- Payuin, i.e. Pekin, the capital of China. Paquin is the form \rHexham s Mercator; Heylyn writes it " Pequin or Pagnia." Sinatan- \r\rthe geographer Ptolemy calls the ancient inhabitants of China Since. The \rword appears to be a corruption of Tsm f the title of the great dynasty \rfrom which the country got its name Tsina (or China). \r\r391- These names represent India, Lahore being in the Puniaub \rwhile Agra is the capital of the N.W. provinces. ^P-/=Arabic \rMughal = Mongol. The real founder of the Mughal empire in India \rAkbar the Great (died 1603), made Agra his capital ; later the seat of \rgovernment was transferred to Lahore. The juggler in Jonson\'s \r\r40 \r\r\r\r626 PARADISE LOST. BOOK XI. \r\rMasque of Augurs says, in his affected English, that he can show the \raudience "de Tartar cham," and "de groat king of Mogull." \r\r392. Here the survey has passed to the East Indies, " the \rgolden Chersonese " being the peninsula of Malacca, " thought \rby some," says Heylyn, "to be Solomon\'s Ophir" ; but see 400, \rnote. \r\r393. Ecbatana (as M. writes in P. R. ill. 286), in ancient Media, \rwas the summer capital of the kings of Persia down to the Greek \rconquest (i.e. about 330 B.C.), as Susa was their winter residence. \r\r394. Ispahan, or Isfahan, became the capital of Persia in the reign \rof the Shah Abbas the Great, who ruled 1586 1628. It was very \rcelebrated in the i7th cent.; many European merchants and artificers \rsettled there. Heylyn (who writes Hispaan] says that the circuit of \rthe city-walls was nine miles. \r\r394> 395- Moscow (then the capital of Russia) is mentioned among \rthe Asiatic names because it was "considered as belonging to Asia in \rthe early part of the seventeenth century, and so included in the maps \rof Asia of that period " (Masson). One of Milton\'s last works was a \rBrief History of Moscovia ; the name of the city is there spelt Mosco. \rKsar is a corruption of Lat. Casar; hence identical with Germ. \rKaiser. \r\rSultan, i.e. of Turkey. Bizance = Byzantium, Constantinople. \r\r396. Turches fan- born. The Turkish tribe, which founded the \rOttoman empire, came from Central Asia (i.e. Turchestan), whence \rthey were driven by the Mongols early in the I3th century. \r\rnor could his eye not ken. The vision is directed now to Africa \rfirst on its eastern coast. \r\r397. 398. The empire meant is Upper Ethiopia (see IV. 282, note) \ror Abyssinia; Negus, \'king,\' was the hereditary title of the monarch of \rthe country. Ercoco, now generally spelt Arkeeko, is a port on the Red \rSea, at the northernmost (i.e. " utmost") point of Abyssinia. \r\r398. less, i.e. lesser than, inferior to, Abyssinia. \r\r399. Mombaza (or Mombas} and Melinda are on the east coast of \rAfrica, a little north of Zanzibar, Qutloa or Keelwa being a little south \rof it, on a small island. All three were then noted centres of trade, \rchiefly Portuguese. Heylyn speaks of the " commodius haven" of \rMelinda. \r\rIt may have been in Milton\'s thoughts that this part of the world \rwas not without poetical, indeed epic, associations, perhaps better \rknown then than now. For Camoens had described the voyage of \rVasco da Gama up the east coast of Africa, and some of Milton\'s \rreaders would know the Lusiads through the translation by Milton\'s \r\r\r\rNOTES. 627 \r\rCambridge contemporary and successor in the post of Latin Secretary, \rSir Richard Fanshawe. \r\r400. Sofala ; on the same coast, but further south ; won by the \rPortuguese in 1505, the district of Sofala still forms part of their \rcolonial province of Mozambique. M. is alluding to the town of \rSofala (lying on the island of Chiloane in the estuary of the river \rSofala) which in the i;th century was famous as a mercantile port. \rStrictly, the name should be accented Sofala, though M. makes \rit Sofala. \r\rOphir; whence Solomon\'s fleet brought gold and precious stones, \rI Kings\'. iS, x. n. According to Genesis x. -29, 30, Ophir was in \rsouthern Arabia, and not on the east side of Africa. One modern theory \rconnects it with Abyssinia. Speaking of Sofala, Heylyn says, "This \rCountry for its abundance of Gold and Ivry, is by some thought to \rbe that Land of Ophir to which Solomon sent" ; he rejects the view, \radding, " of this opinion Ortelius in his Thesatirtis was the first Author." \rAnother incorrect theory identified Ophir with the peninsula of \rMalacca; cf. Josephus, Antiquities^ vin. vi. 4, "Solomon gave this \rcommand, that they should go... to the land that was of old called \rOphir, but now the Aurea Chersonesus, which belongs to India, to \rfetch him gold." In Of Reformation M. alludes to the "mines of \rOphir" as proverbial sources of wealth, P. W. n. 418. Cowley has \rthe line, "Though Ophir\'s starry stones met everywhere her eye" \r(The Garden). The name came to be used as a synonym for pure \rgold; cf. Sir Thomas Browne, Christian Morals^ I. xxviii. : "There \ris dross, alloy, and embasement in all human tempers; and he flieth \rwithout wings, who thinks to find ophir or pure metal in any." He \rwas among those who identified Ophir with Malacca ( Vulgar Errors, \r\rII. 2). \r\r401. A glance at the map will show that the states of Congo and \rAngola (Portuguese since the i;th century) are on the west coast of \rAfrica, practically on a level with Quiloa. \r\r402. thence, i.e. still keeping to the west coast. \r\rThe Atlas Mountains are a range in northern Africa, between the \rGreat Desert and the Mediterranean, their chief heights being in \rMorocco and Algiers. \r\r403. 404. The five territories here mentioned formed part of the \rcountry vaguely called Barbary, the seaboard of which lay along the \rMediterranean, and westwards was bounded by the Atlantic. There \ris still a small town of Fez in Morocco ; its name, says Heylyn, is an \rArabic word for gold. Sus, or Susa, is now Tunis. \r\rMarocco; spelt so in the First Ed., both here and in I. 584. Heylyn \r\r40 2 \r\r\r\r628 PARADISE LOST. BOOK XI. \r\rmentions a town of Tremisen (with a province of the same name) lying \rinland to the south of Algiers. \r\r403. Almansor, \' the victorious,\' calif of Bagdad ; he reigned \rfrom 754 to 775 ; his conquests extended over the whole of North \rAfrica. \r\r405. He just glances at Europe "as concentrated all in all in \rRome " (Masson) of which, and of her empire, there is an elaborate \rdescription in P. R. iv. 31 85. \r\r406. in spirit, i.e. not with his eyes, because America was on the \ropposite side of the globe (Newton). \r\r407. Monteznme; spelt Motezume in the First Ed. The ordinary \rform Montezuma is the Spanish form of the Aztec name Moteuczoma. \rM. is referring to the Emperor Montezuma, subdued by the Spanish \rgeneral Cortes, 1519 20. \r\r408. Cusco, i.e. Cuzco, in the centre of Peru (the word Cuzco meaning \r\'centre\'); it was formerly the capital of the empire of the Incas, whose \rlast native sovereign, Atahuallpa in the Spanish form, Atabalipa was \rconquered by the Spaniard, Pizarro, 1532 33. \r\rricher ; in the lines Ad Patrem M. glances (94) at the Periiana \rregna as proverbial for wealth. \r\r409 n. In the i6th and i7th centuries a popular belief obtained \rthat in the north-east of South America there existed a region of fabu- \rlous wealth, termed by the Spanish El Dorado, \'the Golden.\' A \rSpaniard named Martinez said that he had been cast adrift on the coast \rof Guiana, and had made his way to a city Manoa, the roofs and walls \rwhereof were made of precious metals. It was to discover this region \rthat Sir Walter Raleigh ascended the Orinoco in 1585. The belief may \rhave originated in the stories brought home by Spanish travellers of the \rriches of their conquests in South America. \r\r409. unspoiled, i.e. "not yet reached and plundered, like Mexico \rand Peru, by Europeans" (Keightley). \r\r410. Guiana, between the rivers Amazon and Orinoco ; the greater \rportion is now divided between Venezuela and Brazil. \r\rgreat city, i.e. Manoa. Geryon\'s sons, the Spanish ; Geryon being \rthe Spanish king whose oxen Hercules carried off (ALneid vin. 202, \r203). \r\r411. 412. Newton pointed out that Tasso had made the same arch- \rangel, Michael, perform the same service for Godfrey in Jerusalem \rDelivered, xvm. 93. Other parallels might be cited from Homer and \rVergil, e.g. JEn. n. 664 66, where Venus clears the mist away for \r/Eneas. \r\r413. promised clearer sight. Cf. Satan\'s words to Eve, IX. 705 709. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 629 \r\r414 19. Probably M. is thinking of his own blindness. According \rto his nephew Edward Phillips, he damaged his sight by constant use of \rspecifics. \r\r414. euphrasy, the plant \' eye-bright\' ; from efypaiveiv, \' to cheer.\' \rAccording to the old doctrine of the Signatures (see the Preface toS.A. \rand cf. Sir Thomas Browne, Vulgar Errors, II. 6), the efficacy of a \rplant or mineral was indicated by its similarity in colour or shape to the \rpart of the body diseased : euphrasy has a flower with an eye-like mark : \rhence its use as a remedy for dim sight, which it was thought to clear. \rCf. Hood\'s Midsummer Fairies, 114: \r\r"With fairy euphrasy they purged my eyes \rTo let me see their cities in the skies." \r\rpurged\', cf. a couplet in Pope\'s Messiah, 39, 40: \r\r"He from thick films shall purge the visual ray, \rAnd on the sightless eyeball pour the day." \r\rrue, a herb that was supposed to have many valuable qualities, e.g. \ras a specific against venomous bites. Keightley quotes from Gerard\'s \rHerball (1598) to the effect that rue "if boiled and kept in pickle, like \rsamphire, when eaten \'quickeneth the sight,\' and also that \'applied with \rhoney and the juice of fennell, it is a remedy against dim eyes.\'" The \rpopular name of rue, viz. "herb of grace" (cf. Hamlet, iv. 5. 181, 182), \rmay have been due to the esteem in which the plant was held on account \rof these medicinal properties; but perhaps it was so called as symbolising \rthe grace of repentance (i.e. from rue, \'to repent\'). \r\rMetaphors drawn from the eyesight come naturally to Milton \re.g. "if we will but purge -with sovereign eyesalve that intellectual \rray which God hath planted in us" (Of Reformation, I.) ; and "some \reye-brightening electuary of knowledge and foresight" (The Reason of \rChurch Government, n.). \r\r416. Psalm xxxvi. 9. \r\r418. mental sight-, cf. in. 5155, where M. contrasts the light \rof the eyes with that of the soul. The blind Samson was "with \rinward eyes illuminated," S. A. 1689.

Gen. iv. 4 only says, "And the Lord had respect unto \rAbel and to his offering " ; but the verse is usually explained as M. has \rinterpreted it. Cf. Gideon\'s offering, Judges vi. 21 ; Elijah\'s, i Kings \rxviii. 38; Solomon\'s, 2 Chron. vii. i : each was "consumed" with lire \rfrom heaven, in sign of acceptance. \r\r448, 449. " This is very properly made the first vision, and is so \rmuch enlarged upon, as it is of Adam\'s immediate descendants" \r(Newton). \r\r457. fact, deed; cf. ix. 928. \r\r458, 459. Alluding to Hebrews xi. 4. \r\r47793. This notion of the "cave" of Death, crowded with \rpersonified shapes of evil and disease, is purely conventional : many \rsuch pictures have been painted by poets. See n. 959 67. \r\rWe may remember that the fourth draft (see Introduction) of \rParadise Lost contained "a mask of all the evils of this world"; \rsome of the diseases here mentioned might have been among them. \rGray\'s sombre spirit inclined towards these gloomy abstractions, and \rthe Miltonic influence is strongly felt in the last stanzas of his Eton \rOde; cf. especially lines 61 70 and Si 90; also The Progress of \rPoesy, 4245. \r\r479. a lazar-house\', a hospital for lepers, lazar coming from the \rname of the beggar in Luke xvi. 20. The traveller Hentzner, who \rvisited England in Elizabeth\'s reign, noted that the English suffered \rmuch from leprosy, and that there were many \' lazar-houses.\' \r\r485 87. Three lines not in the First Ed. ; inserted in the \rSecond, "to swell the horrour of the description.... Pope says they \rare three admirable lines" (Newton). \r\r485. phrenzy, commonly spelt so in M. \r\r486 88. moon-struck madness, i.e. lunacy, so called from the \rsupposed effect of the moon (Lat. luna) in causing or increasing \rmadness. Cf. Othello, V. 2. 109. atrophy, Gk. drpoQia, a disease in \rwhich the body wastes away through not being nourished by the food \rtaken (Gk. d-, \'not,\' and rptQeiv, \'to nourish\'). pining= causing to \rpine, i.e. active in sense, as in Xii. 77. marasmus, the disease of con- \rsumption; Gk. papaa fj.6s, \'a wasting, withering.\' \r\r491. The " dreadful dart " of Death is mentioned in n. 672, 786. \r\r492. oft invoked\', cf. Sophocles, Philoctetes 797, 798 : \r\r\r\rNOTES. 631 \r\r\r\rw davare, da-vare, TTWS del \rOVT(S) Kar rj/j.ap ov duvet \rand Horace, Odes n. 18. 3840. \r\rshook; following its object dart. "I hate inversions, but this \rline is strong" (Tennyson). He remarked on the fine effect of the \rmonosyllable shook and the pause after it. \r\r494. deform= :Lat. deformis, \' hideous, unsightly\' ; cf. IT. 706. The \rCentitry Dictionary quotes Wyclif, Gen. xli. 19, " other seuen oxen... \rdefourme and leene." In S. A. 699 we find deformed^ \' deforming, \' \r\'that which makes unsightly.\' \r\r496, 497. The couplet, as editors note, is made up of reminiscences \rof Shakespeare. Cf. Macbeth, v. 8. 3032 : \r\r"Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane, \rAnd thou opposed, being of no woman born, \rYet I will try the last," \rand the same scene, 17, 18: \r\r"Accursed be that tongue that tells me so, \r\rFor it hath cow\'d my better part of man \\ " \rSo in Henry V. IV. 6. 28 32 : \r\r"The pretty and sweet manner of it forced \rThose waters from me which I would have stopp\'d ; \rBut I had not so much of man in me, \rAnd all my mother came into mine eyes \rAnd gave me tip to tears" \r\rCf. too the words of Laertes over Ophelia\'s dead body (Hamlet, IV. 7. \r18690). \r\r504 506. M. has in mind Seneca\'s Vitam nemo acciperet, si dare fur \rscientibus. Cf. Sir Thomas Browne, Christian Morals, in. xxv. : \r"When the Stoic said that life would not be accepted, if it were offered \runto such as knew it, he spoke too meanly of that state of being which \rplaceth us in the form of men." \r\rSo Drummond in A Cypress Grove: "O! who, if before he had a \rbeing he could have knowledge of the manifold miseries of it, would \renter this woeful hospital of the world, and accept of life upon such \rhard conditions?" (Works, II. 252). \r\r508, 509. Genesis i. 26, " And God said, Let us make man in our \rimage, after our likeness." erect ; see VII. 506 10, note. \r\r518, 519. his image, i.e. Appetite\'s. Eve\'s main inducement (he \rsays) to eat of the fruit was appetite ; this agrees with the account in \rix. 740, 741. \r\r531. Alluding to the maxim of the ancients, wdtv &yav ne qitid \rminis. The praises of a temperate life are often on Milton\'s lips. The \r\r\r\r632 PARADISE LOST. BOOK XI. \r\rtheme inspires a fine passage in Comus, 762 79. In // Penseroso, 46, \rhe invokes " Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet " ; and in the sixth \rElegy (59, 60), tells Diodati that the poet who would handle grave \rmatters and rival Homer must be ascetic in his life (tile quidem parce... \rvivat). No doubt, in the present passage, as in S. A. 55357, M. is \rthinking of his own habits. A "temperate man," says Aubrey; and \ragain: "very healthy and free from all diseases... till towards his latter \rend " (Life of M.). \r\r535 37- Perhaps a reminiscence, as Newton thought, of Cicero, \rDe Senectute 1 9, quasi poma ex arboribus, cruda si sunt, vix evellun- \rtur, si matura et cocta, decidunt, sic vitam adulescentibus vis aufert, \rsenibtis maturitas. \r\rj^2 46". M. is probably glancing at his own ill-health in later life. \rThere is a similar allusion in vi. 462 64, and S. A. 698700. " He \rdied of the gowt struck in" (Aubrey). Cf. Johnson\'s Life of M. \rAubrey says that he bore his suffering very cheerfully. \r\r544. Todd quotes a passage in which Burton in the Anatomy of \rMelancholy reckons the chief cause of melancholy to be "old age, \rwhich, being cold and dry, and of the same quality as Melancholy is, \rmust needs cause it, by diminution of spirits and substance." M. often \rrefers to the old physiology of the four " humours," of which melancholy \r(the black bile) was one ; see Comus, 809, 810, S. A. 600. \r\r55* 55^. The First Ed. had, somewhat abruptly, "Of rendering up. \rMichael to him repli\'d." There is an allusion here iojob xiv. 14. \r\r553> 554- " My father often quoted these lines, \' He that loveth his \rlife . . . \' " (Life of Tennyson). \r\rpermit to Heaven ; cf.

See Dryden\'s Song for \rSf Cecilids Day, 16 24, and Marvell\'s Music\'s Empire, the last stanza \rof which contains, I cannot help thinking, an allusion to Milton. \r\r560. The organ was Milton\'s favourite instrument; he had been \rtaught to play it by his father. See the accurate account of its \rmechanism in I. 707, 708. \r\r561. volant touch. Todd aptly compared Dryden\'s lines in \rAlexanders Feast\'. \r\r"Timotheus, plac\'d on high \rAmid the tuneful quire, \r\rWith flying fingers touch\'d the lyre ; \r\rThe trembling notes ascend the sky, \rAnd heavenly joys inspire." \r\r\r\rNOTES. 633 \r\rWe may add Thomson\'s lines in The Castle of Indolence, I. 40, on an \r\r^olian harp : \r\r"From which, with airy flying fingers light, \rBeyond each mortal touch the most refined, \rThe god of winds drew sounds of deep delight, \rWhence, with just cause, the harp of yEolus it hight." \r\rCf. too Dryden. sEneid, vi. 879, 880, and Collins, The Passions, 88, 89. \r\r562. instinct, instinctively. \r\r563. transverse, across, i.e. across the keys of the instrument. \rfugue.

III. 476. \rA fugue (Ital. fuga, \'a flight \') is a form of musical composition. The \rwhole passage has often been cited as a striking instance of Milton\'s \raccuracy in the use of technical terms of music. Indeed, the MSS. of \rhis early poems show that he was conscious of a tendency to carry this \ruse too far. Thus an earlier draft of the Ode At a Solemn Music had, \rin place of the existing lines 19, 20, the curiously technical couplet : \r"by leaving out those harsh chromatick Jarres \r\rof sin that all our musick marres." \r\rAgain, in Comus, 243, comparison of the MSS. shows that he first wrote \r"And hold a counterpoint to all heavns harmonies" afterwards \rchanged to "And give resounding grace etc." \r\r564. one w/io, i.e. Tubal-Cain, "an instructor of every artificer in \rbrass and iron," Gen. iv. 22. \r\r573. i.e. cast in moulds ("fusil"), or carved. \r\r573 9 2 - Referring to the descendants of Seth. According to \rJewish tradition they dwelt in the mountains near to Paradise (i.e. \' \' on \rthe hither side "), whereas Cain went out to " the east of Eden," Gen. \riv. 1 6. They are said by Josephus and other writers to have been \raddicted to the study of physics and astronomy ; cf. the Antiquities, I. \rii. 3, "They (i.e. the Sethites) were the inventors of that peculiar \rsort of wisdom which is concerned with the heavenly bodies, and \rtheir order." This tradition M. glances at in 578. \r\r581, 582. Genesis vi. i, 2. \r\r582 97. This passage may be compared with P. R. n. 153 71, \rand 362 65. "Milton seems to have taken [these particulars] from \rthe Oriental writers" (Newton). \r\r584. In I. 449 the Syrian women lament for Adonis " in amorous \rditties." \r\r586, 587. M. repeats himself in P. R. n. 161, 162 : \r" SkilPd to retire, and, in retiring, draw \rHearts after them tangled in amorous nets." \r\r\r\rG34 PARADISE LOST. BOOK XI. \r\rIn his first Elegy, 60, he had spoken of the Aurea qiuz fallax retia \rtendit Amor. Bowie notes that Ariosto has the phrase amoroso, rete \r(Orlando Furioso, I. 12); probably M. remembered it; he knew \rAriosto\'s work well. There may be a reminiscence of Milton in \rTennyson\'s Madeline : \r\r"all my heart entanglest \rIn a golden-netted smile." \r\rMilton\'s influence is almost as conspicuous in Tennyson\'s early \rpoems as in Keats. \r\r587. fast\\ misprinted first in a number of the early iSth century \reditions (Todd). \r\r588, 589. The star Hesperus is called stella Veneris. Cf. iv. 605, \rvin. 519, 520. \r\r591. Hymen, the classical god of marriage; cf. the invocation in \rV \'Allegro, 125, 126 : \r\r"There let Hymen oft appear \r\rIn saffron robe, with taper clear," \r\ri.e. the "nuptial torch" (590), which, strictly, had to be pine-wood. \rCf. the Masque of Hymen, " entered Hymen... in his right hand a torch \rof pine-tree," where, in the note, Ben Jonson cites Ovid Expectet \rpuros pinea tceda dies. See also Milton\'s Epitaph on the Marchioness of \rWinchester, 17 20. The colouring here (590 92) is classical; editors \rquote various parallels from the classics. \r\r595. symphonies, harmonious sounds. The word, which now \rsignifies a special form of musical composition, in M. means no more \rthan \'harmony\' (Gk. avuQuvia.}. Cf. Cotgrave, "Symphonic: Har- \rmony, tunable singing," and Bullokar (1616), "Symphonic, consent in \r\risick." \r\r607,608. the tents of wickedness. Psalm Ixxxiv. 10. \r\r6 1*. i.e. acknowledged none of his gifts ; for the position of none, \rcf. v. 538. So sometimes in Shakespeare. Cf. Twelfth Night, in. 4. \r262, " satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death. " \r\r614. Michael has just said that Cain\'s descendants would beget a \rbeauteou? race : here he appeals to the testimony of Adam\'s own eyes ; \rthe " female troop " are that race. \r\r620. troll ; properly to roll \' ; cf. the phrase \' to troll the bowl, \' i. e. \rto circulate it (in the game of bowls). Keightley quotes from Golding\'s \rtranslation of Ovid\'s Metamorphoses x. 664, "Neptune\'s imp... trolled \rdown at one side of the way an apple." But commonly troll was used \rin phrases like \'troll a catch\' (in music) ; cf. The Tempest, ill. 2. 126, \r" Let us be jocund : will you troll the catch?" and Jonson, Every Man \rin his Humour, I. 2, "I\'ll troll ballads." The notion there is \' to run \r\r\r\rNOTES. 635 \r\rover glibly, fluently.\' Probably, therefore, M. means that these "god- \rdesses " are voluble of speech. \r\r621 25. "The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they \rwere fair," Gen. vi. 2. " It is now generally agreed, that this passage \ris to be understood of the sons of Seth " (Newton). See V. 447, note. \r\r624. trains, snares, wiles. \r\r625 27. In Milton, as in Shakespeare, the quibbling use of words \roften expresses grim sarcasm : these lines contain two instances in point \r"swim" and "world." See also 756, 757. Todd noted that the \rfigurative sense of swim =\' revel \' was not uncommon; cf. ix. 1009, \rnote. \r\r627. Cf. IX. u, "That brought into this world a world of woe." \rPhrases like "a world of care" (Richard III. ill. 7. 223), "world of \rwealth" (Henry VI 1L III. 2. 211), meaning \' much of,\' are frequent in \rShakespeare. \r\r631. paths indirect\', cf. 2 Henry IV. IV. 5. 18486: \r\r"God knows, my son, \r\rBy what by-paths and indirect crook\'d ways \rI met this crown." \rindirect ; then a strong word \' wrong, unfair.* \r\r632, 633. An expression of Milton\'s own opinion. Unhappy in \rhis first marriage, which led to the composition of his bitter pamphlets \ron Divorce, and in the ill-behaviour of his daughters, he seldom let \rpass an opportunity for invective against women. See IX. 377, 823, \rnotes, and S. A. passim (especially 1010 60). \r\rThere is probably a quibble here, an old derivation of woman \rbeing woe to man ! \r\r635, 636. Again M. himself is the speaker. His conception of the \rrelative position of man and woman is summed up in a sentence that \roccurs more than once in his prose-works "woman was made for \rman." Cf. IV. 295 99, note. \r\r638 73 Obviously modelled on the description of the shield of \rAchilles, Iliad xvin. 478 et seq. Cf. the use that Vergil makes of the \rsame passage in ALneid vill. 608 731, describing the shield which \rVenus brings to ^Eneas, figured with representations of the greatest \rscenes in the history of Rome. \r\r642. bold emprise. Todd notes that the phrase occurs in Comus, \r610, and often in Spenser; an echo, perhaps, of the first line of Ariosto, \rOrlando furioso: " Le cortesie, 1\'audaci imprese, io canto." \r\r643. Repeated from II. 531, "Part curb their fiery steeds," where \rM. is describing (cf.

"This was probably intended by the poet as \ra reflection on the dangerous doctrine of his antagonist, Hobbes ; who \rwished to establish the false notion, that right is founded on might" \r(Todd). He compares Richard III. v. 3. 311, "Our strong arms be \rour conscience, swords our law." \r\r684. Milton\'s own "ill-mated" first marriage had strongly in- \rfluenced his life and opinions ; see X. 898 906, notes. \r\r687, 688. prodigious; cf. II. 624, 625. The reference is to Gen. \rvi. 4, " There were giants in the earth in those days." \r\r690. valour... virtue\', a glance at the fact that primarily virtue \rmeant \' valour,\' Lat. virtus. \r\r694, 695. Keeping the punctuation of the original, I think that the \rsense is \' and to be styled great conquerors shall be held the highest pitch \rof triumph for glorious deeds accomplished.\' This makes of triumph \rdepend on highest pitch understood from 693, and/0r glory done depend \ron of triumph : triumph signifying the honour which a man gets in \rreturn for glorious achievements. To "do glory " is a curious phrase in \rthis sense Shakespeare uses it differently in Sonnet 132 and Bentley \rproposed \' for glory won.\' \r\rNewton interprets the passage : \' To overcome shall be held the \r\rhighest pitch of glory, and shall be done for glory of triumph, to be \r(i.e. so as to be) styled great conquerors.\' But the ellipse shall be is \rawkward. \r\r698, 699.

Dunster observed that in several \rdetails of the account of Noah in these lines M. has followed the \rAntiquities of Josephus, bk. I. chap. iii. \r\r728 53. Genesis vi., vii. There are occasional echoes in the \r\rpassage of Ovid\'s description of the Deluge {Metamorphoses I.) ; e.g. \r\r"sea without shore " in 750 suggests Ovid\'s deerant qiioqite litoraponto, \r\rI. 292. Thomson followed Milton; cf. Spring (describing the Deluge) : \r\r"A shoreless ocean tumbled round the globe." \r\r738. the south-wind\', the precursor of rain. \r\r743. "deling may be thought too mean a word in poetry; but \rMilton had a view to its derivation from calum, cielo (Italian), \'heaven\'" \r(Richardson). The same consideration probably had determined its use \rby other poets. \r\r752. stabled, had their lairs; cf. Comus, 534, "stabled wolves," \ri.e. wolves in their haunts.

Comus, 362, "What need \ra man forestall his date of grief?"; or Landor, Gebir, VI. : \r"Oh! seek not destined evils to divine, \rFound out at last too soon." \r\r765, 766.

Exactly parallel is the sentence cited by Todd from The \rDoctrine and Discipline of Divorce, " the Jews, who were neither won \rwith the austerity of John the Baptist, and thought it too etc." \r\r779.

Milton\'s favourite idea (for which he might have quoted \rthe authority of Aristotle), that in the history of every nation moral \rcorruption and loss of political liberty go hand in hand : that a people \rwhich is corrupt ceases to care for freedom. Cf. S. A. 268 70: \r" But what more oft in nations grown corrupt, \rAnd by their vices brought to servitude, \rThan to love bondage more than liberty!" \r\rThe thought is often insisted upon in his prose-works.

A picture of Milton himself in the lonely last years of \rhis life ; perhaps he meant it as such. The " dark age " (from his point \rof view) represented that in which the Restoration had been brought \rabout; the "wicked ways" were those of the courtiers of Charles II.; \rthe " wrath to come " stood for the second Revolution which he foretold \rmore plainly in S. A. See v. 899, vii. 16, 27 (notes). \r\r821. devote ; cf. in. 208. An entry in the Cambridge MSS. shows \rthat M. contemplated writing a "tragedy" on "The flood." \r\r823. select, set aside. \r\r824. cataracts. In Gen. vii. u, the Heb. word rendered by \rwindows in the A. V. (or food-gates, margin) is translated /cara/5pd/crcu \rin the Septuagint, cataracts in the Vulgate. The word is appropriate \rof tropical rain and water-spouts (Newton). \r\r82935. It was a generally held opinion that Paradise was ob- \rliterated by the Flood ; but the particular explanation here given of its \rremoval appears to be of Milton\'s own invention. \r\r831. horned, branching into horns, i.e. channels, as a river does \rwhen it meets some obstacle. Probably we get the same notion in the \rLat. tauriformis as applied to rivers ; cf. Horace\'s tauriformis Aufidus, \rOdes iv. 14. 25, and Vergil, Georg. IV. 371, 372. Todd noted that the \rsame phrase horned flood, in the same sense, occurs in Ben Jonson, \rFox, in. 7, and Browne, Britannia\'s Pastorals, II. 5 (of which work \rMilton\'s own annotated copy survives. See n. 583, note). \r\r833. Probably the Euphrates is meant " the great river, the river \rEuphrates," Gen. xv. 18.

Gervase Markham\'s Sir Richard Grinuile, \r"Then casts he Anchor hulling on the maine" ; and Twelfth Nig/it, I. \r5. 217, "Will you hoist sail, sir?. ..No, I am to hull here a little \rlonger." Sir Thomas Browne may have remembered Milton when he \rwrote : "In this virtuous voyage of thy life hull not about like the ark, \rwithout the use of rudder, mast, or sail, and bound for no port" \r(Christian Morals, I. i.). \r\r842 49.

"And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the \rwaters asswaged," Gen. viii. i. M. would naturally select the north as \rthe parching, drying wind; see n. 489, 594, 595, notes; cf. Proverbs \rxxv. 23. He may, too, have recollected Ovid\'s account of the re- \rappearance of the earth, nimbis Aquilone remotis (Newton). \r\rThe north-east is typically the sky-clearing wind of poetry; cf. \rDante, Paradise, xxvni. 7984. \r\r846. their; referring to wave. M. may have dictated waves, or \rtreated wave as a collective noun (and so avoided writing its). \r\r84867. There are continual references to Genesis viii. \r\r85 1.

Thus Sidney calls sleep " The baiting-place \rof wit, the balm of woe"; and Donne, in his Progress of the Soul, \rdescribing the progress of a soul to Heaven, says : " She stays not in \r\r\r\rNOTES. 641 \r\rthe Air... she baits not at the Moon," i.e. does not stop there.

" he would labour my delivery," Richard III. \ri. 4 . 253. \r\r24. one, i.e. Nimrod. In what follows M. is giving expression to \rhis own republican feelings, and his dislike of a monarchy. Nimrod, \rhe says, was the first to claim sovereign power over his fellow-men : \rand then Nimrod is depicted in the most unfavourable light, so that we \rmay infer that the institution (i.e. monarchy) which had such an evil \roriginator must be itself evil. \r\rMilton\'s Common-place Book (see IX. 200), among some remarks \ron the origin of monarchy, has the entries : \r\r"The Lordly Monarchy first among men. In Assyria under the \rpower of Nimrod called a great Hunter, an Hebraisme for a Great \rTheife. Before his time was no sovereign." (Camden Society\'s 2nd \red., p. 42.) \r\r25. of proud, ambitious heart. In the Purgatorio, XII. 34 36, \rNimrod is classed with Satan as a type of pride. \r\r28. dispossess. These compounds with dis~ as a negative prefix, \rimplying \' to deprive of,\' are very common in M. ; cf. dispeople, dis- \rexercise, disenthrone (n. 229). \r\r30 35. The description of Nimrod in Gen. x. 9, " He was a mighty \rhunter before the LORD," has been explained in two ways : literally, ac- \rcording to the obvious sense of the English rendering ; figuratively, as \rmeaning that he was a great conqueror ; this is implied by the preceding \rverse, which speaks of his beginning to found an empire, while the \rHebrew translated "hunter" would appear, from other passages, to \rhave been applicable to a warrior making raids on his enemies. It is \runder the second aspect that M. regards Nimrod as a tyrannous ruler \rextending his empire and persecuting all who resisted : men, not beasts, \rwere his prey. See the entries quoted above and Eikonoklastes, n : \r"the bishops could have told him [Charles I.] that Nimrod, the first \rthat hunted after faction, is reputed by ancient tradition the first that \rfounded monarchy" (P. W. I. 405). Compare the picture of him that \rJosephus draws: "a bold man, and of great strength of hand. ...He \rchanged the government into a tyranny, seeing no other way of turning \r\rP.

I think that in the \rwhole of this passage concerning Nimrod and the Tower of Babel \rMilton had Josephus\' narrative in his mind. Dryden makes Nimrod \rthe first of great persecutors ; cf. The Hind and the Panther, I. \r282, 283: \r\r"Thus persecution rose, and farther space \r\rProduced the mighty hunter of his race." \rSimilarly Pope {Windsor Forest, 61, 62) : \r\r"Proud Nimrod first the bloody chase began, \r\rA mighty hunter, and his prey was man." \r\rOne of the chieftains of Diabolus in The Holy War (end) is "Captain \rNimrod," leader of "the Tyrannical " band. \r\r34. M. glances at the two interpretations which have been given \rof the phrase "before the Lord": (i) \'in defiance of God,\' which is \rcertainly in accordance with Josephus\' account ; (2) \'under God,\' i.e. \r"as usurping all authority to himself next under God, and claiming \r\\ijure divino" (Newton), just as in Milton\'s own day "the divine right \rof kings" had been put forward so strongly. The second view seems \rvery improbable. \r\r36. Alluding to the incorrect notion that Nimrod is connected \rwith the Heb. root m&rad, \'to rebel.\' More probably, the name is \rAssyrian. Of course, it suits Milton\'s sarcastic purpose to imply that \rthe first king in history was himself but a rebel. It is as though he \rwere flinging back the charge so often brought against his own political \rparty, that they were rebellious in their resistance to Charles I. \r\r38 62. Cf. the account of the building of the Tower of Babel in \rGen. xi. 2 9. M. follows the original very closely. The Bible does \rnot directly associate Nimrod with the building of the Tower of Babel ; \rit only states (Gen. x. 10) that Babel was one of his capitals. The view \rwhich M. has followed here (as in the last chapter of Eikonoklastcs} is \ra later belief, given by Josephus (Antiquities, I. iv. 2) ; Dante has it in \rthe Inferno, xxxi., Purgatorio, XI I., and Paradiso, XXVI. The tradition \rof Nimrod\'s connection with Babel or Babylon survives in the name of \rthe great temple-tower Birs-Nimrud, remains of which still exist. \r\r41, 42. Cf. Josephus (speaking of the Tower), "it was built of \rburnt brick, cemented together with mortar, made of bitumen, that it \rmight not be liable to admit water," Antiquities, I. iv. 3. \r\rthe plain, i.e. in Mesopotamia, bordered by the Euphrates. \r\rbituminous. The mineral pitch called bitumen (or asphalt} abounded \rin Babylonia, and was employed, it is thought, in the buildings of the \rcity of Babylon. See the note on " asphaltic slime," X* 298. \r\r42. the mouth of Hell. " This \' bituminous gurge \' the poet calls \r\r\r\rNOTES. 643 \r\r\'the mouth of hell,\' not strictly speaking, but by the same sort of figure \rby which the ancient poets called Taenarus or Avernus the jaws and \rgate of Hell. Vergil, Georg. IV. 467, Tienarias etiam fauces, a/la ostia \rDitis" Newton. Cf. , too, fauces graveolentis Averni (in the passage \rdescribing the descent of ^Eneas to Hades), ALn. vi. 201. \r\r52, 53. Cf. 2 Chronicles xviii. 11. See II. 190, 191, note. \r\r55. Sylvester (Du Bartas) describes the confusion of Tongues as \r"a jangling noise." Dante puts unintelligible words in Nimrod\'s mouth, \rin allusion to the Confusion of Tongues; see the Inferno, xxxi. 67 81. \r\r62. Cf. Gen. xi. 9, "Therefore is the name of it called Babel," \rwhere the margin has, "That is, Confusion." Cf. also Josephus, \rAntiquities, I. iv. 3, "The place wherein they built the tower is now \rcalled Babylon^ because of the confusion of that language which they \rreadily understood before ; for the Hebrews mean by the word Babel, \rConfusion." It appears, however, that "the native etymology (of \rBabylon] is Bab-il, \' the gate of the god //,\' or perhaps more simply \r\' the gate of God \' " (Smith\'s Bible Diet.}. \r\r73 74 "This being not asserted in Scripture, but only supposed \rby some writers, is better put into the mouth of Adam, than of the \rAngel" (Newton). \r\rCompare the reasons for the building of the Tower that Josephus \rgives : " He (Nimrod) said he would be avenged on God, if he should \rhave a mind to drown the world again ; for that he would build a tower \rtoo high for the waters to be able to reach ! and that he would avenge \rhimself on God for destroying their forefathers," Antiquities, I. iv. 2. \r\r76 78. The knowledge of physics which the lines reveal is not \rvery appropriate in the mouth of Adam (Keightley). \r\r77. pine-, a transitive verb; cf. xi. 486, and Richard II. v. i. 77. \r\r78. breath... bread. For Milton\'s use of these verbal quibbles and \rjingling sounds, see i. 642, xi. 62527, notes. \r\r81. affecting to subdue, aiming at subduing; commonly used, like \rLat. affectare, with a direct accusative of the thing aimed at.

VI. 42, note. \r\r85. twinned, i.e. closely united, as if they were twins; reason is the \rvery counterpart of liberty. Shakespeare several times uses the verb \rtwin in much the same way to express close connection, as in Carlo- \rlanus, IV. 4. 15, or close resemblance, as in Cymbeline, I. 6. 35, "the \rtwinned stones upon the beach" (i.e. exactly alike).

Cf. passages like Dent, xiv. 2, Ps. cxxxv. 4. \rM. discusses this point in The Christian Doctrine, I. 1 7. \r\r113. The allusion is to Abraham, faithful; see 152. \r\r114. on this side, i.e. eastward of; cf. Joshua xxiv. 2, 3. The \rword \'ibrt, whence Hebrew, which was first used of Abraham (Gen. \rxiv. 13), signifies \'living across,\' i.e. across, or east of, the Euphrates. \rIt was the term applied by the Canaanites to the Jewish immigrants \rinto Canaan. \r\r115. bred tip. M. infers this from Joshua xxiv. 2, where we are \rtold that "Terah, the father of Abraham... served other gods." Cf. \rThe Christian Doctrine, I. 17, "He called Abraham from his father\'s \rhouse. ..who was even an idolater at the time" (P. W. iv. 321). \r\r117. i.e. during the life-time of Noah. According to the chrono- \rlogy given in Gen. ix. and xi., Noah lived many years after the birth of \rTerah ; and we have just seen, from Josh. xxiv. 2, that Terah wor- \rshipped false gods. \r\r1 1 8. Cf. S. A. 1 140, " My trust is in the Living God " ; the phrase \ris frequent in the Bible; cf. Heb. iii. 12, i Tim. iv. 10. \r\r1 20, 121. Genesis xii. ; Acts vii. In visions (see XI. 377) the highest \rtype of revelation was thought to be made; we often find the word \rcontrasted with dream. Cf. Cornus, 453 58; so in Cowley\'s Essays \r(p. 21, Pitt Press ed.), " I fell at last into this vision ; or if you please \rto call it but a dream, I shall not take it ill, because the father of \rpoets tells us, even dreams, too, are from God" (where the Homeric \rreference is the same as in 61 1). See Numbers xii. 6. \r\r127. 128. " By faith Abraham went out, not knowing whither \r\rhe went," Heb. xi. 8. \r\r128. I see him, but thou canst not. A variation on the method of \rnarration adopted in book xi. (423). The wording is like Oberon\'s \r" That very time I saw, but thou [Puck] couldst not," A Midsummer- \rNights Dream, n. i. 155. \r\r129. Haran was the place where Abraham received the command \rfrom God to journey to Canaan (Gen. xii. i 4). But M. is thinking \rof Acts vii. 2 4, where it is said that "The God of glory appeared \r\r\r\rNOTES. 645 \r\runto our father Abraham" before he came "out of the land of the \rChaldeans." \r\r130. Ur\\ the capital of southern Chaldea, and a great com- \rmercial mart ; it then lay close to the mouth of the Euphrates, as at \rthat time the waters of the Persian Gulf extended much further inland \rthan now. But from the reference to Haran we may conjecture that M. \rsupposed Ur to be in Upper Mesopotamia, i.e. at least 400 miles north \rof its real site. In this he followed a view formerly held by many \rscholars, and suggested by Acts vii. 2 4, the Scriptural passage, as we \rhave said, on which, mainly, this couplet is based. An old theory iden- \rtified Ur with Orfah=the Greek Edessa, in northern Mesopotamia. \r\r130, 131. M. speaks as though Abraham\'s journey were con- \rtinuous, and his stay at Haran a mere episode, whereas the Scripture \rimplies that he dwelt there some time (Gen. xi. 31, Acts vii. 4). \r\rpassing... the ford\', this must refer to the crossing of the Euphrates ; \rbut Haran, or Charran (the Carra of the famous Parthian victory), was \ron the western bank of the Euphrates. We must remember that in the \ri ;th century scholars had to depend on very imperfect maps, travellers\' \rnarratives and such-like doubtful evidence. \r\r132. servitude, servants : abstract for concrete. \r\r135 51. In these lines M. first traces the journey of Abraham to \rthe Promised Land (cf. Gen. xii. 5, 6) ; then sketches in outline the \rgeographical position and extent of the Land, glancing at the number of \rScriptural texts which suit his purpose ; and finally shows what was the \rscope of the promise made to Abraham. \r\r139 41. The four boundaries are : (i) the town (or district) of \rHamath, in Upper Syria, lying in the valley of the Orontes ; afterwards \rcalled Epiphaneia by Antiochus Epiphanes, and now again known as \rHamah ; expressly mentioned as the northern limit of Canaan in Numb. \rxxxiv. 7, 8. (2) The Desert of Zin, forming part of the southern frontier \rof the Holy Land (Numb, xxxiv. 3). (3) Mt Hermon, \' the lofty peak \' ; \rthe most conspicuous mountain in Palestine, and the great landmark \rof the Israelites. In Scripture Hermon is associated with, not the \reastern but, the northern boundary; cf. Ps. Ixxxix. 12, "The north \rand the south thou hast created them : Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice \rin thy name." Perhaps this was why M. afterwards added that the \rJordan was the "true limit eastward." (4) The "western sea," i.e. \rthe Mediterranean ; cf. Numb, xxxiv. 6, " And as for the western \rborder, ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be your \rwest border." \r\r143, 144. Mt Carmel is one of the most striking geographical \rfeatures of Palestine, being the only headland which breaks the coast-line. \r\r\r\r646 PARADISE LOST. BOOK XII. \r\rdouble-founted\\ probably an allusion to the old belief that the \rJordan, in its upper course, was formed by the union of two streams \rthought to give the river its name; these were the Dan and i\\\\z Jor, \rand their supposed place of confluence lay near Caesarea Philippi. In \rreality, Jordan is from a Heb. root \'to flow down, descend,\' and the \rsources of the river must be looked for in the water-shed of Libanus on \rthe one hand, and of Mt Hermon on the other. Sylvester, however, \rhad mentioned its "double source," and, as Todd pointed out, the \rtraveller George Sandys speaks of it as " seeming to arise from Jor \rand Dan, two not far distant fountaines" \r\rProbably Sandys was Milton\'s main authority for the topography of \rPalestine. His Travels^ first published in 1615, were very popular, often \rreprinted, and often quoted. They contain a vivid and detailed account \rof the Holy Land. Milton mentions Sandys in Of Reformation in \rEngland^ P. W. II. 380, and borrowed from him (almost certainly) the \raccount of the rites of Moloch in the Nativity Ode, 204 10, and \rP. L. I. 392 96 ; and there is reason for thinking that in Samson \rAgonistes the description of the amphitheatre in which the catastrophe \rof the play occurs was inspired by a passage of the same writer. It is \rquite likely therefore that Sandys was responsible for doublc-founi to/ here. \r\r145, 146. true limit. The Jordan is mentioned as the eastern \rboundary of Canaan in Numb, xxxiv. 12. Nine tribes and a half of \rthe Israelites dwelt west of it, only two tribes and a half (Manasseh) on \rthe eastern bank. The river is constantly spoken of as a boundary ; \rcf. such phrases as \' over Jordan,\' \' beyond Jordan.\' \r\rhis sons\', the allusion is to i Chronicles v. 23. Senir is the \rAmorite name for Mt Hermon ; cf. Deut. iii. 9. But in the verse of \rChronicles just referred to, Senir and Hermon are distinguished, so that \rSenir may also have been applied to some range of hills running off \rfrom the great mountain in an eastern direction ; and this, apparently, \rwas Milton\'s idea; cf "long ridge," which would be a very inappro- \rpriate description of Hermon. We know that Manasseh spread eastward \rfar beyond their original territory even over the deserts between \rPalestine and the Euphrates. \r\r151 63. Cf. Gen. xvii. 5; also Gal. iii. 9, "So then they which \rbe of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham." The historical allusion \rin the lines is, of course, to Jacob\'s going down to Egypt at the bidding \rof Joseph Gen. xlv., xlvi. \r\r158. Cf. Vergil\'s septemgemini trepida ostia Nili (/En. vi. 801). \rThe allusion to its seven mouths is frequent. \r\r167. of guests he makes them slaves ; on this classical idiom see the \rnotes on iv. 153, vin. 433. \r\r\r\rNOTES. 647 \r\r172, "And they spoiled the Egyptians," Exod. xii. 36. \r173 190.

Job vii. 12 ("whale") and Ps. xci. 13, where the R.V. \rsubstitutes "serpent" for "dragon." \r\r197. Cf. vn. 293, and Milton\'s paraphrase on Ps. cxiv., "Why \rturned Jordan toward his crystal fountains ? " ; also that on Ps. cxxxvi., \r" The floods stood still, like walls of glass." \r\r200. Saint.

Alluding to the "seventy of the elders of Israel," \rwhom Moses was directed to associate with himself in the govern- \rment of the Israelites (Exod. xxiv., Numb. xi. 16 24), in which \rCouncil some scholars have seen the beginnings of the Jewish \rSanhedrim.

The senti- \rment of the whole line is that expressed by Tacitus corruptissima \rreipublica pluHmte leges (Peck). Cf. Milton\'s Second Defence of the \rPeople of England: " since there are often in a republic men who have \rthe same itch for making a multiplicity of laws, as some poetasters have \rfor making many verses, and since laws are usually worse in proportion \ras they are more numerous..." (P. W. i. 293). \r\r287 306. This is one of those theological passages into which \rMilton distils the doctrines of a number of texts (as interpreted by \rhimself) ; such as Rom. iii. 20, iv. 22 25, v. i, 17, 21, vii. 7, 8, viii. 15, \rx. 5 ; Heb. vii. 19, ix. 13, 14, x. i, 4, 5 ; and Galatians iii., iv. \r\rpravity, tendency to evil, moral perversity. M. does not use the \rword elsewhere. Johnson has it in his Life of Milton: "Ariosto\'s \rpravity is generally known." \r\r287. evince, demonstrate. Cf. Burton, Anatomy, " Arion made \rfishes follow him, which, as common experience evinceth, are much \raffected with music." Milton has the word once elsewhere ; cf. P. R. \rIV - 235, " Error by his own arms is best evinced." For the noun in the \rsame sense, cf. the first lines of Sir Thomas Browne\'s Vulgar Errors^ \rspeaking of "the common infirmity of human nature; of whose de- \r\r\r\r650 PARADISE LOST. BOOK XII. \r\rceptible condition... there should not need any other eviction than the \rfrequent errors we shall ourselves commit, even in the express declare- \rment thereof." \r\r297 99. The sense is \' the law cannot appease the conscience, \rnor can man perform "the moral part" of the law.\' \r\r307309. Deuteronomy xxxiv. The passage is well illustrated by \rThe Christian Doctrine, I. 26: "The imperfection of the law was \rmanifested in the person of Moses himself; for Moses, who was a type \rof the law, could not bring the children of Israel into the land of \rCanaan, that is, into eternal rest ; but an entrance was given to them \runder Joshua, or Jesus." \r\r310, 311. Joshua, \' the Saviour,\' is the same word as Jesus\', in the \rSeptuagint Joshua is called \'lT7<roDs. Other forms ztzjehoshua, Hoshea \rand Oshea ; and Hosanna (a cry for help) is from the same stem meaning \r\' to save.\' Joshua is treated as a type of Christ (cf. Hebrews iv. 8), the \rpoints of resemblance being many ; and perhaps that which M. specially \rrefers to in the words " His name and ojfice bearing " is, that as \rJoshua led the Jews through the wilderness and brought them to the \rLand of Promise, so Christ brings men, after their journey through the \rworld, into the presence of God, as being their Mediator (xi. 32 44) \rand Advocate.

The seventy years of Captivity, foretold by Jeremiah \r(xxv. 12), dated from B.C. 606 to B.C. 536. \r\r348 50. The "kings " are Cyrus, who first proclaimed the decree \rfor the rebuilding of the Temple, and his successors Artaxerxes and \rDarius. The time occupied in the work was from B.C. 536 to B.C. 515. \rThis period of Jewish history is dealt with in the book of Ezra. \r\r353 56. An allusion to the struggle for the high-priesthood, in the \r2nd cent. B.C., between Jason and Menelaus (i.e. Joshua and Onins each \rhad adopted a Greek name at a time when Greek influence was affecting \r\r\r\rNOTES. 651 \r\rthe Jews very strongly). Jason obtained the office from the Syrian king \rAntiochus Epiphanes, circa 175 B.C.; afterwards it was transferred to \rMenelaus, 172 B.C. The conflicts that arose between the rival high- \rpriests gave Antiochus an excuse for assaulting Jerusalem and plundering \rthe Temple, 170 B.C. Two years later, 168 B.C., his troops again \roccupied the city ; the Temple was desecrated ; " an idol altar " was \rset up, and the Jews were forbidden the observance of their own \rreligion. These events are related in i , 2 Maccabees, and by Josephus. \r\rIndirectly, lines 353 55 are an attack, like 507 37, on the \rclergy. \r\r35^, 357- ifayviQit Asmonean family, in whose line the office of \rhigh-priest descended, B.C. 153 B.C. 35. The first of the race to \rassume the title of king was Aristobulus I., B.C. 107. Their sovereignty \rended with the capture of Jerusalem by Pompey, 63 B.C. \r\rDavid\'s sons. The last ruler of Israel who could claim direct descent \rfrom David was Zerubbabel, under whose leadership the Jews returned \rfrom the Babylonish Captivity in 536 B.C. The names of his descend- \rants we are told in the genealogies of Christ (given from somewhat \rdifferent points of view) by Matthew and Luke. That of Matthew \r" exhibits the successive heirs of the kingdom (of David) ending with \rChrist," i.e. it shows us to whom Milton refers when he speaks of \r"David\'s sons," the rightful heirs, though not "regarded." \r\r358. a stranger, i.e. Antipater an Idumean (the Greek form of \rEdomite), who was made governor of Jerusalem by Pompey in 61 B.C., \rand afterwards procurator of Judaea by Julius Caesar, 47 B.C.

This passage should be compared with the Nativity Ode, \rand the similar account of Christ\'s birth in P. R. i. 242 54. The \rverbal resemblances are numerous. Matthew ii. ; Luke ii. \r\r364. solemn; "sent in solemnity.... This single word solemn \rexpresses the importance of the message" (Richardson). \r\r366, 367. thither, i.e. to Bethlehem ; and M. speaks as though the \rsong of the angels was heard there not merely " in the field." \r\rsquadroned, in troops; cf. the Nativity Ode, 21. \r\r36971. The literary form of the passage is primarily from Vergil, \rALneid i. 287, Impcrium oceano,famam qui terminct astris. The theo- \rlogical idea is that of the "glorious reign of Christ on earth with his \rSaints, so often promised in Scripture, even until all his enemies shall \rbe subdued" (The Christian Doctrine, I. 33). In this theological work \rMilton states his belief at length, quoting the passages of Scripture on \r\r\r\r652 PARADISE LOST. BOOK XII. \r\rwhich it rests, such as Tsai. ix. 7, Dan. vii. 13, 14, 22, Luke i. 32, 33, \rMat. xix. 28, Rev. ii. 25 27. \r\rThe editor of The Christian Doctrine in Bohn\'s edition of Milton\'s \rprose-works says : \r\r"The Millenarians or Fifth Monarchy men of the i7th century \rwere sufficiently numerous to occupy a place in the history of Milton\'s \rtimes. It appears from this treatise that he himself was far from \rholding the extravagant and fanatical opinions which characterised the \rgreater part of this sect." He held, in common with certain of the \rFathers and later theologians, the belief expressed in the sentence \rquoted above. It is glanced at in vii. 157 61, and inspires, as the \reditor of the Doctrine points out, one of the finest passages of his \rprose, viz. the close of the treatise Of Reformation in England. \r\r373.

"It is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree," \rGal. iii. 13, the reference being to Deut. xxi. 23 ; that passage, however, \rseems to imply crucifixion after death, i.e. as a mark of disgrace. It \rwas not only among the Jews that crucifixion was held in the utmost \rhorror; many passages show that the Romans regarded it as the greatest \rof degradations a servile supplicium from which citizens and even \rfreedmen were exempt.

There \ris the same allusion in iv. 193 (see note) ; and in the Sonnet on Cromwell \rhe speaks of the "hireling wolves, whose Gospel is their maw." \r\rThis passage (507 37), though it nominally traces (from Milton\'s \rpoint of view) the history of the Church from Apostolic times, is perhaps \rprimarily directed against the Church of England ; similar charges are \rscattered passim through Milton\'s prose-works. A close parallel is \rthe long piece (113 31) of invective, thinly disguised under pastoral \rallegory, in Lycidas. Time had intensified Milton\'s opinions. \r\rWe have seen in many places Milton\'s anti-ecclesiastical bias; \ra fresh and characteristic illustration has been noted recently by \rProfessor Firth. He shows that in his History of Britain Milton \rdeliberately "avoided the ecclesiastical side of British and Saxon \rhistory," and refused to supplement the meagre political records at his \rdisposal by "drawing upon the fund of information which his authorities \rsupplied about the religious life of the times. The development of a \rscientific interest in the monuments and institutions of the past was one \rof the characteristics of I7th century England, but so far as it showed \ritself in researches into ecclesiastical antiquities Milton took no interest \rin the movement." \r\r511. M. often taunts the clergy with avarice and desire of prefer- \rment. Cf. An Apology for Smectymnuus, " they, for lucre, use to creep \rinto the Church undiscernibly," P. W. ill. 164. \r\r511 14. In his prose- works M. frequently depreciates the \rwritings of the Fathers : the "traditions" of the Church as to doctrine \rand forms, are in his eyes " a broken reed " (Areopagttica). \r\rsuperstitions ; see III. 451 54, note. \r\r516, 517. to join secular power.

The allusion (Genesis iii. 24) occurs in The Doctrine and \rDiscipline of Divorce, 13, where he is arguing against those who con- \rdemn divorce because it did not belong to the earliest times of Jewish \rhistory: "But still they fly back to the primitive institution, and would \rhave us re-enter paradise against the sword that guards it " (P. W. \rill. 243). Cf. too Marvell\'s lines (with their happy reminiscences of \rRichard II.

Most editors explain brand to mean \'sword,\' a sense it often \rbore in O. E., from the flashing of a sword -blade. Cf. Spenser, The Faerie \rQucene, v. i. 8, "When so he list in wrath lift up his steely brand." \rThe old use of brand =\' sword\' is revived in Tennyson ; cf. the Morte \ra" Arthur, where the word is used several times of King Arthur\'s sword \rExcalibur, e.g. "So flash\'d and fell the brand Excalibur." Curiously, \rbrand =\' fire-brand\' does not occur anywhere in Milton\'s poetry, except \rin the MS. of Comus, 384, where " the noontyde brand " is a synonym \rfor " the mid-day sun," afterwards substituted. \r\r646. Editors compare Richard II. i. 3. 206, 207 (Mowbray\'s \rparting words) : \r\r"Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray; \rSave back to England, all the world\'s my way." \r\r648, 649. One of the subjects entered in the Cambridge MSS., under \rthe heading "tragedies," is "Adam in Banishment." \r\rThis couplet has been much discussed since Addison proposed to \romit it on the inadequate grounds that the lines strike a note of sadness, \rwhereas an epic is supposed to require a cheerful ending, and that they \rare less impressive than the preceding couplet. Peck proposed to trans- \rpose 646, 647 and 648, 649, making the poem conclude with "and \rProvidence their guide." Bentley, by way of crown to his emendatory \rtoils, composed a distich, "as close as may be to the author\'s words, \rand entirely agreeable to his scheme." But the lines stand in the First \rand Second Eds., and are therefore as authentic as any other part of the \rpoem ; and, apart from their entirely Miltonic style, their calm beauty \ris appropriate to the feeling of mingled resignation and reluctance with \rwhich we may suppose that the exiles left their Paradise. Pearce justly \rnotes that this feeling, indeed, corresponds precisely with the injunction \r(xi. 117) laid on Michael. Shakespearian tragedy usually ends on a \rquiet note. \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. \r\r\r\rTHE COSMOLOGY OF PARADISE LOST. \r\rPARTS of Paradise Lost are not easily understood without some \rknowledge of Milton\'s conception of the Universe. I shall attempt \rtherefore to set forth some of the main aspects of his cosmology : to \rexplain, in fact, what he means by constantly recurrent terms such as \r\' Empyrean,\' Chaos,\' * Spheres,\' and the like. \r\rIt is in book v. that he carries us back farthest in respect of time. \rThe events described by Raphael (from line 563, onwards) precede not \ronly the Creation of the World, but also the expulsion of the rebels \rfrom Heaven. And at this era, when the seeds of discord are being \rsown, we hear of two divisions of Space Heaven and Chaos : Heaven \rlying above Chaos. \r\rIn book vi. the contest foreshadowed in book V. has begun. Now \ra third region is mentioned Hell (vi. 53 55) : a gloomy region carved \rout of the nethermost depths of Chaos. Its remoteness from Heaven \rmay be inferred from I. 73, 74. Milton\'s working hypothesis, then \rhis general conception of space and its partitionment prior to the \rCreation may be expressed roughly thus: above 1 , Heaven; beneath, \rHell ; between, a great gulf, Chaos. \r\rLet us see what he has to say concerning each. \r\rHeaven, or the Empyrean 2 , is the abode of the Deity and His \rangelic subjects. It is a vast region, but not infinite. In x. 380 \rMilton speaks of its "empyreal bounds"; in n. 1049 of its "battle- \rments 3 "; in vi. 860 of its "crystal wall." These fence Heaven in \r\r1 i.e. from the point of view of this World, the position of which we shall see. \r\r2 The terms are synonymous. Empyrea.u=-\\j&\\., empyrceus, from Gk. e/x.7rvpo?. \rThe notion was that the Empyrean was formed of the element of fire (irup). Compare \rBatman vppon Bartlwlome (1582), a work which is a sort of encyclopaedia of the \rbeliefs and \'\'science" (so to speak) current in the Elizabethan time : \r\r\'* Ccelujn Enipereum is the first and highest heaven, the place of Angells, the \rConn trey and habitation of blessed men. And hath that name Empireum from Pir, \rthat is fire. ..not for burning, but for light and shining.. .and is the highest dwellyng- \rplace of God" (p. 122). \r\r8 Cf. Lucretius\' jtammantia moenia mundi(l. 74) and Gray\'s "flaming bounds of \rSpace" (Progress of Poesy). \r\r42 2 \r\r\r\r660 PARADISE LOST. \r\rfrom Chaos. When Satan voyages through space, in quest of the \rnew-created World, he kens far off the crystal line of light that \rradiates from the empyreal bulwarks, marking where runs the severance \rbetwixt Heaven and Chaos (n. 1034 37). In the wall of Heaven are \rthe "everlasting gates" (vn. 565) opening on to Chaos (v. 253 56, \rvn. 205 209). The shape of Heaven Milton does not determine \r(ll. 1048); perhaps it is a square (x. 381). Its internal con- \rfiguration and appearance he describes in language which reminds \rus of some lines (574 76) in book v. May not the Earth, says Raphael, \r"Be but the shadow of Heaven, and things therein \r\rEach to other like, more than on Earth is thought"? \rMilton expands this idea, and developing to the utmost the symbolical, \robjective presentment of the New Jerusalem in the Revelation, depicts \ra Heaven scarce distinguishable from an ideal Earth 1 . In fact, his \rHeaven and his Garden of Eden have much in common ; so that Satan \rexclaims, "O Earth, how like to Heaven!" (ix. 99). Thus the \rHeavenly landscape (if I may describe it in Miltonic language) has \rits vales, wood-covered heights and plains (vi. 70, 639 46) ; it is \rwatered by living streams (v. 652) ; and fair with trees and flowers 2 \rimmortal amaranth and celestial roses (ill. 353 64), and vines \r(v. 635). Daylight and twilight and " dim Night " are known there \r(v. 627 29, 645, 685, vi. i 15). And soft winds fan the angels as \rthey sleep (v. 654, 655). \r\rThese angelic beings, divided according to tradition into nine \rOrders, each with particular duties, perform their ministries and \rsolemn rites (vn. 149) in the courts of God (v. 650) and at the high \rtemple of Heaven (vn. 148). Their worship is offered under forms \rwhich recall, now the ritual of the Temple-services of Israel, now the \rinspired visions of St John. They celebrate the Deity who dwells \rinvisible, throned inaccessible (ill. 377) on the holy mount (vi. 5), \rhowbeit omnipresent, as omnipotent, throughout Heaven and all \rspace : round whose throne there rests a radiance of excessive bright- \rness, at which even Seraphim, highest of Hierarchies, veil their eyes \r(ill. 37582). \r\rIt has been objected that Milton\'s picture is too material. But he \rhimself takes special pains to remind us that the external imagery \runder which he represents his concepts is symbolical, not literal \radopted merely as a means of conveying some impression of that \rwhich is intrinsically indescribable. The truth, I believe, is that he \rhas applied to Heaven the descriptions of \' Paradise f in the apocalyptic \r\r1 The Earth deteriorates after the fall of man (x. 651 et seq.). \r\rThis is a descriptive detail most conspicuous in early Christian apocalyptic works. \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 66l \r\rliterature of tie first centuries of Christianity. The Revelation of \rPeter (dating perhaps from early in the second century A.D.) affords \ran illustration of these descriptions. St Peter is represented as \rasking our Lord where are the souls of the righteous dead "of \rwhat sort is the world wherein they are and possess glory? And \rthe Lord showed him [me] a very great space outside this world shining \rexcessively with light, and the air that was there illuminated with the \rrays of the sun, and the earth itself blooming with unfading flowers, and \rfull of spices and fair-flowering plants, incorruptible and bearing a \rblessed fruit : and so strong was the perfume that it was borne even to \rus 1 from thence. And the dwellers in that place were clad in the \rraiment of angels of light, and their raiment was like their land : and \rangels encircled them 2 ." \r\rThe second region, for which Chaos seems the simplest title, is \ralso variously called "the wasteful Deep" (n. 961, vi. 862), " the utter \rDeep" (vi. 716), "the Abyss," "the vast (or "main") Abyss" (i. 21, \rIII. 83, vii. 211, 234). Here rules the God of Chaos with his consort \rNight (n. 95963). According to the long description in book II. \r890 et seq. t this region is an illimitable ocean, composed of the embryon \ratoms (semina rerum) whereof all substances may be formed whereof \rHell and the World are afterwards formed. It is a vast agglomeration \rof matter in its primal state, " neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire 3 ." \rHere prevails eternal anarchy of storm and wind and wave and stunning \rsounds. In vn. 210, an, the Messiah and His host stand at the open \rgate of Heaven and look forth on to Chaos ; and what they behold is an \rAbyss " Outrageous as a sea,, dark, wasteful, wild." \r\rThe creation of Hell, we may perhaps assume, just precedes the \rfall of the angels 4 . It has been prepared for their punishment when, \r\r1 i.e. St Peter and the other disciples who are with our Lord on the Mount of \rOlives. See The Gospel according to Peter, and the Revelation of Peter (Cambridge \rUniversity Press ed., 1892), pp. 48, 49. \r\r2 Dr James (whose version I have just quoted) gives a similar passage from a \rrather later work, the History of Barlaam andjosaphat, wherein the Paradise of the \rjust is revealed in a vision as "a plain of vast extent, flourishing with fair and very \rsweet-smelling flowers, where he saw plants of all manner of kinds, loaded with \rstrange and wondrous fruits, most pleasant to the eye and desirable to touch. And \rthe leaves of the trees made clear music to a soft breeze and sent forth a delicate \rfragrance, whereof none could tire. ..And through this wondrous and vast plain [he \rpassed] to a city which gleamed with an unspeakable brightness and had its walls of \rtranslucent gold, and its battlements of stones the like of which none has ever seen. \rAnd a light from above... filled all the streets thereof: and certain winged hosts, each \rto itself a light, abode there singing in melodies never heard by mortal ears." \r\ra Cf. the description of Chaos in Spenser\'s Hymne in Honour of Love, 57 84. \r\r4 Cf. the English Faust-book (1592) where Faustus asks when Hell was made and \rMephistophiles replies " Faustus, thou shalt know, that before the fall of my lord \rLucifer was no hell, but even then was hell ordained" (Thorns\' English Prose \rRomances^ III. 185). \r\r\r\r662 PARADISE LOST. \r\rafter the proclamation in v. 600 15, they have \'revealed their \rrebellious spirit. To form Hell a part of the abyss has been taken. \rIn II. 1 002, 1003, Chaos complains that his realm has leen encroached \rupon by Hell "stretching far and wide beneath." Re und Hell runs \ra wall of fire (l. 61, 62) ; overhead spreads a fiery vault CT cope (i. 298, \r34 5 34^)\' At the descent of the angels Hell lies open to receive them \r(VI. 50 55) ; then the roof closes (vi. 874, 875), and they are prisoners. \rHenceforth the only outlet from Hell into Chaos is through certain \rgates, the charge whereof is assigned to Sin (n. 643 et seq. ). At her \rside, as protector, stands Death, ready with his dart to meet all comers \r(n. 853 55). To please Satan (her sire), Sin opens the gates. \rAfterwards she cannot shut them; and all who will may pass to \rand fro between Hell and Chaos. Later on (when the bridge from \rHell has been made) this change becomes terribly significant. As to \rthe inside of Hell, we hear of a pool of fire (l. 52, 221); dry land \rthat burns like fire (l. 227 29) ; and drear regions of excessive \rcold and heat, intersected by rivers (ll. 574 et seq.). Here again the \rpicture is largely traditional, owing, no doubt, much to Dante, \\\\ho \rin turn owed much to the apocalyptic descriptions before mentioned. \rImmediately after the expulsion of Satan the World is created \r(VII. 131 et seq.). By "the World" is meant the whole Universe of \rEarth, seas, stellar bodies and the framework wherein they are set. \rThe Son of God goes forth into the abyss (vn. 218 et seq.), and with \rgolden compass marks out the limits of this World ; so that Chaos is \ragain despoiled of part of his realm (as he laments, u. 1001 1006). \rThe new World is a globe or hollow sphere, suspended in the abyss, \rand at its topmost point fastened by a golden chain (see II. 1051, note) \rto Heaven. In u. 1004 1006 Chaos tells Satan of this Universe: \r\r" another world, \r\rHung o\'er my realm, linked in a golden chain \rTo that side Heaven from whence your legions fell." \rThe length of this chain, i.e. the distance of the World from the \rEmpyrean, is not stated, I believe; but the distance was not compara- \rtively very great (u. 1051 53, vil. 618). \r\rAlso, between the globe (again, on its upper side, i.e. that nearest \rto the Empyrean) and the gate of Heaven there stretches a golden stair ; \rused by good angels for descent and ascent when they are despatched to \rEarth on any duty such as that which Raphael discharges in books \rV. VIII. This stair (suggested by Jacob\'s dream?) is not always let \rclown (in. 501 18). And hard by the point where the golden stair \rtouches the surface of the globe there is in later times, after the fall \rof man another stair (or rather bridge), which leads, not upward to the \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 663 \r\rEmpyrean, but downward to Hell: i.e. it extends over the portion \rof Chaos that intervenes between Hell and the World (n. 1024 \r33, X. 282 et seq.}. This bridge 1 , the work of Sin and Death, is \rused by evil angels when they would come from Hell (its gates being \ropen) to Earth "to tempt or punish mortals" (n. 1032). \r\rHence a good angel and an evil, visiting mankind simultaneously, \rthe one descending the golden stair, the other ascending the bridge, \rwill meet at this point of the surface of the globe. And to enter the \rglobe, i.e. to get through its outer surface to the inside, each must pass \rthrough the same aperture in the surface, and descend by the same \rpassage into the interior : as Milton explains in book in. There he \rdescribes how Satan journeys through Chaos, till he reaches and walks 2 \ron the outer surface of the World (in. 418 30). But how to pass to \rthe interior? The surface is impenetrable, and there seems to be no \rinlet. Then suddenly the reflection of the golden stair which chances \rto be let down directs his steps to the point where the stair and the \rbridge come into contact with the globe, and here he finds what he \rseeks an aperture in the surface by which he can look down into the \rinterior. Further, there is at this aperture a broad passage plunging \rright down into the World being, really, a continuation of the \rgolden stair. Thus Satan, standing on the bottom step of the stair, \rand looking straight up, sees overhead the gate of Heaven ; and \rlooking straight down, sees the interior of the globe, leagues beneath \r(III. 526 et seq.}. \r\rSimilarly on the seventh day of the Creation the angels, gazing from \rHeaven\'s gate down the stair and down the broad passage which \rcontinues the stair, see, as Satan did, into the new-made World \r(vil. 617 19): \r\r"not far, founded in view \rOn the clear hyaline, the glassy sea 3 ." \r\rIn short, at the point in the surface of the globe nearest to the \rEmpyrean, there is a choice of ways: the stair leading to Heaven; \rthe bridge to Hell; and the broad passage to the interior of the \rWorld: \r\r\r\r1 In the English Faust-look t 1592 (Thorns\' English Prose Romances, HI. 194), \rMephistophiles says: " We have also with us in hell a ladder, reaching of exceeding \rhighth, as though the top of the same would touch the heaven, to which the damned \rascend to seek the blessing of God, but through their infidelity, when they are at \rvery highest degree, they fall down again into their former miseries." With the last \rpart of this extract cf. P. L. HI. 484 et seq. It seems to me highly probable that \rMilton studied the Faust-book (which was immensely popular), as well as Marlowe\'s \rdramatic adaptation of it; see n. 596 603, V. 671, notes. \r\r2 i.e. like a fly moving up a lamp-globe (Masson). \ri . 8 i.e. the Crystalline Sphere. \r\r\r\r664 PARADISE LOST. \r\r"in little space \r\rThe confines met of empyrean Heaven \rAnd of this World, and on the left hand Hell \rWith long reach interposed ; three several ways, \rIn sight, to each of these three places led 1 ." \r\rAnd descending the broad passage what would an angel find in the \rinterior of the globe? What is this globe as Milton, following the \rastronomy of his 2 time, has described it? \r\rThe globe as then conceived may best be likened (in Plato\'s \rcomparison 3 ) to one of those puzzles or boxes in which are contained \ra number of boxes of gradually lessening size : remove the first, and \ryou shall find another inside, rather smaller: remove the second, and \ryou shall come on a third, still smaller: and so on, till you reach \rthe centre the kernel, as it were, round which the different boxes \rwere but successive shells. Now, of the globe of the World the \rEarth (they said) is the kernel (is it not often called \'the centre 4 \'?); \rand a stationary body itself it is encased by numerous shells or \rSpheres : the number of the Spheres being a subject of dispute and \rvarying in the different astronomical systems. Milton, accepting 5 for \rthe purposes of his epic the Ptolemaic system as expanded by the \rastronomer Alphonsus X. of Castille, recognises ten Spheres. A \rSphere, it should be noted, is merely a circular region of space \rnot necessarily of solid matter. Indeed, of the ten Spheres only one, \rthe Primum Mobile, appears in Milton\'s description to consist of some \rmaterial substance. Seven of them are the Spheres of the planets, \ri.e. the orbits in which the planets severally move. \r\r\r\r1 x. 320 24. \r\r8 I do not mean to imply that the Ptolemaic system was still generally believed in \rat the time when /\'. L. was published, but that it satisfied Elizabethan writers, of \rwhom Milton was the last. \r\r" On the slowness with which the Coperaican theory was diffused, and especially \rBacon\'s opposition to it, see Whewell\'s History of the Inductive Sciences, i. 404 \r12, ed. 1847. Copernicus died in 1543, and his opinions were introduced into \rEngland mainly through Giordano Bruno, who came over about 1583" (note in \rClarendon Press ed. of The Advancement of Learning, p. 294). \r\rs See the Myth of Er in the Republic 617, 618; and the note on Arcades, 64, where \rthe passage is translated. \r\r* Cf. perhaps i. 686; and certainly The Winter\'s Tale, n. i. 102, Troilns \rand Cressida, i. 3. 85. \r\r6 He was evidently familiar with the Copernican system (cf. iv. 592 97, vni. 130 \r40, notes); and the question has been asked why he did not follow it in the poem. \rThe Copernican theory was new, without a scrap of literary association and with no \rpoetic terminology: whereas the Ptolemaic view and its delightful fictions as to the \rSpheres, their harmonies, and the like, had become a tradition of literature, expressed \rin terms that recalled Marlowe and Shakespeare and Jonson and the sacri vates of \rEnglish verse. To surrender this poetic heritage merely out of deference to science \rhad been impossible pedantry a perverse concession to the cold philosophy that \r" empties the haunted air and unweaves the rainbow " (Lamia). \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 665 \r\rThe order of the Spheres, which fit one within the other 1 , is, if we \rstart from the Earth as the stationary centre 2 of the Universe, as \rfollows: first, the Spheres of the planets successively the Moon, \rMercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn ; then, outside the \rlast of these (i.e. Saturn), the Firmament or Cselum Stellatum, in which \rare set the \' fixed stars \' ; then, outside the Firmament, the Crystalline \rSphere ; and last, the Primum Mobile enclosing all the others. Com- \rpare the famous lines (481 83) in book ill. describing the passage \rof the souls of the departed from Earth to Heaven : \r\r"They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed, \rAnd that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs \rThe trepidation talked, and that first moved." \r\rIt remains to note three or four points in these lines. Milton treats \rthe Sun and Moon as planets (v. 17177, x. 651 58). Compare \rTroilus and Cressida, I. 3. 89, "the glorious planet Sol," and Antony \rand Cleopatra, v. 2. 240, 241 : \r\r"now the fleeting moon \rNo planet is of mine." \r\rThe \'fixed stars\' are referred to four times in the poem but only once \r(v. 176) with the word \'star\' added: in the other places (111.481, x. \r661) they are called simply "the fixed " or " fixed " (v. 621). Though \rthey are unmoved their Sphere revolves round the Earth, moving from \rEast to W r est, completing a revolution in twenty-four hours, and carrying \rwith it the seven inner Spheres 3 . The rapid motion of this Sphere is \rglanced at in V. 176 ("their orb 4 that flies"). The Crystalline Sphere \rand the Primum Mobile were not included in the original Ptolemaic \rsystem. They were added later, to explain certain phenomena which \rthe earlier astronomers had not observed, and for which their theories \roffered no explanation. Thus the supposed swaying or "trepidation" \rof the Crystalline Sphere was held to be the cause of the precession of \rthe equinoxes. This Sphere is described as a vast expanse of waters \r(see the note on VII. 261 74). It encircles the eight inner Spheres. \rThe original notion may perhaps be traced to the waters "above the \rfirmament" in Genesis i. 7. Compare the picture in VII. 270, 271 of the \rWorld \r\r"Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide \rCrystalline ocean." \r\r1 Cf. Marlowe\'s Faustus, vi. 38, 39 : \r\r"As are the elements, such are the spheres, \rMutually folded in each other\'s orb." \r\r2 Cf. vni. 32, " the sedentary Earth " ; it is " self-balanced " (vii. 242)= " upon her \rcentre poised " (v. 579). \r\r3 These have separate motions of their own. \r\r* \'Orb\' and \'Sphere\' are interchangeable terms when it suits Milton. \r\r\r\r666 PARADISE LOST. \r\rThe main purpose that this "ocean" serves is to protect the Earth from \rthe evil "influences" of Chaos; those "fierce extremes" of temperature \rwhich might penetrate through the outside shell (the Primum Mobile] \rand " distemper" the whole fabric of the Universe, did not this wall of \rwaters interpose (vn. 269 73). The whole idea is well illustrated by \rthe following passage from a curious old work entitled The Treasurie \rof Auncient and Moderne Times (1613): \r\r"Aboue the Firmament, is the Heauen Christaline, or watry, \rwhich learned men are of the minde, that it was created by God aboue \rthe other Heauens : to the ende that it might mitigate the great heat \rwhich the other Heauens acquired by their motions, and by the Stars \rbeing in them." \r\rKeightley says that this Sphere was also known as the " Glacial." \rLast comes the Primum Mobile 1 , the " first 2 convex" of the World, \ri.e. the outside case of our box or puzzle. It is made, as we saw, of \rhard matter ; but for its crust of substance Chaos would break in on \rthe World, and Darkness make inroads (in. 419 21). The first \rmoved itself, it communicates motion to the nine inner Spheres. In \rElizabethan literature allusions to it are not infrequent : we will con- \rclude by giving three. Compare Spenser, Hymnt of Heavenly Beaut \'ie: \r\r"these heavens still by degrees arize, \rUntil they come to their first Movers bound, \rThat in his mightie compasse doth comprize, \rAnd carry all the rest with him around"; \rand Marlowe, Faustus*: \r\r"He views the clouds, and planets, and the stars, \rThe tropic zones, and quarters of the sky, \rFrom the bright circle of the horned moon \rEven to the height of Primum Mobile" \\ \r\rand Bacon, Of Seditions and Troubles : "for the motions of the greatest \rpersons in a government ought to be as the motions of the planets under \rPrimum Mobile" \r\r\r\r1 Dante\'s prinio giro {Pnrgatorio, I. 15); see also the Paradiso, \\. 123 and xm. \r24, where he makes the Primum Mobile represent the swiftest motion, and xxx. 107. \rHe uses the expression "the First Mover" (lo Motor prinio) in a different sense, viz. \ras a synonym of "The Almighty" {Purgatorio, xxv. 70). \r\ra in. 419. To Satan coming from Chaos it is the nm ; in our calculation, as we \rstarted from the Earth, it Is the last. \r\r3 Scene vi. chorus, 5 18, in the third Quarto, 1616; the passage is not in the two \rearlier editions of 1604 and 1609 (Ward). \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 667 \r\r\r\rB. \r\rON THE CHARACTER OF MILTON\'S SATAN. \r\rI have reserved for this Appendix notice of some points in Milton\'s \rdelineation of the character of Satan. First, as to the rank which \rMilton assigns to him before his revolt, and the cause of that revolt. \rMilton speaks of Satan as an archangel 1 "if not the first Archangel" \r(v. 660) : that is, he is inclined to give Satan pre-eminence over all \rangelic beings. But this pre-eminence is not emphasised so much as we \rmight have expected. \r\rThe immediate cause of the rebellion in Heaven is the proclamation \rthat all should worship the Messiah as their Head (v. 600 15). Satan \rresents the command, conceiving himself " impaired" (v. 665) thereby; \rand he makes its pretended injustice a means of drawing away a \rthird part of the angels from their allegiance. They are equal, he \rsays, to the Messiah : self-begotten, not created : not liable to pay \rworship; and so, playing on their pride, he wins them (v. 772 \r802, 853 69). Meantime, in his own heart an even stronger motive \ris at work ; to wit, jimbition to be himself equal to the Deity \rnay, superior. He not only disclaims submission to the Son : he \rstrives "against the throne and monarchy" (i. 42) of the Almighty \rHimself; and it is as the foe rather of the Father than of the Son that \rthe great archangel is set before us in Paradise Lost. \r\rTouching both matters there was much tradition, whereof it may be \rinteresting to cite two or three illustrations from popular works 2 with \rwhich Milton is likely to have been familiar. To take, for example, \rthe English Faiist-book\\ Faustus asks: "But how came lord and \rmaster Lucifer 3 to have so great a fall from Heaven? Mephistophiles \ranswered, My lord Lucifer was a fair angel, created of God as im- \rmortal, and being placed in the Seraphims 4 , which are above the \rCherubims, he would have presumed upon the Throne of God... upon \rthis presumption the Lord cast him down headlong, and where (i.e. \rwhereas) before he was an angel of light, now dwells in darkness 5 ." \r\r1 Contrast the first extract from the Faust-book, later on. \r\r2 I choose three works each of which may, I think, be regarded as a rtsuwe of \rmany of the current traditions of demonology. Two of the books the Faust-book, \r1592, and Scot\'s Discourse on Devils, 1584 were extremely popular, and personally \rI believe that Milton had studied both. Scot devotes several chapters to "Lucifer \rand his fall." The third work Heywood\'s Hierarchie, 1635 is very serviceable \rto an editor of Paradise Lost. \r\r3 A common name of Satan. \r\r* The highest of the Hierarchies. We may note the forms \' Seraphims/ \r\' Cherubims.\' \r\r5 Thorns\' English Prose Romances, in. 184. \r\r\r\r668 PARADISE LOST. \r\rLater on Faustus returns to the subject, enquiring "in what estimation \rhis lord Lucifer was, when he was in favour with God " : also touching \rhis form and shape: to which Mephistophiles replies, "My lord \rLucifer... was at the first an angel of God, yea he was so of God \rordained for shape, pomp, authority, worthiness, and dwelling, that he \rfar exceeded all the other creatures of God, and so illuminated that he \rfar surpassed the brightness of the sun, and all the stars... but when he \rbegan to be high minded, proud and so presumptuous, that he would \rusurp the seat of God\'s Majesty, then was he banished 1 ." \r\rThe Faust-book, it will be seen, agrees with Milton on both points; \rwhile, as regards one of them Satan\'s rank it is more explicit than \rParadise Lost. Equally explicit is Heywood\'s Hierarchic of the Blessed \rAngels (1635). There (p. 336) we read that of the angels Lucifer \rwas first-created and chief: \r\r"As he might challenge a prioritie \rIn his Creation, so aboue the rest \rA supereminence, as first and best." \r\rHeywood mentions Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel, and adds \r(p. 337) that great as they were, \r\r" Yet aboue these was Lucifer instated, \r\rIlonor\'d, exalted, and much celebrated." \r\rReginald Scot goes even further, remarking 2 that according to the \rteaching of some divines Satan even after his fall exceeded in power \rany of the angelic host. It seems to me therefore something strange \rthat Milton did not unequivocally invest Satan with superiority over \rall the angels. \r\rAs to Satan\'s motive Heywood 8 differs from Milton, making jealousy \rof mankind the cause ; while Scot writes 4 : "Our schoolemen differ much \rin the cause of Lucifer\'s fall [some alleging one thing, some another, \rwhile] others sale, that his condemnation grew hereupon, for that he \rchallenged the place of the Messias." This accords more with Paradise \rLost, v. 66 1 65. \r\rFor Milton Satan is the type of pride. The type was already fixed. \rAs an epithet of Lucifer \'proud\' had passed into a proverb. Thus \rGower said 5 : \r\r" For Lucifer with him that felle \rBar pride with him into helle. \rThere was pride of to grete cost \rWhan he for pride hath heven lost"; \rand Marlowe 6 : \r\rThorns, in. 187. \rNicholson\'s ed., ji. 425. \rP; 339- * P- 423. \r\rConfessto Amant.\'s, book I. \rFauxtus, m. 67 69. \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 669 \r\r"Faust. How comes it, then, that he is prince of devils? \rMeph. O, by aspiring pride and insolence ; \r\rFor which God threw him from the face of heaven"; \rand Greene 1 : \r\r"proud Lucifer fell from the heavens, \r\r\r\rLucifer and his proud-hearted friends \rWere thrown into the centre of the earth." \r\rDante had made him il primo superbo that is, the archetype of all \rpride (Paradiso, xix. 46; see also xxix. 55 57). \r\rMilton therefore did not wholly conceive or create the character of \rthe arch-rebel. Tradition, literary no less than theological, prescribed \rthe dominant idea in that nature : enough if Milton developed the idea \rin harmony with the design of his poem. This he did. He depicts \rSatan as an embodiment of the spirit of pride and ambition 2 : not the \rambition which is an honourable desire of praise that last infirmity of \rnoble minds but the fevered lust for power which springs from over- \rmastering self-esteem. In Satan this spirit of egotism is the poison \rthat permeates his whole being, vanquishing and vitiating all that \ris good in him. \r\rFor at the outset of the action of Paradise Lost Satan has much that \ris noble and attractive in his nature. To have made him wholly evil \rhad repelled, and lessened the interest of the poem, which turns, in no \rslight degree, on the struggle between the good and evil elements in \rhim. Indeed, this very pride is not without its good aspect. Herein \rlies the motive power that nerves him at every crisis to face insuperable \rdifficulties ; to cherish immortal hope though hope of revenge ; and \rto adventure "high attempts." \r\rOn the other hand, it is this same spirit that drives him onward to \rhis final fall. If at any moment he is minded to repent and submit \rthrough pity for the friends whom he has ruined, or mankind whom \rhe schemes to ruin, or himself through sense of his ingratitude (iv. \r42 45) towards the Almighty whatever the motive relentless, resist- \rless egotism sweeps aside compunction, and denies him retreat. To \rsue for grace were to humble himself in the eyes of his followers and \rin his own : which must not be (iv. 79 86). \r\rSteadily does Milton keep this idea before us. There is no possi- \rbility of missing or mistaking his intention. The very word \' pride \' \rrecurs 3 like some persistent refrain, ringing clearest at the great crises, \rthe fateful moments when the action of the epic enters on a fresh stage. \rThere are moments of relenting : as when in the fourth book (27 et sey.) \r\r1 Friar Bacon, ix. 59, 65, 66. \r\r2 Cf. Satan\'s own words in iv. 40. \r\r* Cf. i. 36, 58, 527, 572, 603 with many other examples. \r\r\r\r670 PARADISE LOST. \r\rSatan looks down upon Eden from his resting-place on Mount Niphates, \rand a brief while is inclined to give up his attempt and seek re- \radmission into Heaven; or as when in the ninth book (455 72) he sees \rEve in the Garden and is touched by her beauty and innocence, and \rdisarmed of his ill thoughts. Always, however, the end is the same : \r" the hot hell " of pride in his heart breaks anew into flame ; and he \rgoes forward to his work 1 . Had not pride led him to undertake it? \r\rSatan\'s resolve to compass the fall of man is prompted by several \rfeelings each a phase of self-esteem. There is jealousy. Man has \rusurped his place dispossessed him and his followers. At sight of \rAdam and Eve he exclaims (iv. 358 60) : \r\r"O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold? \rInto our room of bliss thus high advanced \rCreatures of other mould, Earth-born perhaps ! " \r\rThe same feeling finds expression in almost the same words later on \r(ix. 148, 149). That others should receive favour from the Almighty \rand, as he thinks, at his expense wounds his pride. \r\rAgain, there is desire to assert his supremacy by undertaking an \roffice from which the mightiest of his followers recoil in fear. Nowhere \rdoes Satan stand forth so eminent and sublime \' \' with monarchal pride " \ras in the scene in the second book where he proffers himself for the \rgreat enterprise. The counsel of Beelzebub has been applauded by all \r(386 89): but who will carry it out? None dare: and then Satan, \rproclaiming his readiness, once more confirms his sovereignty. Here \rtoo pride has ruled. \r\rBut the strongest motive remains : desire \r\r"To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss \r\rOf that first battle, and his flight to Hell 3 ." \r\r"To spite the great Creator" (n. 384, 385) he will bring ruin on the \rearth and its inhabitants : which, if not victory, were revenge. The \rnotion flatters his self-conceit. It is born of the old pride. And \rMilton dwells on it with fitting insistence 3 . \r\rIs Satan the \'hero\' of Paradise Lost! We might think so did we \rnot read beyond the first four books. But to trace his history in the poem \rto its inglorious close is to dispel the impression. Milton can scarcely \rintend that we should regard as \'hero\' as worthy of sustained admira- \rtion one who passes from the splendour of archangelic being to the \rstate of a loathsome reptile 4 . The hideous metamorphosis in x. 504 \r3 2 is the necessary contrast to those scenes at the beginning of the epic \rin which the great rebel does appear in heroic grandeur : and we must \rlook on both pictures. If Paradise Lost narrates the fall of man, it \r\r1 Cf. Mr Stopford Brooke\'s admirable Study of Milton, p. 148. \r\ra iv. it, 12. Cf. vi. 905, 906. * Cf. Satan\'s words in ix. 16371. \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 671 \r\rnarrates too and no less clearly the fall of man\'s tempter. The \rself-degradation of Satan is complete : outward and inward : of the \rform and of the spirit: a change ever for the worse of shape and \rmind and emotion. \r\rThere is the outward sign. Before his expulsion he is pre-eminently \ra lustrous being, clothed with ethereal radiance and glory so much \rdoes his name "Lucifer" argue 1 . And afterwards he retains some- \rthing of this "original brightness," though much has passed from \rhim (i. 97, 591 94). But gradually what was left decreases in pro- \rportion as the evil in him prevails : so that Uriel perceives the foul \rpassions that dim his face (iv. 124 30), while Gabriel marks his \r"faded splendour wan" (iv. 870), and the Cherub Zephon taunts him \rtherewith (iv. 835 40). Equal is his loss of physical force. On the \rfields of Heaven he does not fear to meet Michael in combat (vi. 246 \ret seq.): in the Garden of Eden he doubts himself a match for Adam: \r"Foe not informidable ! exempt from wound, \rI not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain 2 \rEnfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven." \r\rIn fact, he is glad that he has to deal with the woman not the man \r(ix. 47988). \r\rNor this because of lost strength alone. He shuns the "higher \rintellectual" of Adam (ix. 483), who would be better able than Eve to \rsee through his arguments and so resist temptation. He is conscious \rof his own decline in intellect. The strong intelligence which inspires \rhis speeches in the first two books has degenerated, by perverse use, \rinto mere sophistical slyness, a base cunning even as wine may lose \rits savour and turn to vinegar. He is no more the mighty-minded \rarchangel: he is naught but the serpent "subtlest beast of all the \rfield." Lastly, every impulse in him towards good has died out. The \relement of nobility that redeemed his character at the outset from \rabsolute baseness has been killed. In evil he moves and has his being, \rso that himself confesses "all good to me becomes bane"; and in \rdestroying lies his sole delight (ix. 114 30). \r\rHardly therefore shall we believe that Milton meant us to see in the \rfallen and ever-falling archangel the hero of Paradise Lost. One feels, \rrather, that there is a break at the end of the fourth book and that \rthenceforth the continuity of Satan\'s characterisation is truer to theology \rthan poetry. The hero, if there be one, is Adam, in whom suffering \rworks a purification that promises nobler things to come ; or Messiah. \r\r1 Cf. vn. 131, note, and the second extract from the Faust-book, and Marlowe, \rFaust us, v. 155 : \r\r"beautiful \r\rAs was bright Lucifer before his fall." \r8 See i. 55, vi. 327, notes. \r\r\r\r672 PARADISE LOST. \r\r\r\rPARADISE LOST, i. 36175; n. 274, 275, 397402. \r\rThese 1 passages (with several in Paradise Regained] are illustrated \rby the following in Hooker\'s Ecclesiastical Polity \', I. iv. 3: "The fall \rof the angels was pride. Since their fall, their practices have been the \rclean contrary unto those before mentioned. For being dispersed, some \rin the air, some on the earth, some in the water, some 3 among the \rminerals, dens, and caves, that are under the earth ; they have by all \rmeans laboured to effect a universal rebellion against the laws, and as \rfar as in them lieth utter destruction of the works of God. These \rwicked spirits the heathens honoured instead of gods, both generally \runder the name of dii infcri, \'gods infernal\'; and particularly, some in \roracles 3 , some in idols 4 , some as household gods, some as nymphs: in \ra word, no foul and wicked spirit which was not one way or other \rhonoured of men as God, till such time as light appeared in the world \rand dissolved the works of the Devil." The interest of this passage is \rthat Hooker identifies the fallen angels (i) with the heathen more \respecially classical deities, (2) with the daemons supposed to inhabit \rthe four 5 \'elements.\' This twofold identification accords with the \rapparently universal belief of mediaeval writers. The precise steps \rwhereby it was reached cannot perhaps be determined ; but the process \rmay have been on this wise. \r\rThe belief in the existence of daemons is as old as Hesiod\'s time ; \rcf. the Works and Days 121 26. It is found passim in Greek \rphilosophy. The character attributed to these daemons varies in the \rdifferent authorities. In a rough generalisation we may say that they \rwere regarded as semi-divine powers intermediate between gods and \rmen. Their dwelling-place also varies: yEschylus (Perstf 628) de- \rscribes them as xdtviot ; Plato 8 (Cratylus 398 A) as viroxOovioi. The \rtheory which assigns the air as their special abode, and which is \rbrought forward very prominently in Paradise Regained^ dates from Neo- \r\r\r\r1 I have to thank Mr R. D. Hicks for many of the references used in this sketch ; \rin fact, all the classical material in sections C and D is derived from him. \r8 Cf. Plato\'s fiai\'/u.ofes vwoxOovioi. \r\r3 Cf. the second passage quoted later on from Zeller. \r\r4 Alluding perhaps to Ps. xcvi. <; see later. \r\rHooker omits the daemons of fire (= Philo\'s TO. nvpiyova. ?). \r\' He is quoting Hesiod, /. c. (where, however, our texts have <inx66vwt). \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 673 \r\rPythagorean writers 1 . Now the tendency of Greek popular superstition \rand of later philosophy was to merge these daemons in the gods : a \rtendency traceable as far back as Democritus 2 . He (says Zeller 3 ) \r"may be regarded as the first who, mediating between philosophers \rand the popular religion, entered upon the course so often pursued in \rafter times, viz. that of degrading the gods of polytheism into daemons." \rThis course is carried further by the Neo-Pythagoreans for whom, \r"as for the other philosophers of that time, daemons take the place of \rthe popular gods in all cases where what is attributed to the gods was \rfound irreconcileable with a purer conception of the divinity, and yet \rwas not altogether to be denied. Divination 4 proceeded from them, \rexpiations were made to them: Timaeus Locrus even affirms that the \rgods committed to them the government of the world" {Zeller 5 ). And \rthis identification of gods and daemons is completed in Philo Judseus 6 \rand Rabbinical writers. Not to multiply proofs, we may take a single \rillustration which will readily occur to most readers, viz. i Cor. x. 20, \rwhere St Paul (influenced, I presume, by Rabbinical teaching and \rGreek philosophy) expressly, and appropriately since he is writing to \rGreeks, calls the divinities of the Gentiles 3ai/x6na7. The notion may \rbe traced in many patristic works. \r\rThe next step is the identification of the daemons with the fallen \rangels. This is made by Philo, who treats the daemons as inter- \rmediaries or messengers (ayyeXoi) between God and the world, and \rsays that they are the beings whom Moses calls angels oOs aXXoc \r<(>i\\6(To<j)oi Sai/ioj/as, a77^\\oi;s Mwi/a^s efadev 6vo/j.dfeiv, \\f/vxal 5\' tlaiv \rKO.T& rbv dtpa irer6fjLevai 8 . This identification is also a Rabbinical \rdoctrine. It suffices for our purpose again to recall St Paul\'s words in \rEphes. ii. 2, where Satan, chief of the fallen angels, is termed "the \rprince of the power of the air," i.e. lord of the daemons of the air. \r\rThe daemons, then, having been identified on the one hand with the \rheathen gods, and on the other with the fallen angels, the identification \rof the fallen angels with the heathen gods naturally followed. Hence \r\r1 i.e. from the first century B.C. onwards. "They imagine the daemons to be \rsouls dwelling in the space between the earth and the moon, and occupying, alike in \rvirtue of their nature and their abode, a place intermediate between gods and men" \rZeller {Philosophie dtr Griechen, in. 2, p. 138); he cites various Neo-Pythagoreans, \rsummarising their views thus. \r\r2 Circa 420 B.C. \r\rPre-Socratics, English trans., H. p. 289. \r\rCf. Hooker, ante; Nat. Ode, 175 (note); P. R. i. 430, 431, where the Saviour \rsays to Satan (prince of the daemons), "all oracles by thee are given." \rPhilosophie der Griechen, HI. 2, p. 139. \rB.C. 30 A.D. 40 (circa). \r\rThe same word is used in the Septuagint in Psalm xcvi. 5, where the A.V. has \ridols." Cf. Hooker, ante, and P. L. I. 375. \r8 De Gigant. 285 A (263, 7). \r\rP. L. 43 \r\r\r\r674 PARADISE LOST. \r\rit is common to find all three treated as the same in patristic and \rmediaeval works. This is Hooker\'s view; it is also Milton\'s. The \ridentity of the fallen angels and the heathen gods is stated so explicitly \rin P. L. i. 361 75 that it were superfluous to dwell on the point. \rThe identity of the fallen angels and the daemons 1 is less emphasised \rin P. L. (but see n. 274, 275, 397 402, notes). In P. R. it is con- \rspicuous. As a signal illustration P. R. II. 121 26 may be instanced. \r\r\r\rD. \r\rPARADISE LOST, I. 51517. \r\rWhat are we to understand by the expressions "the middle air" \r(P. L. i. 516) and "the middle region of air" (P. R. n. 117), the \rmeaning of which would appear to be the same? Most editors are \rsilent on the subject; some interpret "middle\'^\' between heaven and \rearth.\' This view, though possible, does not appear to me wholly \rsatisfactory, and I venture to offer another that Milton alludes in both \rplaces to a theory, evidently current at that time, of the division of the \rair into three regions, and that "middle region" is really a quasi- \rscientific term (media regio} which would be perfectly intelligible to \rall scholars of the i7th century. As to the history of this threefold \rdivision : the first hints of it that fell in my way were the passage in the \rAdamus Exul of Grotius and one in Jonson\'s Masque of Hymen (ad fin. ). \rThe combined evidence of these led to the conclusion that the three- \rfold partition must have been a conception then recognised : not indeed \ra classical conception, but experience had often shown that in such \rmatters Milton\'s views are post-classical, what one may vaguely call \r\' mediaeval.\' The kindness of Mr R. D. Hicks enables me to throw \rsome light on a doctrine which, in my opinion, fits the two Miltonic \rpassages with extreme appositeness. Of the references with which \rMr Hicks has supplied me space will admit but two or three. \r\rFirst, then, the following extracts from the works of Bartholomaeus \rKeckermann 2 , the German savant \', are important as coming from what \rmay be considered a compendium of contemporary science. Kecker- \rmann is speaking of the divisions of the air ; and he remarks that there \rare two main theories as to its partition the older and less correct which \r\r1 i.e. the daemons of all four \'elements/ not of air alone. \r\rD.

MDCXIV. \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 675 \r\rpostulates two regions, the modern and more accurate which recognises \rthree. He says: Aristoteles atque adeb veteres Physici locum aeris \rdividunt in Trp6Tepov & detirepov, id est> primum & \'secundiim, sive \rsuperior em &> inferiorem...Recentiores a^ltem accuratius paulb totiim ill ltd \rspacium (sic) aereum partiti sunt in tres paries sive regiones...Perfectior \rsive accuratior distinctio aeris est in tres regiones> nempe in Supremam, \rMediam o Infimam. The genesis of this doctrine he traces thus : \rDistinctio ista...ab interpretibus Aristotelis prinmm tradita fuit, nempe \rab Averroe 1 , a Tktmistio* 6 Simplicio* t 6 deinde latius explicata ab \rAlberto* M. &* aliis Scholasticis, idque potissimum eo fine, ttt doctrina \rmeteorum clarior atque illustrior fieret (as for sundry other reasons 5 ). \rHe discusses at some length the characteristics of each region; and \rthough we are most concerned with what he has to say of the middle \rregion (media] his remarks being founded on what Albertus had \rwritten we may just note that he represents the upper region (supremo) \ras the driest and hottest, and the lowest region (infima) as hot, through \rradiation from the surface of the earth heated by the sun\'s rays, but also \rmoist. Now as to the media regio he writes (i) that it is peculiarly \rcold (a) because vapours collect there from land and sea, (b) because \rof its reaction (aWiTrep/o-raffts) against the heat of the upper and lower \rregions ; (2) that, beginning where the sun\'s rays lose their power its \rlowest point earthwards it reaches to the tops of the loftiest mountains \rits highest point heavenwards. The diameter of this belt of air is \rcomputed by some at seven English miles. \r\rKeckermann has referred above to his authorities ; let us glance at \rAlbertus Magnus. In his Commentary on the Meteora Albertus has a \rchapter 6 headed, Qiiare non sunt nubes in superiori regione aeris, sed in \rmedia tantum. Here, after discussing the upper and lower regions, he \radds, est autem in medio duarum regionum, scilicet superioris cestuosce, \r&* inferioris calidce &* humidce, tertia aeris zona sive regio... quce est \rvalde frigida et excellentis frigiditatis. And then he goes on to explain \rhow vapour gathers there infra ahissimos monies and condenses and \rforms clouds, so that this middle region is the gathering place for rain 7 . \rLater 8 he writes to the same effect trio, sunt aeris inter stitia> infimum \r\rA.D. 1120 98. 2 A.D. 330 90. \r\rCirca A.D. 536. 4 A.D. 1193 1280. \r\rCf. op. cit. col. 1446. \r\rLiberi., Tractatus I., Caput viii. \r\rCf. the passage in Jonson ; it is a description of some scenery eised in the \rMasque of Hymen, which represented "the three regions of air" : the middle region \r"all of dark and condensed clouds, as being the proper place where rain, hail, and \rother watery meteors are made " ; or as Averroes puts it in quo fiimt plitvia et nix \ret grando (Meteorologicorum Lib. i., Cap. IV.). \rLibtru., Tract, i., Cap. in. \r\r432 \r\r\r\r676 PARADISE LOST. \r\r&* medium & suprennim... medium frigidum excellenter & httmidum. \rNow let us summarise the results of these descriptions of the media \rregio, and see how they apply to the Miltonic "middle region." \r\r(1) The media regio is the place of clouds and heavy vapours; \rcf. P. R. i. 3941, where Satan \r\r"in mid air \r\rTo council summons all his mighty peers, \rWithin thick clouds and dark tenfold involved," \rand P. R. II. 117, where Satan ascends "Up to the middle region of \rthick air." Cf. also the piece In Qttintum Novembris^ 12, where M. \rmakes this region the gathering- place of storms : Hie tempestates media \rciet aere diras (the subject of the verb being Satan) ; and his Latin \racademic "prolusion" De Spherarum Concentu, where he mentions \rmedia, aeris regio. \r\r(2) It is peculiarly cold ; and \' cold \' is the precise epithet used in \rP. L. I. 516. Cf. The Death of a Fair Infant, 16, "Through middle \rempire of ft\\G freezing air. " \r\r(3) It extends to the top of high mountains ; and Mount Olympus \ris the dwelling-place of the deities who " rule the middle air," P. L. I. \r5I5 5i6. Cf. the Vacation Exercise, 41, 42. \r\r(4) It is capped by another, perhaps broader, belt of air ; and in \rP. L. i. 517 Milton expressly sneers at the "highest heaven" of the \rclassical deities as not being so very high after all which, according to \rthe whole system of this theory, is true enough. \r\rIt appears to me therefore that the explanation suggested fits the \rpassages at every turn. I imagine that to many of Milton\'s readers, as \rto many of the spectators of Jonson\'s Masque, the notion of the three \rregions was perfectly familiar 1 . From the frequency of Milton\'s own \rreferences to it we may infer that it appealed to his imagination. \r\r\r\rE. \rPARADISE LOST, I. 58287. \r\rThe enumeration of proper names is a favourite device with M., as \rwith many other poets, notably Vergil. Cf. the Nativity Ode, one of his \rearliest poems (1629), P. L. xi. 388 411, P. R. in. 270 et seq. The \r\r1 It has been pointed out to me that this conception of the media regio is \rexpounded in Sylvester\'s Du Bartas, a work so familiar to Milton : see Grosart\'s \red., i. 31. For another illustrative passage, cf. Burton\'s Anatomy, ninth ed., i. 380. \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 677 \r\rcharm of such passages lies in the musical sound of the names, in \rtheir historical or literary associations, and in the impression of vague \rremoteness and mystery that they convey. Bentley, however, with \rsomething more than his usual infelicity as a critic of M., omitted \rlines 579 87 (fr m "what resounds" to " Fontarabbia ") as being \r"Romantic Trash a heap of barbarous Words." Even Keightley \ropined that the names are chosen " somewhat at random " : whereas, in \rtruth, each has been carefully selected by M. for its associations. \r\rIn " all who since " Milton is thinking mainly of the great Italian \rpoems of chivalry with their accounts of contests between the Christians \r("baptized") and Saracens ("infidel" see 763 66, note): e.g. \rPulci\'s Morgante Maggiore, 1481 see the Areopagitica, P. W. II. 64; \rBoiardo\'s Orlando Innamorato, 1495, recast by Berni, 1541 see P. JR. \rIII. 338 43; Ariosto\'s Orlando Furioso, 1516, of which there was a \rfamous English version by Sir John Harington, 1591 see the extract \rfrom Ariosto in Of Reformation, P. W. n. 383 ; and Tasso\'s Gerusakmme \rLiberata. In a letter from Florence (1638), and elsewhere, M. manifests \rhis delight in Italian literature. \r\rAspramont (583) is situate 6 miles north of Nice. In Hexham\'s \rMercator (1636) I find it marked in the map of Provence, and \ragain in that of Italy. The castle belonging to the great family of the \rCounts of Aspramont may still be seen. Probably the literary allusion \ris to the Orlando Furioso, xi I. 43, where Aspramont is mentioned as \rthe scene of a feat of arms performed by Orlando ; and M. may have \rknown an Italian poem, entitled UAspramonte and published at \rVenice in 1532 itself, possibly, based on the French \'Chanson de \rGeste \' Aspremont) which deals with Charlemagne\'s conquest of Apulia. \rIn any case, it is pretty clear that \' Aspramont \' was a name familiar to \rreaders of medireval romances of chivalry : and does not Scott tell us of \rjousts at the castle of Aspramont for the hand of the \' Lady of Aspra- \rmonte\' (Count Robert of Paris)"} Also, as M. in his journey to Italy, \rrejecting the route by Marseilles to Genoa which Sir Henry Wotton \rrecommended (see Comus), passed through Nice (so he says in \rthe Defensio Secunda), he may conceivably have visited the famous \rcastle, and viewed the scene of the exploits of Orlando and other \rknights. The notion that Asprement in the Netherlands is meant \rneed only be mentioned to be dismissed. \r\rMontalban, or Montauban, is another famous name. It was the \rcastle, in Languedoc, of the Knight Renaud, the Rinaldo of Pulci\'s \rMorgante Maggiore and Boiardo\'s Orlando Innamorato. In the English \rromance "The Foure Sonnes of Aymon" (published by Caxton, about \r1489), Montalban is constantly mentioned as the scene of conflicts be- \r\r\r\r6/8 PARADISE LOST. \r\rtween Charlemagne\'s troops and Renaud who is besieged there (see the \rEarly English Text Society\'s ed., pp. 395422). Rodd in his Spanish \rBallads (1812) gives one "The Ancient Ballad of Count Claros of \rMontalban" (and another "The Ancient Ballad of the Battle of \rRoncesvalles "). \r\rIn " Damasco " the literary allusion is probably to the Orlando \rFurioso. In Harington\'s version the \'Argument\' to book xvn. says, \r"Mariano at Damaso? tilts " ; stanzas 12 20 of that book describe the \rcity, with the meeting of the champions there, and stanzas 58 73 their \rtournaments and jousts. No doubt, too, M. was thinking of Damascus \ras the scene of battles in times of the Crusades ; cf. Greene, Friar \rBacon, IV. 27, "The virtuous fame discoursed of his deeds. ..Done at \rthe Holy Land \'fore Damas\' walls," and vin. 113, "that famous \rPrince... Who at Damaso? beat the Saracens." Note that M. uses the \rform * Damasc0 \' here, but \' Damascw.r \' at 468 : the one suggests the \rmediaeval, the other the Scriptural, city. \r\rIn " Marocco " the wars between the Spaniards and the Moors are \rmeant. The form Marocco, given in the original editions here and in \rXI. 404, is closer to the Arabic form MarrAkush. \r\rTrebisond, Gk. Trapezus, in Cappadocia, was the seat of the empire \rof the family of the Grand-Komnenos from A.D. 1204 to 1461, when \rthe city was captured by Mohammed. Writers of the Middle Age and \rlater historians (Gibbon has only a brief allusion, vn. 327) celebrate \rthe extraordinary splendour of the court and magnificence of the city. \r"Never," says the historian of Trebizond, Professor Fallmerayer, "was \rthere a land more fitted to provide material for romances of chivalry \r(Rittcrgeschichtcri) " : Trebizond "became in popular romance and in \rthe imagination of the Italians and Provencals one of the most famous \rempires of the east, and the rallying point of the youth and flower of \rAsia" (Geschichtc dts Kaiserthums von Trapezunt}. Now the great \rexemplar of this romance associated with Trebizond (whose splendours \rwould naturally be reflected on Western Europe through an Italian \rmedium) was a heroic novel, // Caloandro, or // Caloandro Fedele, \rwritten by Giovanni Ambrosio Marini of Genoa, published at Bologna \rin 1641 (but I am not sure that this was the ist ed.), and often reprinted. \rThis work, which had some historical basis, was one of the most famous \rromances of the i7th cent. Twice translated into French (by Monsieur \rde Scudery, brother of the novelist, and by the Comte de Caylus), it \rmay have been Englished as was another novel by Marini, The \rDesperadoes\', and it seems to me quite likely that M. was thinking \rof it here, or at any rate that many of his readers would think of it. \rThose who knew the novel would recall the numerous jousts and \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 679 \r\rtournaments which take place at the court of Trebizond, e.g. the great \rcombat in book XXI. (it is a vast story) between the three champions of \rthe princess Tigrinde and the three representatives of the Persian and \rTartar armies with many similar scenes. It is worth while to add \rthat the author (Cardinal Bessarion) of the curious Laus Trapezuntis \rdwells on its tournaments and games as a special feature of the court ; \rand to remember how Scott makes the Templar say to Rebecca, \r" I won him (his horse, Zamor) in single fight from the Soldan of \rTrebizond" (Ivan/toe, chap. xliv.). \r\rIn line 585 the historical reference is to the Moorish invaders of \rSpain, the literary to book n. of the Orlando Innamorato> where we \rread how Agramant, * King of Africa,\' assembled his troops at Biserta \r(the ancient Utica) for invasion of Christendom, landed in Spain, \rand came up with the army qf Charlemagne, when "a bloody battle \rensued." \r\rThe event to which M. refers in lines 586, 587, was this : Charle- \rmagne, who had entered Spain to attack the Saracens, was retreating \rinto France, A.D. 778; his army had to pass through the defile of Ronces- \rvalles (or Roncesvaux) in N.W. Spain ; Charlemagne himself, with \rmain body, had got through the pass, when the rear-guard, through \rGanelon\'s treachery, was attacked in the pass by the Gascons (or \rBasques), and cut to pieces, among those who perished being the \rfamous Roland, whose death became the subject of numberless \r* Chansons de Gestes,\' such as the great Song of Roland (see Eginhardus, \rVita Caroli Magni^ cap. 9). \r\rFontarabbia is 40 miles from Roncesvalles : why does M. place the \rdisaster at the former ? Some will have it that he chose Fontarabbia \rbecause the name has a very pretty sound, and that "by Fontarabbia " \rwas quite accurate enough, in poetry. Some again say that M. \rfollowed the historian Mariana and \'other Spanish writers.\' Mariana, \rhowever, does not mention Fontarabbia at all, but gives the ordinary \rversion, that the battle was at Roncesvalles. There may be some literary \rallusion not yet traced. Scott happily combines the two names, \rMarmioti) VI. 33 : \r\r" O, for a blast of that dread horn, \rOn Fontarabian echoes borne, \r\rThat to king Charles did come, \rWhen Rowland brave, and Olivier, \rAnd every paladin and peer, \r\rOn Roncesvalles died." \r\rIt was at Fontarabbia that Wellington forced his way into France \ragainst Soult, over the ford of the river Bidassoa. \r\r\r\r68O PARADISE LOST. \r\rM. represents Charlemagne as having fallen in the fight, whereas \rhe lived till 814. Here again Milton\'s authority is not known; \rthough Mariana does speak of Charlemagne dying through chagrin at \rhis defeat soon after. But perhaps " fell " means \' was overthrown * ; \ras Dante says, "lost the holy emprise" (Inferno, xxxi. 16 18). \r\rMontaigne introduces the name Fontarabie in a short historical \ranecdote in his Essay (i. xv.) entitled "Of the punishment of \rCowardise " in Florio\'s translation (1603). \r\rIt may just be added that "peer" cf. "peerage" is the word \rregularly used of Charlemagne\'s nobles in the old poems and prose- \rromances translated from the French ; such as Caxton\'s Lyfe of Charles \rthe grete of France (1485) and the Fonre Sonnes of Aynion (1489, \rCaxton), both reprinted by the Early English Text Society. Cf. Huon \rof Bnrdeux, where it is said that at the battle of Roncesvalles "al y \rxii peres of france were slayne, except one " (p. 2). \r\r\r\rF. \rPARADISE LOST, I. 737. \r\rAccording to a mediaeval belief the Heavenly beings were divided \rinto three Hierarchies, and each Hierarchy was subdivided into three \rOrders or Choirs. These Orders comprised the Seraphim, Cherubim and \rThrones (0p6voi), forming the first Hierarchy; Dominations (KuptirTjrej), \rVirtues (5wd/tets) and Powers (^ou<r/cu), forming the second; Princi- \rpalities (dpxai), Archangels and Angels, forming the third. This \rsystem was deduced, in the main, from St Paul\'s words in Ephes. i. 21 \rand Colos. i. 16. First formulated in the treatise irepl TTJI ovpavias \rIcpapxio-s, which was long attributed, though falsely, to Dionysius the \rAreopagite, the notion had great influence in the Middle Ages; cf. \rDante, Paradise, X. 115 17, XXVin. 98 126. Allusions to it are \rfrequent in Elizabethan writers. Works from which many illustrations \rof the system might be quoted are: Batman vppon Bartholome (1582), \rReginald Scot\'s Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584), Thomas Watson\'s \rEglogue (1590), the Faust-book (1587), Spenser\'s Fowre Hymnes \r(Heavenly Love and Heavenly Beautie), Bacon, Advancement of \rLearning, I. vi. 3, Drummond, Flowers of Sion (Works, II. 42, 51), \rSir Thomas Browne, Religio Medici, I. Iviii., and Heywood\'s Hierarchic \rof the Blessed Angels (1635), which deals with the subject at great \rlength. \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 68 1 \r\rMilton accepted l the tradition and made it the basis of the whole \rangelical system of Paradise Lost. \r\rEach of the Orders possessed some special quality. The Seraphim \rwere the "burning" lustrous beings; cf. Spenser, An Hymne of Heavenly \rfieautie, 95, 96 : \r\r"And those eternall burning Seraphins, \r\rWhich from their faces dart out fierie light." \r\rThis conception, due probably to the false derivation of Seraphim from \ra root signifying \'to burn,\' determines Milton\'s choice of epithets for \rthis Order of Hierarchies. It is a common allusion in the poets ; cf. the \rEssay on Man, I. 109, 1 10 (of the " poor Indian ") : \r" To be, contents his natural desire, \r\rHe asks no angel\'s wings, no Seraph\'s fire"; \r\rand again 277, 278. So the Seraphim "are represented in medieval \rart with the colour of flame or crimson." \r\rThe Cherubim had a wondrous power of vision : hence their main \rduty in Paradise Lost is to keep watch. See IV. 778 80. And \rthrough this power of vision they enjoyed in a peculiar degree the \rVisio Beatifica or faculty of " contemplating " the Deity. In the words \rof the treatise irepl TTJS iepapxla-s they were distinguished 5ia TO OCOTTTIKOV \ravTu>i> Kal BewprjTiKdif. And this notion is the key to that difficult line \r(54) in // Penseroso, " The Cherub Contemplation." \r\rThe archangels were, as their name implied, the "chief messengers" \rof the Almighty and the intermediaries between him and Man. Cf. \rReginald Scot, "As for archangels, they are sent onlie about great and \rsecret matters"; and Heywood, "The Archangels are Embassadors, \rgreat matters to declare." Hence Milton makes Raphael in book v. \rand Michael in books XI., xn., each one of the seven archangels \rreferred to in in. 648 53, the bearers of messages and charges from \rthe Almighty to Adam. \r\rOne other point in which Milton follows mediaeval tradition with \rregard to the Heavenly beings may be noticed. Descriptions like \rthose in book in. 625 28 and 636 42 are purely traditional. We \rmust compare them with the presentment of angels in works of early \rChristian art. Poets and painters alike drew upon religious tradition \rand expressed it by certain conventional details. And this presentment \rof angelic beings contained a considerable element of symbolism. In \rBatman vppon Bartholome, II. iii., iv., there is a long discourse on the \r\r1 Thus in The Reason of Church Government, I. 2, he says, " the angels them- \rselves. ..are distinguished and quaternioned into their celestial princedoms and \rsatrapies," P. W. n. 442. He several times uses the special terms "Orders" and \r"Hierarchies" cf. P. L. i. 737, v. 591, vn. 192; while the titles "Seraphim," \r"Thrones," "Dominations," "Virtues" etc. occur constantly. \r\r\r\r682 PARADISE LOST. \r\rattributes which painters assign to angels and on their symbolical signi- \rficance. The following brief extracts from it illustrate Milton\'s pictures \rof Uriel and the " stripling Cherub ": " When Angells are paynted with \rlong lockes and crispe haire, thereby is understoode their cleane \raffections and ordinate thoughts. For the hayre of the head be- \rtokeneth thoughts and affections that doe spring out of the roote of \rthought and minde...And they be painted beardles: for to take con- \rsideration and heede, that they passe never the state of youth, neyther \rwaxe feeble in vertues, neither faile for age...Truely they be paynted \rfeathered and winged... [as a sign that] they be lifted up in effect and \rknowledge, and rauished to the uttermost contemplation of the loue \rof God." \r\r\r\rG. \r\rPARADISE LOST, in. 2226. \r\r" Drop serene " is a literal rendering of gutta senna, the technical \rLatin term for "complete amaurosis," i.e. amaurosis or disease of the \roptic nerve in its worst form. It involves total blindness. " Suffusion " \r(Greek uir6xw*a Latin suffusio) was also a technical term, employed \rthen by medical writers to denote imperfection or loss of sight \rin general, whether caused by cataract or by affection of the nervous \rstructure. Blindness of the latter type is sometimes called suffusio nigra. \rMilton\'s blindness was probably due to amaurosis, since that \rdisease commonly makes no external change in the eye. Thus he says \rin the Second Defence , " so little do they [his eyes] betray any external \rappearance of injury, that they are as unclouded and bright as the eyes \rof those who most distinctly see" (P. W. I. 235). \rCf. also his second Sonnet to Cyriack Skinner : \r" Cyriack, this three years\' day these eyes, though clear, \rTo outward view, of blemish or of spot, \rBereft of light, their seeing have forgot." \r\rHis weakness of sight was evidently inherited from his mother. \rAubrey in his Life of Milton says : " His father read without spectacles \rat 84. His mother had very weake sight." \r\rMilton undoubtedly believed that his loss of physical eyesight was \rcompensated by increased spiritual illumination : \r\r"So much the rather thou, celestial Light, \rShine inward, and the mind through all her powers \rIrradiate" (ill. 5153). \rWith these lines we may compare a sentence in one of his letters : \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 683 \r\r"why should I not submit with complacency to this loss of sight, which \rseems only withdrawn from the body without, to increase the sight \rof the mind within?" (P. W. ill. 513). He writes to the same effect \rin the Second Defence : ** Let me then be the most feeble creature alive, \ras long as that feebleness serves to invigorate the energies of my rational \rand immortal spirit ; as long as in that obscurity, in which I am en- \rveloped, the light of the divine presence more clearly shines, then, in \rproportion as I am weak, I shall be invincibly strong ; and in proportion \ras I am blind, I shall see more clearly. O ! that I may thus be perfected \rby feebleness, and irradiated by obscurity. And, indeed, in my blindness, \rI enjoy in no inconsiderable degree the favour of the Deity, who regards \rme with more tenderness and compassion in proportion as I am able to \rbehold nothing but himself" (P. IV. I. 239). Cf. Samson Agonistes, \r162, 163 and 1687 89; and Wordsworth, The Excursion, I. 95. \r\rOne of the finest allusions in literature to Milton\'s affliction is in \rGray\'s lines on him in The Progress of Poesy ; as the third couplet of \rthem contains a reference to Paradise Lest, ill. 380 82, they may not \rinappropriately be cited here : \r\r\' \' Nor second He, that rode sublime \rUpon the seraph-wings of Extasy, \rThe secrets of th\' Abyss to spy. \r\rHe pass\'d the flaming bounds of Place and Time: \rThe living Throne, the sapphire blaze, \rWhere Angels tremble, while they gaze, \rHe saw; but, blasted with excess of light, \rClos\'d his eyes in endless night." \r\rDryden seems to have anticipated Gray in the reference ; cf. The Hind \rand the Panther, I. 64 69 : \r\r"But gracious God, how well dost Thou provide \rFor erring judgments an unerring guide ! \rThy throne is darkness in the abyss of light, \rA blaze of glory that forbids the sight. \rO teach me to believe Thee thus concealed, \rAnd search no farther than Thy self revealed." \r\r\r\rH. \rPARADISE LOST, in. 43139. \r\rThe geography of this passage has been criticised adversely on the \rassumption that " Imaus " must mean the Himalayas. A bird flying \rfrom the Himalayas to the sources of the Ganges would not pass over \r\r\r\r684 PARADISE LOST. \r\rany part of \' Sericana,\' by which, probably, the north-west angle of the \rChinese Empire was signified. Masson, to meet the supposed difficulty, \rargues that the vulture is not said to start from Imaus : it is only \r" bred" there. But I think that Milton does mean us to regard Imaus \ras the starting-point of the bird\'s flight. \r\r" Imaus," however, need not mean the Himalayas in this passage. \rTrue, the earlier classical geographers applied "Imaus" to the \rHimalayas (the names being cognate) ; but in Ptolemy and later writers \rthe name is transferred to the great chain of mountains, the Bolor \rrange, which runs through Central Asia from North to South, dividing \rthe Chinese Empire from Turkestan. And this later use 1 of " Imaus" \rappears to have been that recognised by geographers of the iyth \rcentury. Perhaps the best known collection of maps issued in England \rbetween 1600 and 1650 was the English edition 2 of Mercator\'s Atlas ^ \rdoubtless known to Milton. \r\rNow, in Mercator\'s map of Tartaria there is marked a chain of \rmountains called Imaus Mons. It extends, roughly speaking, from \rthe north-eastern corner of the modern Afghanistan to the "Frozen \rOcean," i.e. Arctic Ocean. Its course is due North and South. When \rMilton speaks of "Imaus" which bounds the "roving Tartars" he \rmeans, I doubt not, this Imaus Mons which is so conspicuous \rin Mercator\'s Tartaria. And any one who could consult this rare \rAtlas would perceive at once the accuracy of Milton\'s description. For \rthe northern part of Imaus Mons does " bound " the Tartar, sepa- \rrating his country from Russia; and a vulture starting from this \rnorthern part and flying southward to the Ganges would pass over the \rnorth-west plains of the Chinese Empire. Judged therefore from the \r1 7th century standpoint the geography of the passage is quite correct. \rOf course, very little was known then about Central Asia. Mercator \rfrankly calls it "that vast and unknown region." \r\rAllusions to the passage occur in the Dunciad^ in. 76, "He [the \rEmperor of China] whose long wall the wandering Tartar bounds," and \rin Thomson\'s Autumn : \r\r"From Asian Taurus, from Imaus stretch \'d \rAthwart the roving Tartar\'s sullen bounds." \r\r1 Cf. Pliny\'s Natural History. "Above those, are other Scythians called \rAnthropophagi. ..within a certain vale of the mountaiiie Imaus," Philemon Holland\'s \rtranslation, 1601, p. 154. \r\r- Hexham\'s, 1636. \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 685 \r\rI. \r\rPARADISE LOST, iv. -27579. \r\rThe key to this passage, as Bishop Newton pointed out, is in \rDiodorus Siculus III. 67 70. Diodorus relates various legends as \rto the birth of Dionysus or Bacchus ; amongst them is the following. \r\rThere was a King of Libya named Ammon. He married Rhea y \rdaughter of the god Uranus. By a maiden called Amaltheia he had a \rson. To save the mother and child from the jealousy of Rhea, Ammon \rhid them in a place called Nysa, on an island off the Mediterranean \rcoast of Libya, not far from the modern Tunis. It was " girt with the \rriver Triton " (irepiexof^vrj vird rov Tplruvos iroTa/j.ov), and a spot of \rmost singular beauty and fertility. Here the infant was brought up \rin a cave ; and Ammon appointed the goddess Athene to guard him \r"against the plots of his step-mother Rhea" (irpos rets ct7r6 TTJJ wrpvias \r\'Ptas eTTtjSouXds). The child grew up, showed wonderful wisdom, \rand having invented wine, became the god of wine. He was named \r" Dionysus" from Nysa his place of nurture. \r\rThis monarch Ammon is evidently a kind of deity, and Milton \ridentifies him with the god whom the Greeks called Zetts Ammon and \rthe Romans Jupiter Ammon, and who is commonly associated with the \rEgyptian sun-god Amon Ra. As in several other passages, Milton \rhas followed Diodorus very closely, merely translating one or two sen- \rtences; cf. the references to "the river Triton" and "his step-dame \rRhea." \r\rCham, of course, is identical with Ham, the name of Noah\'s son ; \rcf. the Septuagint form of Ham, viz. Xci,u, and the Vulgate form, Cham. \rProbably Milton had some patristic authority for the identification of the \rScriptural Cham or Ham with the " Gentile 1 " deity Ammon, also called \rHammond : an identification obviously due to the similarity of the names, \rand strengthened by the traditional account that Egypt 3 was colonised \rby the descendants of Ham. Tennyson speaks of " the Chamian oracle \rdivine," i.e. the shrine of Cham t meaning the famous temple of Jupiter \r\r1 Note "Whom Gentiles Ammon call" (iv. 277), i.e. the Greeks and Romans; \rthe implied antithesis between "Gentile" and Biblical shows that "Cham" in 276 \rrefers to a Scriptural character, i.e. Noah\'s son. \r\r2 Cf. M. in the Nativity Ode, 203, " The Libyc Hamtnon shrinks his horn." \r8 Cf. Psalm cv. 23, where Egypt is called " the land of Ham." \r\r\r\r686 PARADISE LOST. \r\rAmmon in the heart of the Libyan desert. And this is the allusion in \rThomson\'s lines (Liberty, in) : \r\r\' \' the Libyan sands \r\rWhere Ammon lifts amid the torrid waste \rA verdant isle, with shade and fountain fresh." \rIt may be added that romantic, more or less mythical, island-retreats \rlike " that Nyseian isle " were an indispensable feature of the literary \rgeography of the epic and quasi-epic world. There was, e.g. the \r" Nilotic isle," Meroe (Paradise Regained, iv. 71); "the fairest and \rmost famous" of the islands in the Nile, says Sandys, Relation, p. 93. \rTasso\'s isle of Armida belonged to much the same category; and \rthe enchantress Acrasia was similarly secluded, The Faerie Queene, \rII. 12. See also Comus, 517. \r\r\r\rJ- \r\rPARADISE LOST, VH. 112. \r\rMilton\'s invocation is addressed to the Muse of sacred song and \rinspiration the Heavenly power which "taught" Moses on Sinai \r(i. 6 10), and inspired David on Sion (HI. 29 32) and the other \rprophets and singers of Israel. It is to her that he appeals at the \rbeginning of the poem " Sing, Heavenly Muse," and there is a special \rappropriateness in lines 6 10. Cf. Addison\'s remark: "His invo- \rcation to a work which turns in a great measure upon the creation of \rthe World, is very properly made to the muse who inspired Moses in \rthose books from whence our author drew his subject, and to the Holy \rSpirit who is therein represented as operating after a particular manner \rin the first production of nature." \r\rAs to the character of this divine power whose existence he postu- \rlates, he does not, naturally, speak with definiteness: in I. 17 26 he \rexpressly distinguishes her from the Holy Spirit; in P. R. i. 8 17 he \rseems to identify them. \r\rThe important point is that for Milton this " Heavenly Muse " is a \rtruly divine power, in whom he believes with a conviction which gives \rintense reality to his invocations. \r\rWith the classical poets (Homer perhaps excepted) the invocation of \rthe Muse was, I suppose, merely a literary convention a piece of the \rtraditional * machinery \' of poetry : one does not credit Horace with \rmuch faith in the Calliope whom he begged to "descend from Heaven." \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 687 \r\rMilton has faith, and when he asks Urania to aid him he means every \rword of his petition. \r\rIt is in virtue too of his assistance by this higher and holier power \rthan the classical poets knew of that he speaks of his poetry as soaring \r"above" theirs. Compare vn. 3, 4 and I. 12 15, where, addressing \rthe " Heavenly Muse," he says : \r\r"I \r\rInvoke thy aid to my adventurous song, \rThat with no middle flight intends to soar \rAbove the Aonian mount" (i.e. Mt Helicon). \r\rHe does not, I think, intend to suggest that he will surpass, say, \rVergil as an artist as a master of style and imagery and other qualities \rwhich constitute the art of poetry; but only that he is filled with a \rhigher inspiration to treat of higher things. In fact, his claim is to \rmoral, not artistic, superiority ; it resolves itself almost into the differ- \rence between Christianity and Paganism. We should remember that \rin Milton\'s eyes the poet is a teacher in the first place, a singer in the \rsecond : he must write " to God\'s glory, by the honour and instruction \rof his country," and be "an interpreter and relater of the best andsagest \rthings among his own citizens." See the preface to book u. of The \rReason of Church Government, and cf. the Introduction to this volume. \rThe name " Urania" which he assigns to his Muse means, of course, \r1 the Heavenly One,\' Gk. otpavla 1 . In classical mythology Urania was \rcommonly regarded as the Muse of astronomy; compare a poem on \r" The Muses" by Nicholas Grimald: \r\r" Uranie, her globes to view all bent, \r\rThe ninefolde heauen observes with fixed face 8 ." \rIn these lines Urania evidently typifies astronomy according to the \rordinary classical conception of her attributes ; and a similar illustra- \rtion might be cited from Sylvester\'s Du Bartas (Grosart\'s ed., n. 3). \rIn treating Urania otherwise than as the Muse of astronomy Milton had \rbeen anticipated by other poets. Perhaps the earliest was Dante ; cf. \rthe Purgatorio, xxix. 4042 : " Now \'tis meet that Helicon for me \rstream forth and Urania aid me with her choir to set in verse things 3 \rhard to conceive." Dante had been followed by English poets. Spenser, \rfor example, in The Ttares of the Muses makes her represent the highest \rknowledge "the heavenlie light of knowledge "; while for Drummond \rof Hawthornden she meant, it would seem, the power of spiritual wisdom, \rone section of his poems being entitled " Urania, or Spiritual Poems." \r\r1 See Hesiod, Theogony 78. \r\r* Tottel\'s Miscellany. 1557, e d. Arber, p. 100. \r\r1 Cf. Milton\'s Dantesque use of "things," P. L. i. 16. \r\r\r\r688 PARADISE LOST. \r\rInfluenced, no doubt, by Paradise Lost, vil. i et seq., Shelley in Adonais > \rII. iv., and Tennyson in In Memoriam regard Urania as the Muse of \rlofty verse : a conception very similar to Milton\'s though less dis- \rtinctively religious. And Wordsworth has two directly Miltonic allu- \rsions to Urania ; cf. the invocation in The Recluse : \r\r" Urania, I shall need \rThy guidance, or a greater Muse, if such \rDescend to earth or dwell in highest heaven ! " \rand the end of his poem on Ossian : \r\r"such was blind \rMaeonides of ample mind, \rSuch Milton, to the fountain-head \rOf glory by Urania led ! " \rThe " Urania " of Matthew Arnold\'s poem is less easily defined. \r\r\r\rK. \r\rPARADISE LOST, vm. 8084. \r\rIn his note on this passage Professor Masson says: "The funda- \rmental notion of the ancient astronomers was that all the motions of \rthe heavenly bodies were in circles, the strictly circular motion being \rthe most perfect kind.... From very remote antiquity, however, it had \rbeen perceived that the simple circular motions of eight or even ten \rspheres round the Earth, with whatever variety of rates and times among \rthemselves, would not account for all the observed phenomena of the \rheavens, would not account, for example, for the fact that the motion \rof the Sun is faster or slower according to the season (acceleration and \rretardation), or for the fact that the motions of the planets are sometimes \rdirect, or in the order of the signs of the Zodiac, and sometimes \rretrograde (progression and regression). To remedy this defect, \' to \rsave these appearances,\' two devices had been introduced, that of the \rEccentric and that of the Epicycle. \r\r4 \'Let it be supposed that, while the Earth is the centre of the Primum \rMobile [i.e. the outermost of the spheres] and consequently of the \rwhole mundane system, the inclosed planetary spheres, or at all events \rthat of the Sun, need not be strictly concentric, i.e. need not strictly \rhave this centre, but may be eccentric, i.e. may revolve round a point \rsomewhat to the side of the Earth ; then, as the Earth would sometimes \rbe nearer to the moving body, and sometimes farther off, the accelera- \rtion or retardation of the motion would be sufficiently accounted for. \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 689 \r\r" Again, let it be supposed that the body of a planet is not fixed strictly \rin its cycle, or the circumference of its wheeling sphere, but moves \rflylike in an epicycle, or small circle revolving round a fixed point in \rthat wheeling circumference ; then, according as the planet was in that \rpart of its epicycle which is beyond, or in that part which is within, its \rcycle, its motion would for the time be progressive, i.e. with its cycle, \ror retrograde, i.e. against its cycle. Actually, by a complicated use of \rthese two devices,... the Ptolemaic astronomers had contrived, with a \rtolerable approach to completeness, to account for all the phenomena of \rthe solar and planetary motions, but only by such a dizzying intricacy \rof conceived wheels within wheels (\'centric and eccentric" 1 ) and wheels \rupon wheels (\' cycle and epicycle" 1 } as Milton describes." \r\rThere is a great deal about these theories of the Eccentric and \rEpicycle in Burton\'s Anatomy of Melancholy, ir. i. in, the chapter \rentitled "a Digression of the Ayre"; see especially pp. 381, 382, 384 \rin the ninth edition (1800). Like Milton, he ridicules the too-ingenious \rspeculations of astronomers, who, " to solve all appearances and \robjections, have invented new hypotheses, and fabricated new systems \rof the World... The World is tossed in a blanket amongst them, they \rhoyse the Earth up and down like a ball, make it stand and go at their \rpleasures " (pp. 388, 389). \r\rCompare also Bacon\'s Essay Of Superstition : \r\r"It was gravely said of the prelates in the Council of Trent, where \rthe doctrine of the Schoolmen bare great sway, that the Schoolmen \rwere like astronomers, which did feign eccentrics and epicycles, and \rsuch engines of orbs, to save tht phenomena 1 , though they knew there \rwere no such things ; and, in like manner, that the Schoolmen had \rframed a number of subtle and intricate axioms and theorems to save the \rpractice of the Church." See also his Essay Of Wisdom for a Man\'s \rSelf. \r\rSo in The Advancement of Learning, n. 8. 5 : \r\r"As the same phenomena in astronomy are satisfied by the received \rastronomy of the diurnal motion, and the proper motions of the planets, \rwith their eccentrics and epicycles, and likewise by the theory of \rCopernicus, who supposed the earth to move, and the calculations are \rindifferently agreeable to both, so the ordinary face and view of \rexperience is many times satisfied by several theories and philosophies ; \rwhereas to find the real truth requireth another manner of severity and \rattention" (Clarendon ed., p. 127). \r\rSir Thomas Browne uses this astronomical metaphor in charac- \rteristic fashion: \r\r1 Echoed, perhaps, in Milton\'s phrase (vm. 82). \rP. L. 44 \r\r\r\r690 PARADISE LOST. \r\r"In philosophy, where truth seems double-faced, there is no man \rmore paradoxical than myself: but in divinity I love to keep the road ; \rand, though not in an implicit, yet an humble faith, follow the great \rwheel of the Church, by which I move ; not reserving any proper \rpoles, or motion from the epicycle of my own brain" (Religio Medici, \rI. vi.). \r\rCompare too his Christian Morals, I. xix.: " Hang early plummets \rupon the heels of pride, and let ambition have but an epicycle and \rnarrow circuit in thee." \r\rFor eccentric, see the note on v. 623, and compare one of Milton\'s \rfavourite astronomical metaphors in The Reason of Church Government, \rI. i : \r\r"Yet is it to be conceived that.. .our happiness ["of the blessed in \rparadise "] may orb itself into a thousand vagancies of glory and delight, \rand with a kind of eccentrical equation be, as it were, an invariable \rplanet of joy and felicity" (P. W. n. 442). \r\r\r\rL. \r\rPARADISE LOST, ix. 25-41. \r\rIt was a subject of discussion among Milton\'s early critics whether \rParadise Lost should be called " heroic." The question was first raised \rby Dryden in the Discourse on Satire (1693) prefixed to his translation \rof Juvenal, thus : \r\r"As for Mr Milton, whom we all admire with so much justice, his \rsubject is not that of an heroic poem, properly so called. His design \ris the losing of our happiness ; his event [i.e. end, termination] is not \rprosperous, like that of all other epic works ; his heavenly machines are \rmany, and his human persons are but two." And, " besides questioning \rwhether * Paradise Lost \' was an heroic poem, Dryden had argued [in the \rpreface to Vergil\\ that the devil was the hero and not Adam 1 ." \r\rAddison said : " I shall waive the discussion of that point, which was \rstarted some years since, whether Milton\'s \' Paradise Lost \' may be \rcalled an heroic poem. Those who will not give it that title may call it \r(if they please) a divine poem." Addison held that an heroic poem \rshould not end unhappily and that therefore Paradise Lost, to this \rextent, forfeits the title " heroic " ; but he argued that the defect was \rinherent in the subject, and that Milton showed exquisite judgment and \rinvention in remedying it (see the note on XI. 35658). \r\r1 C. H. Firth, Johnson\'s Lift of Milton, p. 135. Several of the passages in this \rsection are taken from his full note. \r\r\r\rAPPENDIX. 691 \r\rJohnson dealt with the objection more summarily : \r"The questions, whether the action of the poem be strictly one, \rwhether the poem can be properly termed heroic, and who is the hero, \rare raised by such readers as draw their principles of judgment rather \rfrom books than from reason. Milton, though he entitled \' Paradise Lost \' \ronly a \' poem,\' yet calls it himself \' heroic song.\' Dryden petulantly and \rindecently denies the heroism of Adam, because he was overcome ; but \rthere is no reason why the hero should not be unfortunate, except \restablished practice, since success and virtue do not go necessarily \rtogether. Cato is the hero of Lucan ; but Lucan\'s authority will not be \rsuffered by Quintilian to decide. However, if success be necessary, \rAdam\'s deceiver was at last crushed ; Adarri was restored to his Maker\'s \rfavour, and therefore may securely resume his human rank." \r\rThe ordinary conception of an " heroical " poem would have been \rfulfilled more obviously, at least, if Milton had carried out his design of \ra poem on King Arthur 1 or King Alfred 3 . \r\r\r\rM. \rPARADISE LOST, x. 658-62. \r\rDr Masson illustrates the astrological terms in these lines by a passage \rtranslated from "an old Latin catechism or text-book of Astronomy \r(Bebelius, De Sphara, 1582) "; it runs as follows: \r\r" What are the aspects of planets ? They are such arrangements and \rdistances of the planets as allow them to intercommunicate their \rinfluence. How many species of aspects are there? Five Conjunction, \rSextile, Square, Trine, and Diametral or Opposition. What is the \rfirst? The first kind of aspects, called Conjunction, is when two stars \ror planets are conjoined and as it were connected in one line ; by the \rGreeks it is called Synod. What is the Sextile aspect? When two \rplanets or stars are distant from each other a sixth part of the Zodiac, \rviz. two signs or 60. What is the Square aspect (quadratus aspechis) ? \rWhen two stars look at each other at an interval of three signs, making \ra quadrant or 90. What is Trine (Trigonus] aspect? When the \rdistance of the stars measures a third of the circle, that is 120 or four \rsigns. What is the Diametral aspect ? It is the opposite configuration \r\r1 See Introduction. \r\r2 Cf. the Cambridge MSS. : " A Heroicall Poem may be founded somewhere in \rAlfreds reigne." Curiously enough, of all the subjects enumerated in the MSS., this \ris the only one to which he applies the word " heroical." \r\r442 \r\r\r\r692 PARADISE LOST. \r\rof two luminaries, which are distant from each other 180 or half a \rcircle.... \r\r" How are the aspects divided ? Into happy and unhappy. Which \rare the happy and prosperous aspects? The prosperous and benign are \rthe Trine 1 and Sextile. Why are they called happy ? Because the rays \rof the planets, falling obliquely and mutually yielding, infuse and \rcommunicate to inferior bodies gentler and less violent influences. What \rare the unhappy aspects? The unhappy or malignant are Conjunction\'-, \rSquare, and Opposition 3 . Why are they called malignant? Because \rthe planets, meeting each other with their rays, mutually collide, and \rneither can yield to the other on account of the directness of their onset. \rTherefore they exercise greater force in stimulating and varying seasons, \rand in mixing the temperaments of animals and the qualities of the air. \rWhence is this variety of effects known? The effect and variety of \rconfiguration were first observed in the case of the Moon, and afterwards \rtransferred to the other planets by artists (artifices} who, by great \rsharpness of intelligence, and more attentive observation, endeavoured \rto find out and display the causes of events from the very nature of the \rheavenly motions and the species of the aspects." Dr Masson adds, \r"Milton, it will be noted, names all the aspects, giving Conjunction its \rGreek name of Synod." Milton had used very similar astrological \rlanguage in one of his pamphlets on divorce (Tetrachordon): \r\r"For nature hath her zodiac also, keeps her great annual circuit \rover human things, as truly as the sun and planets in the firmament ; \rhath her anomalies, hath her obliquities in ascensions and declinations, \raccesses and recesses, as blamelessly as they in heaven. And sitting in \rher planetary orb with two reins in each hand, one strait, the other \rloose, tempers the course of minds as well as bodies to several con- \rjunctions and oppositions, friendly or unfriendly aspects, consenting \roftest with reason, but never contrary" (P. W. in. 403). \r\rl Cf. Dryden, Annus Mirabilis, st. 292 : \r\r"Now frequent trines the happier lights among, \r\rAnd high-raised Jove from his dark prison freed, \rThose weights took off that on his planet hung, \r\rWill gloriously the new-laid work succeed" (i.e. make to succeed) \rIn his note (Clarendon ed., p. 259) Mr Christie gives other illustrations from Dryden \r(who "was learned in astrology and a firm believer"), e.g. his Ode to the Memory \rof Mrs Ann Killegrew\\ \r\r" For sure the milder planets did combine \rOn thy auspicious horoscope to shine \rAnd even the most malicious were in trine." \r\r8 Cf. 2 Henry IV. \\\\. 4. 286, 287. Selden in his Table~Talk has a section (xxvi.) \ron the "Great Conjunction" (of Saturn and Jupiter). \r\ra Cf. Richard III. iv. 4. 215, " Lo, at their births good stars were opposite," and \r402, " Be opposite all planets of good luck." \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. \r\r\r\rMilton\'s diction is essentially Elizabethan: the diction of the \rAuthorised Version (1611) of the Bible and of Shakespeare. Paradise \rLost, therefore, though published in 1667, is best illustrated from the \rworks of the generation contemporary with Shakespeare. Hence many \rof the illustrations in the Glossary and Notes are taken from the writers \rwho may collectively and conveniently be described as Elizabethan. \r\rA marked feature of Milton\'s diction, as of his style, is his classical \rbias. He employs many words in their classical sense, just as he \remploys many classical idioms and figures of speech. This classicism \rof diction is still more conspicuous in his prose, in which he introduces \rnumbers of long, sonorous words derived from the Latin. Sometimes \rhe invents such words. Paradise Lost contains innumerable examples \rof his classical diction. \r\rAnother interesting feature is his partiality for Italianised forms. \rThis is more conspicuous in his verse, perhaps because he felt so \rstrongly, and wished his readers to be reminded of, the spell and \rfascination of the great Italian epics. By his own statement, he had \rstudied Italian much before he went to Italy. His letters and prose- \rworks reveal his love of it (I do not remember any interesting reference \rin his works to French literature) ; and several short poems testify to \rhis very considerable mastery of the language. Instances of his leaning \rtowards Italian are ammiral, harald, Soldan, sovran ; sdein (iv. 50), \rserenate (iv. 769) ; azuru, Ital. azzurrino (Comus, 893). \r\rAbassin, iv. 280, \' Abyssinian.\' Abyssinia is from Arabic Habcsch, \r* mixture, confusion,\' a name given to the country by the Arabs on \raccount of the mixed character of its inhabitants. This Arabic word \rwas Latinised by the Portuguese as Abassia and Abasstnos, whence the \rpresent form. \r\rabide, iv. 87; cf. Julius Ceesar, in. 2. 119, "If it be found so, \rsome will dear abide it," i.e. suffer for it. This sense is given in the \r\r\r\r694 PARADISE LOST. \r\rold Dictionaries^ such as Cotgrave\'s (161 1), and Minsheu\'s Guide into the \rTongues (1625). The metaphor is \'to await the consequences of a deed \rand so, in the end, to pay for it.\' Probably abide in this sense has been \rinfluenced by, though etymologically quite distinct from, aby, * to ex- \rpiate, pay for\' = A.S. intensive prefix d + bycgan, \'to buy.\' \r\rabject, I. 312, \'cast down,\' the literal sense of Lat. abjectus, the \rpast participle of abjicere, \' to cast away or down.\' In Tindale\'s New \rTestament (1534), 2 Cor. vii. 6 is rendered "He that comfortith the \rabjecte" = " those that are cast down" in the Authorised Version. \rFor the ordinary figurative use cf. ix. 572. \r\rabuse, i. 479, \' to deceive, delude \' ; cf. Fr. abuser (Lat. abuti, \' to \rmisuse\'). This is a common Elizabethan use; cf. Cymbeline, ill. 4. \r123, King Lear, IV. i. 24. \r\rabyss, i. 21, 658; Lat. abyssus, from Gk. aj3u<ro-os, \'bottomless* \rd-, \' not \' + fiv<rff6t, \'bottom, depth.\' Shakespeare always uses the older \rform abysm, from Fr. abisme; cf. The Tempest, I. 2. 50, "In the dark \rbackward and abysm of time." \r\radmire, I. 690, n. 677, \' to wonder,\' the literal sense of Lat. admirari. \rCf. admiration^ \'wonder,\' III. 271, and in Hamlet, in. 2. 339, "your \rbehaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration"; and \radmirable \' to be wondered at,\' in A Midsummer- Nighfs Dream, v. 27. \r\radust, xi. 635, \' dried, scorched \' ; the p.p. of the verb adttre, Lat. \radttrere\'i cf. VI. 514. We also find a noun, adustion. "It was a tall \rfigure, of a philosophic, serious, adust look," A Sentimental Journey \r("The Mystery"). \r\radvise, n. 376, \' to consider \' ; often used reflexively in this sense, like \rFr. s\'aviser, \'to consider.\' Cf. i Chronicles xxi. 12, "advise thyself \rwhat word I shall bring again to him that sent me " (Revised Version \r"consider"). \r\ralarmed, iv. 985; Fr. a/on=Ital. a//\' arme, \'to arms!\' (Lat. ad \rilia arma) ; so that properly an alarm was a summons to take up arms, \ri.e. prepare for battle. Here alarmed means that Satan was prepared \rfor the fight not that he was afraid. Dryden (y. in. 313, 314) \rhas the phrase take alarm (vi. 549) : \r\r"Misenus sounds a charge: we take th\' alarm, \rAnd our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm." \r\ralchymy, n. 517, \' metal \' ; properly alchemy, from Arabic alkimia : \r#/=\'the\' (Arabic article), + ktmid, a corruption of x^ a use d in late Gk. \rfor the chemical transmutation of metals. Probably x 1 ?/"\'* was the Gk. \rform of the native name of Egypt ( = \' the land of Khem \'), and meant \r\' the Egyptian art.\' Later, through confusion with \\te(.v, \' to pour\' (cf. \rs, \' sap, juice \'), there arose a form xv/xela : whence in E. the old \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 695 \r\rspellings \'alchymy,\' \'alchmie,\' and \'chemist* (short for \'alchemist\'). \rFrom meaning the art of amalgamating metals \' alchemy \' came to be \rused of the amalgam or metallic composition produced by the process. \rA certain amalgam, like gold, was called \'alchemy gold\' or \'alchemy\'; \rcf. Fletcher, Purple Island, VII. 39, " Such were his arms, false gold, \rtrue alchymie." This mixed metal, in which brass was the chief \rconstituent, was much employed for trumpets (n. 517). \r\ralley, iv. 626, \'a garden-walk,\' especially one "with branches \rovergrown" (iv. 617). Cf. Much Ado About Nothing, I. 2. TO, "a \rthick-pleached alley," i.e. thickly interwoven overhead ; and Tennyson, \rOde to Memory, 5 : \r\r"Or a garden bower\'d close \r\rWith plaited alleys of the trailing rose." \rO. Fr. alee, Fr. allte. \r\rAlp, n. 620 ; formerly used, like Alpes in late Latin poets, of any \rhigh (especially snow-capped) mountain. Cf. S. A. 628, "Nor breath \rof vernal air from snowy Alp"; and Hakluyt\'s Voyages, I. 112, \r" Certaine Alpes or Mountaines directly Southward." So the Italians \ruse alpestro-^ steep, alpine\' ; cf. the Inferno, XII. 3. A Celtic word ; \rcf. Gaelic alp, \'a high mountain.\' \r\ramarant, in. 352; Gk. d/xd/javros, \'unfading\' the word used in \ri Peter v. 4 of the "crown of glory that fadeth not away." The flower \rtypifies immortality. M. writes the correct form ; the more usual \r\' amaranth \' is due to confusion with Gk. &vQos, \' a flower.\' \r\ramain; an intensive word, emphasising the sense of the verb. \rO. E. magn = \' power \'; from the root whence ^705, magnus. \r\rambrosial ; used by M. of that which delights the sense of smell \r(in. 135, IX. 852) or taste. Strictly, auppoaia., from a;*/9p<50-ios ( a \rlengthened form of d^t/Sporos, \' immortal\'), meant the food of the gods. \r\ramerce, I. 609, literally \'to punish\'; cf. Romeo and Juliet, in. i. \r195, "But I\'ll amerce you with so strong ay?*." Fr. amercier, \' to fine,\' \rwhich was derived from the O. Fr. phrase estre a merci ^Q be in the \rmercy of any one as to the amount of a fine (Lat. merx) which he \rcould impose.\' Legally an Amerciament differed from a fine thus : \r"Fines... are punishments certain, which grow expressly from some \rStatute; and Amerciaments are arbitrarily imposed by Assessors" \r(Blount, Glossographia, 1656). Fr. merci, whence E. mercy, is connected \rwith merx ( = \' a fine \' in Late Latin), and not with misericordia. \r\ramiable, iv. 250, vni. 484, ix. 899, \'lovely, pleasing\'; cf. Psalm \rIxxxiv. i, "How amiable are thy dwellings" (Prayer- Book}. Lat. \ramicabilis, \'friendly.\' \r\rammiral, i. 294. The chief vessel of a fleet was called the \'admiral \' \r\r\r\r696 PARADISE LOST. \r\rbecause it carried the admiral or chief officer. Cf. Hakluyt, I. 401, " the \r\rsayd William met with sixe ships and tooke of them the Admirall." \r\rThe word was indeed quite common in the i6th century works of \rtravel; cf. Webb\'s Travels, 1590: "her Maijesties shippe called the \rWilloughby was our Admirall, and the Harry appertayning to the \rcompany of the Merchants, was our Vice-admirall, Maister William \rBurrow then being our Captaine and maister" (Arber\'s ed., p. 19). \rIn the form ammiral M. imitates Ital. ammiraglia, which Florio (1598) \rrenders by "an admirall or chief ship." Properly admiral means \r\'ruler, commander,\' being derived from Arabic Amir, \'ruler\' (cf. \rAmeer of Afghanistan and Emir) ; and formerly the full phrase \r" admiral of the sea " was used. The d in admiral (older form amyrel) \rarose through confusion with Lat. admirabilis and admirable. \r\ramphisbsena, X. 524 ; Gk. dfjufilffpcui\'a, \' a kind of serpent that can \rgo either forwards or backwards \' (Gk. a.fji.^1, \' on both sides \' +ftaiveiv, \r\'to go \'). See the Agamemnon 1733. It was supposed to have a head \rat either end of its body: hence the allusion in Tennyson\'s Queen \rMary, HI. 4 : \r\r" For heretic and traitor are all one ; \rTwo vipers of one breed an amphisbsena, \rEach end a sting." \rDante has the word in the Serpent-passage in the Inferno, xxiv. 87. \r\rannoy ; derived through O. Fr. anoi, \' vexation,\' from Lat. in odio, \rused in the phrase in odio est mihi, \'it is odious, to me.\' In VI. 369 \rit has the old Shakespearian sense \'to hurt, harm.\' Cognate with \r\' noisome \'= \'unpleasant,\' especially of smell, which practically is short \rfor \' anoisome \' ; cf. IX. 946. \r\rapparent, IV. 608, x. 1 12 = \' visible, manifest \' (Lat. apparent) ; as in \rP. A". II. 397. Cf. Richard III. in. 5. 30, "apparent open guilt," \rand King John, iv. 2. 93, "apparent foul play." \r\rapply* IV. 264 ; commonly explained \' to practise, engage in \' (cf. the \rabbreviated form ply) ; for this use, formerly not uncommon, cf. Fuller\'s \rWorthies, " That he might the more effectually apply his private devo- \rtions," Works (ed. 1840), HI. 402. I believe, however, that the sense \rintended by M. is \'add,\' and that the word was so interpreted by \rCollins and Thomson. Cf. The Passions, 49, 50 : \r"Dejected Pity at his side \r\rHer soul-subduing voice applied"; \rand The Seasons (Spring) : \r\r"the woodlands round \rApplied their quire." \r\'To add\' may come from the general sense of apply- \'to bring to \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 697 \r\rbear upon \' ; or M. may simply have imitated the rare use of Latin \rapplicare = * to add.\' \r\rapprove, ix. 367, 1140, \'to show\' by bringing a thing to the test \r(Lat. ad, \'to\'+proba, \'a test\'). Cf. 2 Corinthians vii. u, "In all \rthings ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter." \r\rareed, or aread, iv. 962, \'to advise\'; A.S. d-rSdan = a-, intensive \rprefix, -\\-rddan , \'to advise.\' Cf. rede (or read], \'counsel,\' as in Hamlet, \r* 3- 5 J > "recks not his own rede." But the commoner meanings of \rareed were \' to divine, conjecture \' (cf. the cognate Germ, errathen, \r\'to guess\'); and \'to declare, tell,\' as often in Spenser; cf. The Faerie \rQueene, I. 9. iS, II. 3. 14. \r\rasphodel, ix. 1040 ; Gk. d<r0<53e\\os, a kind of lily, supposed to \rflourish especially in the Elysian fields ; cf. Comus, 838. Daffodil is a \rcurious corruption of cur#63eXoj through Low Lat. affodilhis. \r\rassay, I. 619, in. 90, x. 567, 865, \'to try, attempt\'; M. always \ruses this form, from O. Fr. assai, a variant of O. Fr. essai, whence \rcomes our commoner form essay. Lat. exagium^ Gk. et-dyiov, \'a \rweighing, trial of weight.\' Now assay is commonly used of the testing \rof metals. \r\rastonish, I. 266, vi. 838 ; formed from the older verb astony-O. Fr. \restonner, modern Fr. ttonner, from Lat. extonare, \'to thunder.\' The \roriginal notion of astony (see ix. 890), astonish, and astound (i. 281) \rwas \' to stupefy, strike senseless, as with a thunderbolt.\' Cf. the \rArgument to bk. I., line 12, and Milton\'s History of Britain, \r"astonished and struck with superstition as with a planet." See The \rFaerie Queene, iv. 8. 43. \r\ray me, I v. 86, \' alas \' ; cf. Lycidas, 56, \' \' Ay me ! I fondly dream ! " \rIt is frequent in Shakespeare. Cotgrave (1611) has, "Oh: aye me; \ran interjection expressing sense of paine, or of smart." O. Fr. aymi, \r\'alas, for me\' ; cf. Ital. ahimt, Gk. of/tot. \r\rbaleful, I. 56, u. 576, \'full of sorrow, unhappy\'; commonly \r\'full of harm\' cf. Comus, 255, "baleful drugs." A.S. */ = \'evil, \rsorrow.\' \r\rtoarricado, vin. 241 , \' to fortify.\' The noun barricade is from Spanish \rbarricada, literally \'a rampart formed by barrels\' (Span. barrica = \r\' barrel \'), and so \' any rampart, fortification.\' Cf. AWs Well that Ends \rWell, I. i. 124; and Milton\'s treatise Of Reformation in England, I. : \r"the table of communion, now become a table of separation, stands \rlike an exalted platform upon the brow of the quire, fortified with \rbulwark and barricade, to keep off the profane touch of the laics" \r(P. W. u. 378). \r\rbases, ix. 36. Cf. The Faerie Quecne, v. 5. 20 : \r\r\r\r698 PARADISE LOST. \r\r"she made him to be dight \rIn womans weedes, that is to manhood shame, \rAnd put before his lap a napron white, \rInstead of Curiets [i.e. cuirasses] and bases fit for fight." \rPeele in his Polyhymnia, 1590 (a description of a tournament), speaks \rof a knight clad " In armour gilt and bases full of cost." \r\rbeest, i. 84. The verb be, from A.S. beon (the infinitive), was \rconjugated in the pres. tense indicative as late as Milton\'s time, \respecially in the 2nd pers. sing, with if. M. indeed does not use " if \rthou beest " elsewhere, but the idiom is frequent in Shakespeare ; \rcf. The Tempest, m. 2. 137, "if thou beest a man," and v. 134, "if \rthou be\'st Prosper o." \r\rBehemoth, vn. 471. " This word is the Heb. plural of behtmah, and \rsignifies \'beasts,\' but in Job xl. 15 24 some large animal, e.g. the \rhippopotamus, is evidently intended" (Cambridge Companion to the \rBible). M. meant the elephant. \r\rbicker, vi. 766; used of gleaming, darting light. Cf. Tennyson, \rGeraint and Enid : \r\r"turning round she saw \rDust and the points of lances bicker in it"; \r\rand The Princess, v. The word is also used of rippling water or a quick- \rflowing brook, as in the first stanza of Tennyson\'s The Brook. Thomson \rin The Castle of Indolence, I. 3, speaks of glittering streamlets that \r"bickered through the sunny glade." \r\rblanc, x. 656, \' pale,\' from the literal sense \'white,\' Fr. blanc. For \rthe form blanc (i.e. blank), obsolete as an adjective, cf. the noun blanc, \r\' white paint.\' \r\rbland, v. 5 ; used poetically of that which is "soft, mild, pleasing \rto the senses ; gentle, genial, balmy, soothing." \r\rblow, v. 22, \'to bloom, flower\'; cf. Lycidas, 48, "When first the \rwhite-thorn blows." Minsheu has, "To blow as a flower, or to open \ras a \\mA...bluhen, fleurir" Blow, bloom, blossom are cognate, and \rakin to Lat. flos and its derivatives, flower, flourish, etc. \r\rboon, iv. 242, \'gracious, bounteous\'; a poetical use. Cf. Thomson, \rLiberty, II., "All that boon Nature could luxuriant pour" ; and The Castle \rof Indolence, I. 57: \r\r"Of the fine stores he nothing would impart, \r\rWhich or boon Nature gave, or nature-painting art." \rSo in Collins\'s Ode The Manners (ehd) : \r\r"O Nature boon, from whom proceed \r\rEach forceful thought, each prompted deed." \rNow only in the phrase " boon companion." Fr. ban (Lat. bonus). \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 699 \r\rbrinded, vu. 466, \'striped, streaked\'; cf. Comus, 443, "thebrinded \rlioness." An older form than brindled, it means literally \'marked as \rwith a brand,\' and generally indicates stripes of dark colour on the \rtawny coat of an animal. See Macbeth, iv. i. I, "Thrice the brinded \rcat hath mew\'d." \r\rbrown, ix. 1088, \'dark\'; in poetry a constant epithet of shade and \rtwilight. Cf. // Penseroso, 134, "shadows brown"; P. R. n. 293, \r"alleys brown," i.e. shady paths; and imbrown in iv. 246. Imitated \rfrom the similar use of bruno and imbrnnire by Italian poets. Thus in \rhis 2nd Ital. Sonnet M. has " al imbrunir di sera," with which editors \rcompare Petrarch, Canzoni, iv. 3, and Tasso, Gerusalemme Liberata, \rv. 76. So in the Inferno, n. i, where Vaer bruno refers to twilight. \r\rbull, in. 492; a papal edict, of an important character: "so \rnamed from the bulla (or round leaden seal), which is attached to the \rdocument... and gives authenticity to it" (Addis and Arnold, Catholic \rDiet.}. \r\rbullion, i. 704; Fr. bouillon, Lat. bullio, * a mass of metal,\' from \rbullire, * to boil.\' Bullion is connected with Lat. bulla, \' a seal,\' in \rso far as bulla itself is from bullire. \r\rbuxom, n. 842, V. 270, \'yielding\'; from A.S. btigan, \'to bend\'; \rcf. Germ, beugsam, \' easily bent, pliant.\' Originally buxom meant \r\'obedient\'; cf. the Glosse to Spenser\'s The Shepheards Calender, \rSeptember, " Bitxome and bent, meeke and obedient." Then came \rthe sense \'yielding, pliant\'; cf. Fairfax, Tasso, XV. 12, "with strong \roars... brush the buxom wave." \r\rCan, xi. 388. Kaan, or Khan, was the title of the supreme ruler of \rChina during the reigns of the Mongol Emperors descended from Ching- \rhiz, or Genghis, Khan (the name corrupted into Cambuscan see note \ron // Pen. no). In Elizabethan writers Kaan often appears as Cham; \rcf. Much Ado About Nothing, II. i. 274 77, "will... fetch you a hair \roff the great Cham\'s beard." Frequently the Cham is spoken of as \rthe ruler of the district of Central Asia vaguely called Tartary. Cf. \rGiles Fletcher\'s Of the Russe Common Wealth, 1591, "The greatest \rand mightiest of them (the Tartars) is the Chrim Tartar (whom some \rcall the Great Cham] that lieth South, and Southeastward from Russia." \rHexham\'s edition, too, of Mercator^s Atlas (1636) describes Tartary as \r"the Empire of the Grand Cham." Very little was then known about \rCentral Asia. \r\rcaravan, vn. 428. Properly (i) a company of merchants or pil- \rgrims travelling together, as a protection against robbers, in the East. \rHence (2) any \' company, troop \' ; as here and in P. R. i. 323. Then \r(3) \'a covered waggon\'; cf. the abbreviation van. Persian karwan, \r\' escort.\' \r\r\r\r700 PARADISE LOST. \r\rcareer, I. 766; a word specially associated with tournaments, \rsignifying \'a short gallop at high speed.\' Cf. the Animadversions, \r"all this careering with spear in rest" (P. W. III. 90). Fr. cariere, \rLat. carraria (i.e. via), \'a road for carriages.\' \r\rcausey, x. 415, \'a raised way\'; now obsolete except in dialects. \rCf., however, Proverbs xv. 19, "the way of the righteous is made \rplain," where the margin has "raised up as a causey." In i Chronicles \rxxvi. 16 the Bible of 1611 had "by the causey of the going up," \rafterwards changed to causeway ; the latter is a compound of the \rold world causey + way. A causey implies a paved road, such as \ra paved track across a moor or boggy land, or the Roman paved \rroads in Northumberland ; hence sometimes used colloquially of the \rpavement or side- walk contrasted with the road proper. From Late \rLat. calciata (i.e. calciata via), literally \' a way made firm by treading \rwith the heel\' (calx). \r\rchampain, iv. 134, \'open, flat\'; applied to unenclosed land, downs, \rlarge fields ; cf. Lucrece, 1247, *\' a goodly champaign plain." Minsheu\'s \rDictionary entitled The Guide into the Tongues (1625) has: "champion, \ror plaine ground." The Dialect Diet, aptly quotes the title of Tusser\'s \rHusbandry ( 1 580) : " Five hundred pointes of good Husbandrie, as well \rfor the Champion, or open countrie, as also for the woodland." Com- \rmonly a noun (vi. 2); cf. Deut. xi. 30, "the Canaanites, which dwell \rin the champaign over against Gilgal." O. Fr. champaigne, modern Fr. \rcampagne, Ital. campagna, Lat. campania from campus. \r\rcharity, in. 216, iv. 756, xn. 584; then often used = Move, \rbenevolence. 1 Cf. i Cor. xiii., where the Revised Version of the \rBible substitutes love for charity throughout, the Greek being dydirrj \r(Vulgate caritas). In the three places where M. uses the word the \rmeaning is \'love.\' Cf. Wordsworth, The Excursion, ix. 238, "The \rcharities that soothe, and heal, and bless"; and Tennyson, The \rPrincess, vil., "fair charities." Lat. carus, \'dear.\' \r\rcharm, iv. 642, 65 1, \' song.\' M. may have supposed it to be derived \rfrom Lat. carmen, \' song,\' but really charm as used of the song of birds is \rof Anglo-Saxon origin. It is a variant form of Middle E. cherme or chirm \r= A.S. firm. This old word (allied to chirp and the Germ, jammern) \rmeant a blended singing or noise of many children, birds or bees; cf. \rPalsgrave (1530), "what a cherme these byrdes [birds] make, comme ces \royseaux jargonnent." A Shropshire rustic might still say, "what charm \rthem childern bin makin i\' the school" (i.e. what a confused noise). Cf. \ralso the dialect-expression \'to charm or cherm bees,\' i.e. to follow a \rswarm of bees, beating a tea-tray, or anything similar, to make them \rsettle. The noisy chatter of a flock of starlings is exactly a charm or \rcherm. Tennyson uses charm accurately ; cf. The Progress of Spring, \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 701 \r\rIV., "I hear a charm of song thro\' all the land." Probably cherme or \rchirm would never have got this variant form charm but for the in- \rfluence of Lat. carmen. \r\rCherubim; the correct form = Heb. Kherubhim, the plural of \rKhtrubh ; adopted in the Revised Version of the Bible. The oldest \rforms in English, as still in French, were Cherubin, sing., and Ghent- \rbins, plural. Cf. Coverdale, "Thou God of Israel, which dwellest upon \rCherubin," Isaiah xxxvii. 16 ; and Wyclif, "Two Goldun Cherubyns," \rExodus xxv. 18. Later, as in the Bible of 1611, Cherub, sing., and \rCherubims, plural, were used, as being closer to the Hebrew. M. wrote \rCherube for singular (a still nearer approach in sound than \' Cherub \' to \rthe u of the Heb. Kheriibh}, and the true plural Chenibim in his \rpoetry; but Cherubims occurs in Of Reformation in England, II. \r(P. W. n. 406). Kherubh is said to come from the Babylonian word \rfor the figure of the winged bull which stood at the door of a house to \rkeep off evil spirits. The Jews probably owed it to the Phoenicians. \r\rcombustion, I. 46; properly \'conflagration,\' from Lat. comburere, \rto burn up\'; cf. Selden\'s Table-Talk\'. "After Luther had made a \rcombustion in Germany about religion" (Reynold\'s ed., p. 34). Hence \rmetaphorically \'utter confusion,\' or \'destruction,\' as here. Cf. vi. -225, \rand Macbeth, n. 3. 63. In M. always a very strong word ; cf. Of Refor- \rmation in England, n., " to threaten uproar and combustion, and shake \rthe brand of civil discord," P. W. n. 417. \r\rconcoct, v. 412 ; Lat. concoquere, \'to boil together, reduce by heat\' : \respecially, \'to reduce into a state of nourishment,\' i.e. digest. Cf. M. \rin On Education, " The like also would not be inexpedient after meat, \rto assist and cherish nature in her first concoction," P. W. in. 476. \r\rconjured, n. 693, \'banded (literally \'sworn\') together in a con- \rspiracy \' ; Lat. conjuratus. Cf. Surrey\'s translation (1557) of sEneid n., \r"They bind themselves with the conjured bands," and The Faerie \rQueene, v. 10. 26. \r\rconnive, x. 624; Lat. connivere, \'to close the eyes, wink,\' hence \rfiguratively \' to shut one\'s eyes to a fault.\' Now it always has the bad \rsense of \'winking at something wrong \'; but in Elizabethan E. it also had \rthe good sense \' to tolerate, be long-suffering.\' Cf. S. A. 465 67: \r\r" He [the Almighty] \r\rWill not connive, or linger, thus provoked, \rBut will arise and his great name assert." \r\rIn Of Reformation in England, II., M. praises "the constancy of our \rnobility and commons of England,... whose calm and temperate con- \rnivance could sit still and smile out the stormy bluster,..," P. IV. \rII. 406. \r\r\r\r702 PARADISE LOST. \r\rcouch, ii. 536, \'to fix the spear in the rest\' (Fr. coucher). The \r\' rest \' was " a strong part of the armour at the breast, against which they \rplaced the butt of the spear to give more force to the charge" (Keight- \rley). Cf. i Henry VL ill. 2. 134, 1< A braver soldier never couched \rlance." \r\rcresset, 1.728; a vessel of iron to hold some burning substance \r(e.g. grease, oil, tarred rope) and serve as a lantern or beacon ; usually \rmounted on the top of a pole, or hung from a roof; cf. Scott, Mann ion, \r" A cresset in an iron chain." It was an archaic word even in Milton\'s \rtime; cf. Minsheu (1625) : "a Cresset, an old word used for a Lanterne, \ror burning Beacon." Cotgrave\'s Dictionary (ed. 1652) adds a curious \rlittle detail: "Falot. A Cresset light (such as they use in Play-houses)." \rFr. cresset or crasset, \'a cup for holding grease.\' \r\rcry, II. 654, \'a pack\'; cf. Coriolanus, in. 3. 120, "You common \rcry of curs ! " The sense comes from the hounds\' cry or notes. \r\rdamasked, iv. 334. The noun damask meant properly a rich kind \rof silk ornamented with raised figures, originally manufactured at \rDamascus. By metaphor, the word came to imply \' variegation \' as \rhere.- Cf. As You Like It, III. 5. 123, and Shakespeare, Sonnet 130, \r" I have seen roses damask\'d, red and white." \r\rdarkling, in. 39, \' in the dark \' ; cf. A Midsummer- Nigh? s Dream, \rII. 2. 86, "O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so," and King Lear, \r\\. 4. 237. It is a substantival adverb, in which -ling or -long is a relic of \ra dative case-ending; cf. headlong, sidelong (Middle E. hedling, sideling). \rIn Scotch the form is lins; cf. hafflins*\\ia\\i,\' e.g. in Burns, Cotter\'s \rSaturday Night, 62, "While Jenny hafflins is afraid to speak." \r\rdecent, in. 644, \'comely\' ; used by M. only here and in // Penseroso, \r36, in each place = Lat. decent, \'comely, graceful.\' Cf. Pope, Elegy to \rthe Memory of an Unfortunate Lady, 51, 52 : \r\r" By foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed, \r\rBy foreign hands thy decent limbs composed." \rCf. decencies^ graceful acts or words\' in vin. 601. \r\rdescant, iv. 603 ; strictly, a musical term for variations added to a \r"plain song," i.e. a melody in its simplest form. Cf. Jeremy Taylor, \r"after the angel had told his message in plain song, the whole chorus \rjoined in descant." M., whose use of musical terms is very accurate, \remploys descant here to signify the varied notes of the nightingale. Cf. \rIsaac Walton\'s description " the clear airs, the sweet descants, the \rnatural rising and falling, the doubling and redoubling of her voice" \r(i.e. the nightingale\'s), Complete Angler, I. i. So Spenser says of \rthe thrush, "the Mavis descant playes," Epithalamium, 81. Contrast \r"the plain-song cuckoo" in A Midsummer- Night\'s Dream, in. i. 134, \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 703 \r\rsaid in allusion to the bird\'s simple, monotonous note. In S. A. 1228 \rdescant has a figurative sense. \r\rdetermine. The senses \'to put an end to, bring to an end,\' and \r\' to come to an end, cease to exist to be in force, \' are common in \rElizabethan writers, but now chiefly confined to legal documents. \rCf. 2 Henry IV. iv. 5. 82, Coriolanus, ill. 3. 43. The idea of \'end\' \r(Lat. terminus) is conspicuous in n. 330, vi. 318, xi. 227. \r\rdint, n. 813, \'a blow,\' its original sense; also used of the dent \r(another form of dint) or impression left by a blow ; cf. Shakespeare, \rAntony and Cleopatra, n. 6. 39, "targes undinted," i.e. shields not \rmarked by blows. Dint is still a north -country word for \'a blow, \rshock.\' \r\rdisastrous, i. 597, \' boding misfortune.\' Disaster (Lat. dis + astrutn, \r\'a star\') is one of the words belonging to astrology. Cf. Minsheu : \r" disastre, misfortune... proprie incommodum aliquod ex influentijs \rA stroru m" Cf . \' i 11 - s t ar red . \' \r\rdivan, x. 457, \'a council, \'properly the council of the Sultan or some \rOriental sovereign or governor ; Arabic dlwdn, \' a council, tribunal.\' \rFr. douane, \' a custom-house, \' comes from diwdn. \r\rdole, iv. 894, \'sorrow, pain \' ; O. Fr. doel, Fr. deuil Late Lat. dolium, \rfrom the stem of dolere, \'to grieve.\' Cf. Hamlet, I. 2. 13, "In equal \rscale weighing delight and dole.\'\'\'\' \r\rdraff, x. 630, \' refuse food,\' especially food given to swine. Cf. \rCotgrave\'s French Dictionary (1611), " Mangeaille pour les porceaux : \rSwillings, washings, draffe." Samson was given " the draff of servile \rfood," S. A. 574. Used figuratively; cf. Milton\'s Doctrine and Dis- \rcipline of Divorce, "the brood of Belial, the draff of men," P. W. \rin. 173. \'As bad as draff \' = \' utterly worthless\' is a common \rYorkshire phrase. Cognate with drab, \' an untidy woman.\' \r\relement, 11. 490, \'sky,\' a common Elizabethan use; cf. Henry V. \rIV. i. 105, 107, " the king is but a man, as I am : the element shows to \rhim as it doth to me." So in King Lear, III. i. 4. \r\relixir, in. 607 = Arabic el iksir, the philosopher\'s stone; see note \ron in. 601, and cf. Chaucer, Canterbury Tales, 16331 : "the philosophers \rston j Elixir cleped." That was the strict sense of elixir; but it was \ralso variously used by alchemists of (i) a liquid by which metals might \rbe transmuted into gold, (2) a tincture of gold (auruni polabile}, which \rwould prolong life ; hence (3) a life-giving cordial, or substance, or \rforce. Arabic el iksir is really a Greek word (ir)pov or ^piov), and \rmeans \'the dry-principle.\' \r\remblem, iv. 703, \' inlaid or mosaic work,\' i.e. ornamentation inserted \rinto the surface of an object, e.g. a floor (as here) or a table. Gk. fy- \r\r\r\r704 PARADISE LOST. \r\rp\\rj}j.a, \'a thing put in, an ornament.\' Now commonly= \'an allegorical \rrepresentation of, a symbol.\' \r\rempyreal; literally \'fiery, formed of fire,\' i. 117, n. 430. But \rM. uses it generally in the sense \'heavenly,\' i.e. as the adj. from \rempyrean = \' heaven.\' Lat. empyraus, Gk. fyiTrfyatos, \' in the fire (irvp), \rfiery hot, burning.\' M. always accents the adj. empyreal \', but the \rnoun empyrtan (n. 771). \r\rengine, I. 750; in its original sense \'contrivance,\' i.e. something \rmade with ingenuity (Lat. ingenium). Later, \' an implement, instru- \rment,\' especially of war; so in II. 923, where it may mean \'cannon,\' \ras in vi. 484, 518. Cf. Othello, in. 3. 355, "you mortal engines" \r(i.e. cannon). \r\renormous, I. 511, v. 297, \'monstrous, out of all measure,\' rule the \rliteral sense of Lat. enormis. Cf. Of Reformation in England, I., \r"misshapen and enormous prelatism," P. IV. II. 373. Blount, Glosso- \rgraphia, has, "Enormity, want of measure, or rule, unevenness, \rhugeness." \r\ressence ; properly \' being, existence \' (Lat. essentia, from esse ; cf. \rGk. oviria) ; hence \' something that is an existence, entity especially \rsomething spiritual, a heavenly, immaterial being, 1 like the angels \r(i. 138). Cf. Sir Thomas Browne, "those noble essences in heaven \rbear a friendly regard unto their fellow-natures on earth " (Religio \rMedici, I. xxxi.). In the singular M. always uses essence to mean \r\'constituent substance\' (i. 425, II. 215, IX. 166). \r\rexercise, n. 89 ; in the sense of Lat. exercere, *to harass, torment\'; \rcf. Vergil, sEneid V. 725, nale. ..Iliads exercite fatis. So in Ecdesiastes i. \r13, "this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised \rthere with" =" to afflict them" as the margin reads. See P. R. I. 156. \r\rexorbitant, in. 177; strictly, \'going out of its circuit or track* \r(Lat. orbita} ; e.g. like a star leaving its orbit. Cf. M. in The Reason \rof Church Government , 11. 3, "the proper sphere wherein the magistrate \rcannot but confine his motion without a hideous exorbitancy from law," \r/*. IV. H. 497. Here the general notion \' excessive,\' e.g. of price, \rdemands. Minsheu has : " exorbitant, things properly out of circle, \rsquare or rule, things irregular, enormieus." \r\rexplode, x. 546, XL 669; used = Lat. explodere, \'to drive off the \rstage,\' i.e. by clapping (ex, \' off, away \' +plaudere, \' to clap \'). So in the \rAnimadversions upon the Remonstrant\'s Defence, "ceremonies, liturgies \rand tyrannies, which God and man are now ready to explode and hiss \rout of the land," P. W. in. 43. Blount\'s Glossographia has, "explode, \rpublickly to disgrace, or drive out by hissing, or clapping of hands." \r\rfame, i. 651, n. 346; for the literal sense \'rumour, report\' ( = Lat. \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 7O5 \r\rfama}, cf. Bacon, Of Seditions : "as if fames were the reliques of \rseditions past," and again: "seditious tumults and seditious fames \rdiffer no more but as brother and sister, masculine and feminine" \r(Pitt Tress ed., p. 39). \r\rfare, n. 940, iv. 131, \'to journey, travel\'; the literal sense of A.S. \rfaran ; cf. Germ, fahren, \' to travel.\' So often in Spenser ; cf. The \rFaerie Queene, II. i. 2, n. 2. 12. \r\rflaw, x. 698, \'a gust of wind\'; a poetic word. Cf. Hamlet \', v. i. \r239, " the winter\'s flaw "; and Tennyson, Marriage of Geraint, " Like \rflaws in summer laying lusty corn." In Scotland it is used of a storm \rof snow, in Norfolk of a sharp shower. The same 2^ flaw, \' a crack \' = \rSwedish flaga, \'a crack,\' also \'a blast of wind\'; the radical notion being \r\' a sudden burst.\' \r\rfledge, vu. 420 ; cf. in. 627. Minsheu has, "fledge, or feathered." \rCf. Holland\'s Pliny (1601), X. 9, "The young cuckoo being once fledge \rand readie to flie abroad." This adj. fledge (whence fledge-ling} is \rreally older than the p. p. Jledged which we use. Akin iojlee, fly, flight. \r\rfoil, x. 375, \'a defeat \' ; cf. the Paraphrase on Psalm cxiv. made by \rM. in his boyhood, "As a faint host that hath received the foil." O. Fr. \rfouler, \' to trample under foot \' ; cf. foule, \' a crowd.\' The original \rnotion is seen in The Faerie Queene, v. 1 1. 33 : \r\r"Whom he did all to peeces breake, and foyle \rIn filthy durt, and left so in the loathely soyle." \r\rfond, in. 449, VIII. 195, 209, \' foolish\' ; its old meaning. Cf. King \rLear, iv. 7. 60, " I am a very foolish fond old man." Hence fondly = \r\'foolishly,\' in. 470, vu. 152; cf. Lycidas, 56, "Ay me! I fondly \rdream." It is still quite common as a dialect-word equivalent to \'daft,\' \respecially in north-country phrases like \'as fond as a besom\' (or \' gate\'). \rOriginally fond was the p. p. of a Middle E. verb fonnen, \'to act like a \rfool,\' from the noun/0, * a fool.\' The root is Scandinavian. \r\rfounder, i. 204, n. 940; properly \'to sink to the bottom\' (Lat. \rfundus, FT. fond, \'bottom\'); cf. night-foundered \\ I. 204, Comus, 483. \r\rframe, n. 924, \' fabric \' ; a favourite word with M. and with writers \rlike Dryden and Thomson who were influenced by his diction (see n. \r898, v. 154, notes). Similar is the Lucretian phrase moles et machina \rmundi (v. 96) ; cf. Spenser, An Hymne of Heavenly Love, 22, " this \rworlds great frame," and his Hymne of Heavenly Beautie, 30, 31. \r\rfrequent, i. 797, vu. 504 ; in the sense of Lat. frequens, \'crowded.\' \rCf. Ben Jonson, Se/anus, " \'Tis Caesar\'s will to have a frequent senate." \rM. twice uses "in full frequence " = \' in full assembly\' (Lat. frequentia) ; \rcf. P. R. i. 128, u. 130. Cf. Tennyson, The Princess, IV., "Not in this \rfrequence can I lend full tongue." \r\rP. L, 45 \r\r\r\r706 PARADISE LOST. \r\rfretted, I. 717 ; from the verb fret=\'to work or design with /rets.* \rA fret was a small band; the word comes from O. Fr. frete, \'an iron \rband \' = Ital. ferrata, \'an iron grating\' (cf. Lat. ferrum, \'iron\'). \r"Fret-work" was specially used of a kind of gilding for the roofs of \rhalls ; being a pattern formed by small gilt bands or frets intersecting \reach other at right angles. Cf. Bacon, Advancement of Learning, 11. \r14. 9, "beautiful works and orders, like the/rets in the roofs of houses" ; \rwhere Mr Aldis Wright says, "the Egyptian key pattern is a familiar \rexample." So Milton uses the word here, and Shakespeare in Hamlet \', \rII. 2.313, " this majestical roof fretted with golden fire." Quite distinct \ris the other verb, fret, \' to adorn,\' from A.S.fratzuan. \r\rfrore, II. 595, \'frosty\'; from A.S. froren, \'frozen,\' the p. p. of \rfreosan, \'to freeze.\' Spenser has the adj. frory, \'frozen,\' in The \rFaerie Queene, ill. 8. 35, and frorne, \'frozen,\' in The Shepheards \rCalender, February. \r\rgalaxy, vn. 579 ; Gk. ya\\aias (i.e. /ciJ/cXos), \'Milky Way\' (literally \r\' circle \') ; from yd\\a, \' milk.\' Cf. Tennyson, The Lady of Shalott : \r" Like to some branch of stars we see \rHung in the golden Galaxy." \r\rglozing, in. 93, \'flattering.\' Middle E. glosen meant \'to make \rglosses, explain,\' from O.Fr. -/<w = Late Lat. glossa, Gk. 7\\w<r<ra, which \rsignified \' the tongue, a language, a word, a word needing explanation, \ran explanation.\' But since many explanations are false, the verb glosen \rgot the idea \'to interpret falsely,\' whence \'to deceive.\' So glozing \r\'deceptive\' ; cf. George Herbert, The Dotage, " False glozing pleasures." \rEspecially used of flattering, false speech (ix. 549); cf. Comus, 161, \r"And well-placed words of glozing courtesy." \r\rgoblin, II. 688. Derived through the French from Late Lat. \rgobelinus, a diminutive of Lat. fobalus, \'a mountain-sprite, demon\' = Gk. \rK6/3aXo$, \' a rogue,\' or \'a goblin supposed to befriend rogues.\' \r\rgonfalon, v. 589, a " banner, or square standard born on the top of \ra launce" (Cotgrave, 1611). The earlier form was gonfanon\\ cf. The \rRomaunt of the Rose, " I bare of loue the gonfenoun." O. Fr. gonfanon \rMiddle High Germ, gundfano, \'battle-flag.\' \r\rGordian, iv. 348 = Lat. Gordius, \'pertaining to Gordius\' (Gk. \rr6p8tos). According to the legend, Gordius, the first king of Phrygia, \rtied an inextricable knot, the undoer of which was promised by an \roracle the sovereignty of Asia. Alexander the Great cut the knot \rwith his sword and fulfilled the oracle by conquering Asia. Cf. the old \rplay Lingua (1607) : \r\r"The Gordian knot which Alexander Great \rDid whilom cut with his all-conquering sword." \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. .707 \r\rHence Gordian =\' inextricable.\' Cf. George Herbert, Dimnitie, " Who \rcan these Gordian knots untie ? " \r\rgrain, v. 285, xi. 242 ; derived from O. Fr. graine, Lat. granum, \rthe Low Latin equivalent for the classical word coccum. Properly \rcoccum meant a \'berry\'; but it was specially used of the cochineal \rinsect found upon the scarlet oak in Spain and other Mediterranean \rcountries; this insect being, from its shape, supposed to be a berry. \rFrom the cochineal insect a certain dye was made, called coccum ; \rwhence coccinus \' red.\' In Low Latin granum took the place of \rcoccum. Strictly, therefore, grain signified a scarlet dye such as could \rbe extracted from this cochineal insect. Cf. Cotgrave : " Graine : the \rseed of herbs, also grain wherewith cloth is dyed in grain, scarlet die." \rBut Cotgrave also has " Migraine : Scarlet, or Purple in graine," and \rit seems as though the word had lost something of its original sense, \rand could be applied to shades of blue or purple. Cf. Lycidas, 142 \r(the first draft of the lines). \r\rgrunsel, I. 460 = ground-sill. Minsheu (1625) has, "a Groundsell of \ra doore ; vide Threshold," and the old Latin Dictionary called Manipulus \rVocabulorum (1570) has, "A grunsen hypotheron" (Early English Text \rSociety\'s ed., p. 164). The second part of the word, sill, is akin to Germ. \rschwelle, \' threshold. \' \r\rgryphon, n. 943 ; Lat. gryphus, from Gk. ypfy ; also in Late Lat. \rgriffus, whence the other form griffin. A third form in Elizabethan E. \rwas gripe ; cf. Shakespeare, Lucrece, 543. \r\rharald, i. 752, u. 518, ( herald\'; always spelt haraldo.t. Ital. \raraldo in the original editions of Paradise Lost. It illustrates Milton\'s \rliking for Italian forms. \r\rharbinger, ix. 13, xi. 589, \'a forerunner \' ; in P. R. i. 71, 277, John \rthe Baptist is called the " harbinger " of Christ. Originally it meant an \rofficer who went in advance of an army or prince to make provision \rfor the night\'s shelter. Cf. Florio\'s Dictionary (1598), "Foriere, a \rharbinger for a camp or a prince," and Bullokar\'s Expositor (1616): \r" Harbinger, one that taketh up lodging for others." From Icelandic \rherbergi, \' an army shelter \' ; cf. the cognate German words heer, \r\' army \' + bergen, \' to shelter. \' \r\rheinous, ix. 929, x. r ; spelt hainous in the original editions, as \roften in old writers. Fr. haineux, \'hateful.\' \r\rhighth, i. 24, II. 95 ; always written thus by M. The form is \rcommon in Hakluyt\'s Voyages, and is said to survive in parts of \rAmerica. High-th is curious in that it retains the th of the A.S. word \rheh\\u, represented now by t cf. heigh-t. \r\rhosanna, in. 348, vi. 205, \' save, I pray\' (or \'we pray\') ; na being a \r\r452 \r\r\r\r70S PARADISE LOST. \r\rparticle expressing entreaty, while the first part of the word is from the \rstem \'to save,\' whence the name Jesus = \'Saviour,\' and Joshua. Com- \rmonly hosanna is a cry for deliverance ; but sometimes of praise, as \rin Malt. xxi. 9, "Hosanna to the son of David... Hosanna in the \rhighest." From the use of hosanna in that passage Palm-Sunday was \rcalled \'Hosanna-Sunday\' in the mediaeval Western Church. \r\rhosting, vi. 93, \'an encounter.\' The more usual sense was \'the \rraising or assembling of an army or host \' ; especially in the feudal \rphrase \'hosting and hunting.\' \r\rhubbub, n. 951, xn. 60, \'confused din\'; put for hoop-hoop, a \rreduplication of hoop, \' a cry of surprise \' cf. O. Fr. houper, \' to shout.\' \rAlso written ivhoobnb, as in The Winters Tale, IV. 4. 628. Cf. \r\'^>/ing (or \' hooping \')-cough.\' \r\rhyaline, vn. 619, \'the glassy sea \' ; Gk. udXcroj, \' made of crystal or \rglass,\' from CaXoj, \'glass\'; cf. Lat. hyalinus, \'glassy\' (borrowed from \rGreek). No doubt, M. was thinking of Revelation iv. 6, where the \rGreek is 0dXa<r<ra vaXlvrj 6fj.oia /tpwrrdXXy = " a sea of glass like unto \rcrystal." Cf. Tennyson\'s Juvenilia, " Twin peaks shadow\'d with pine \rslope to the dark hyaline." \r\rimpair. The usual sense in Milton is \' to harm, damage,\' which \ragrees with the etymology, impejorare, \'to make worse\'; cf. IX. 144, \r/\'. R. IV. 592, where, in each case, it is the opposite of repair. But \rsometimes, e.g. in V. 665 and vi. 690, 691, there lurks the idea of \r\' equality,\' as if M. connected it with Lat. impar, \' unequal.\' \r\rimpress, ix. 35, \'a device, generally with motto, on a coat of arms, \rscutcheon, shield.\' Also spelt imprese = lte\\. impresa, \'a device, \remblem\' ; literally \' something impressed,\' i.e. stamped. Cf. Richard II. \rIII. i. 24, 35 : \r\r"From my own windows torn my household coat, \r\rRazed out my imprese, leaving me no sign" ; \ri.e. the family coat of arms blazoned on the stained glass. \r\rinfluence, n. 1034, Late Lat. influentia, literally \'a flowing in \rupon.\' It was an astrological term applied to the power over the \rearth, men\'s characters, fortunes etc., which was supposed to descend \rfrom the celestial bodies. Cf. "planetary influence," King Lear ; i. 2. \r136, "skyey influences," Measure for Measure, III. i. 9. M. generally \ruses influence with reference to this astrological notion ; cf. iv. 669, \rVII. 374, 375 (horn Job xxxviii. 31), VIII. 513. See also Bacon\'s Essays \rOf Envy and Of Vicissitude (Pitt Press ed., pp. 21, 172). Other terms \rdue to astrology are \' disastrous \' (i. 597), \' saturnine,\' \'jovial.\' \r\rinnumerous, vn. 455 = Lat. innumerosus, \'numberless\'; a poetic \ruse. Cf. Tennyson, The Princess, v., "A lisping of the innumerous \rleaf." Thomson has it twice in Spring. \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 709 \r\rintend, n. 457, \'attend to, consider.\' A clergyman, says Selden, \r"must seriously intend his calling" (Table-Talk, p. 116). Cf. Lat. \rintendere animum. \r\rinure, n. 216, vin. 239, \'to accustom,\' literally \'to bring into \rpractice\' ( = ure). For the obsolete noun ure (O. Fr. cure, Lat. opera, \r\'work\'), cf. Bacon, Of Simulation, "it maketh him practise simu- \rlation in other things, lest his hand should be out of ure." Cf. \r\r\r\rits. In Elizabethan English the regular neuter possessive pronoun \rwas his; cf. Genesis iii. 15, "it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt \rbruise his heel." About 1600 its came into use, but slowly. Bacon \rhas its rarely: the Bible of 1611 never; the nine instances in the \rist Folio (1623) of Shakespeare may be corrupt, since in every extant \rwork published during his lifetime the old idiom his is invariable \rcf. Julius Ccesar, i. 2. 123, 124, "that same eye. ..did lose his lustre." \rMilton, as an Elizabethan in his diction, avoids its : either (i) by \rpersonifying the noun: thus in his prose abstract words like \'virtue,\' \r\'truth,\' are always followed by her\', or (2) by retaining the old neuter \ruse of his. \r\rThe only places in Milton\'s verse where its occurs are I. 254, IV. 813 : \rand Nativity Ode, 106. I know but two instances of its in his prose \rAreopagitica and The Reason of Church Government, P. W. n. 94, 471. \r\rjustle, n. \\Qi^=jostle ; connected \\v\\\\hjoust (often spelt just), from \r\\j&.jitxta, \'close to.\' For the form (then common) cf. The Tempest, \rv. 158. \r\rknot, iv. 242, \'a flower-bed.\' M. recollected Love\'s Labour\'s Lost, \rI. i. 249, "thy curious-knotted garden," i.e. laid out in nicely-arranged \rbeds. The Elizabethan physician Dr Dee says in his Diary, " I hired \rWalter Hooper, to kepe my hedges and knots in good order " (Camden \rSociety\'s ed. , p. 3). Cf. Richard //. in. 4. 43 46. It survives as a west- \rcountry word, though generally in the compound flower -knot. \r\rlandskip, n. 491 ; here and in the three other places where it \roccurs iv. 153, V. 142, L\' Allegro, 70 spelt lantskip in the original \reditions. It was a term borrowed from Dutch artists (cf. Dutch land- \rschap), and its forms in E. have been various e.g. landschaft, landschape, \rlandshape, landscip. For landskip (apparently the oldest form in E.) \rcf. Cotgrave (1611), " Paisage : Landskip, countrey worke " ; and The \rSpectator, 94, "a beautiful and spacious landskip." Tennyson uses \rlandscip in Merlin and Vivien and Romney\'s Remorse. The suffix -skip \r(or -scape), generally softened to -ship, is closely connected with the \rnoun shape. \r\rlawn, iv. 252; properly \'an open, grass-covered space in a forest, \r\r\r\r7IO PARADISE LOST. \r\ra glade clear of trees\'; hence any \'pasture* or \'green.\' A favourite \rpoetic word ; cf. Comus, 568, 965, Lycidas, 25. \r\rleviathan, i. 201, vn. 412; then commonly identified with the whale, \rthough the Hebrew livydthdn " denotes any great sea or land monster, \r\ras the crocodile or some large serpent." Cf. Psalm Ixxiv. 14, \r\r" Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces," i.e. the crocodile, \rsymbolising Egypt ; and Isaiah xxvii. i, "even leviathan that crooked \rserpent" In Psalm civ. 26, " There go the ships : there is that levia- \rthan," leviathan stands for any large sea-monster. \r\rlibbard, vn. 467 ; an Elizabethan form of leopard, so called because \rthought to be a cross-breed between a lion (Ico) and a pard, i.e. panther \r(pardus). Cf. Spenser, The Ritines of Time, "Who of the Grecian \rLibbard now ought heares?" So in Loves Labour\'s Lost, v. 2. 551. \r\rlimbec, in. 607; short for alembic, \'a vessel for distilling.\' It is \rone of those hybrid words of Arabic + Greek origin which came into \rSpain through the Moors and then passed into European languages. \rArabic al, \' the \' + a//fc, \'a still,\' from Gk. d/x/3i, 4 a cup.\' See Macbeth, \rI. 7. 67, and Dryden\'s Annus Mirabilis, stanzas 13 and 166. \r\rlimber, vn. 476, \' flexible \' ; correctly written limper, and akin to \rlimp. Cf. The Winters Tale, I. 2. 47 (where the use is figurative), \rand Giles Fletcher, Chris fs Victorie in Heaven, 57, " And oft the \rSun would cleave the limber mould" (i.e. friable). \r\rlimbo, in. 495 ; strictly a term of Roman Catholic theology. \r"The Latin word Limbus (or \'fringe\') was used in the middle ages \rfor that place on the fringe or outskirts of hell in which the just \rwho died before Christ were detained till our Lord\'s resurrection \rfrom the dead. It likewise signifies a place (also supposed to be \rbeneath the earth and on the outskirts of hell) inhabited by infants \rwho die in original sin " (Addis and Arnold, Catholic Diet.). The first \rof these was the Limbus Patrum, the second the Limbus Infantium. \rLater arose the popular belief in a third region, the Limbus Fatuorum \rthe " Paradise of Fools " (iv. 496) after death and receptacle of all vain \rand foolish things. See Henry VIII. v. 4. 67. Dante places Vergil in \rLimbo (the First Circle of his Inferno) and makes him explain who are \rthere and why (Inferno, iv. 31 63), viz. the just that "were before \rChristianity." See also the Purgatorio, vn. 2836, XXII. 97114. \r\rlist, \' wish, please \' ; commonly a present (11. 798), but also used as \ra preterite by M. (u. 656, iv. 803). Shakespeare, who uses the \rpresent tense often, once has listed \'; cf. Richard III. ill. 5. 84. Akin \rto lust, which often meant \' pleasure \' (Germ, lust) ; cf. Psalm xcii. 10, \r" Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies" (Prayer- Book). \r\rlivery, IV. 599, vn. 478; used by Elizabethan writers = any kind \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 711 \r\rof dress, garb; cf. L? Allegro, 62, "The clouds in thousand liveries \rdight." Originally livery meant whatever was given (i.e. delivered] by \ra lord to his household, whether food, money, or garments. Fr. livrer \r= Low Lat. liberare, \'to abandon.\' \r\rmalignant, x. 662, * injurious, hostile \' ; often used by Elizabethans \rwith reference to astrology, as here. Cf. i Henry VI. IV. 5. 6. \r\rmanuring, iv. 628, xi. 28. The verb manure= t to cultivate, till* \r(properly with the hand) was not uncommon in Elizabethan E. Minsheu \r(1625) has: "to manure, or till the ground, to worke and labour the \rearth with the hand." Cf. Bacon, Advancement of Learning, n. (ed. \rAldis Wright, p. 84), " It is one thing to set forth what ground lieth \runmanured, and another thing to correct ill husbandry in that which is \rmanured " ; and Othello, I. 3. 328. M. has it often in his prose-works \r(P. IV. II. 463, in. 78). And good- (or well-) mannered is still quite \ra common agricultural term for land with a good crop on it. From \rFr. mana\'uvre=\'Lovf Lat. manuopera, \'a working with the hand\' (manus). \r\rmarble, in. 564, \'bright as marble\' (from root mar-, \'to gleam\'). \rCf. Gk. napnalpeiv, \'to glisten,\' pap/jLapeos , \'glistening,\' used of the stars \ror sky. In Cymbeline, V. 4. 120, 121 Shakespeare applies "marble" \rand "radiant " to the sky in the same sentence. \r\rmarish, xn. 630 ; cognate with marsh ; cf. also mere (as in Winder- \rmere] and Germ, meer, \' the sea.\' Though common in earlier writers \r(see The Faerie Queene, V. 10. 23), marish was becoming obsolete \rwhen M. wrote; it only occurs once in the A.V., Ezekiel xlvii. n, \r" the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed," \rwhere the Genevan Bible (1562) had the same rendering. Baret\'s \rAlvearie (1580) gives, "A fenne or marise, a moore often drowned \rwith water." It is one of Tennyson\'s archaic words; cf. Mariana, \r" The cluster\'d marish-mosses crept," and The Dying Swan, 2 and 3. \r\rmaw, II. 847, x. 601, 991, \'stomach\'; cf. Germ, magen. A vulgar \rword applied rather to animals than men. Cf. Milton\'s Sonnet to \rCromwell : \r\r" Help us to save free conscience from the paw \rOf hireling wolves, whose Gospel is their maw." \r\rmeath, v. 345, a sweet wine, especially one made with honey; \r\'mead.\' Chaucer writes meth, the dialect-form still current in \rCheshire; cf. the Welsh metheglin (a sweet beverage, mentioned in \rThe Merry Wives of Windsor, V. 5. 167), from Welsh meddyglyn, \rmead-liquor.\' A.S. meodu, Gk. p0v t Sanskrit madhu, \'honey,\' are \rcognate. \r\rminim, vn. 482, \'a tiny creature\'; from Lat. minimus, \'very \rsmall.\' The use is said to survive in Cornwall, e.g. "come in, you \r\r\r\r712 PARADISE LOST. \r\rminum ! " Cf. A Mid summer -Nights Dream, III. i. 328, 3-29, "you \rdwarf, you minimus." \r\rmood, i. 550, or mode, \'key,\' \'measure,\' a musical term ; cf. S. A. \r662. Lat. modus ; distinct from mood, \' disposition \' (Germ, mutti). \r\rmysterious, vm. 599, \' full of awe \' such as befits a mystery (cf. iv. \r743, 750) like marriage; cf. Ephesians v. 32, "This is a great mystery" \rsaid in allusion to marriage. So in Comus, 785, "The sublime notion \rand high mystery." Mystery (Gk. nvar-qpiov, \' a secret rite,\' from ^tfeu>, \r\'to close the eyes or mouth\') used in a religious sense means a truth \rspecially revealed to men, or a spiritual rite of deep significance. Thus \rin the Prayer-Book it is applied to the Holy Communion. \r\rnice, iv. 741, v. 433, vm. 399; derived from Lat. nescius, \'ignorant,\' \rnice meant \'foolish,\' then \'fastidious, dainty,\' i.e. foolish in a particular \rway. So here and in P. R. iv. 157, " Nothing will please the difficult \rand nice" i.e. people hard to satisfy (difficiles). Few words improve \rin sense as nice has. \r\roblivious, i. 266, \'causing to forget, producing forgetfulness \' ; cf. \rMacbeth, v. 3. 43, "some sweet oblivious antidote." So Horace uses \robliviosus of wine (Odes II. 7. 21) ; and M. speaks of obliviosce...Lethes \raqua in De Idea Platonica, 20. Pope borrowed Milton\'s phrase ; cf. \rThe Dunciad, ill. 43, 44: \r\r"Oh ! born to see what none can see awake ! \rBehold the wonders of th\' oblivious lake." \r\robnoxious; always used by M. in its Latin sense \'liable to\' (ob- \rnoxius). Cf. The Tenure of Kings, "made obnoxious to the doom \rof law," and The Reason of Church Government, I. 6, "from that time \rhis creature, and obnoxious to comply with his ends in state " (P. W. \rn. 32, 461). So in ix. 170, 1094, and S. A. 106. Cf. Bacon, Of \rAmbition, "as for the having of them obnoxious to ruin, if they be of \rfearful natures, it may do well." \r\robvious ; always used by M. in one of the senses of Latin obvius \re.g. \' coming to meet\' (vm. 504, X. 106), or \' lying in the way\' (vi. 69). \r\rofficious, vm. 99 ; used = Lat. officiosus, \' obliging, ready to serve by \rdoing officia, i.e. kind acts.\' Cf. P. R. II. 302, where Satan, coming \rback after his first repulse, says, "With granted leave officious I return," \ri.e. eager to serve Christ. \r\ropacous, in. 418, vm. 23; from Lat. opacus, \'dark,\' but more \rcommonly opaque as in in. 619 ; cf. Fr. opaque. Minsheu has, \r"Opacwous, shadowie, darke and blacke." \r\rorient, I. 546, n. 399, in. 507, \' bright, lustrous.\' In Elizabethan \rpoetry it is a constant epithet of gems, especially pearls. Perhaps, used \rthus, it first meant \' eastern,\' gems coming from the Orient or East ; \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 713 \r\rthen as these were bright it got the notion \' lustrous,\' which suits, I \rbelieve, every passage where M. uses it, though in one or two places \r(e.g. in IV. 644) \' rising \' = Lat. oriens is possible. Commonly he \rapplies it to jewels or liquids; cf. v. 2, Comus, 65. \r\ro\\ve, ix. 1141 ; in its original sense \' to have, possess.\' Cf. Macbeth, \rI. 4. 10, "To throw away the dearest thing he owed," and The Tempest, \rIII. i. 45. Closely akin to own. \r\rpanim, I. 765 ; another form of pagan, from Late Lat. paganus, \r\'heathen.\' Strictly O.E. paynyme meant \'heathendom,\' \'the country of \rthe heathen,\' and a \'heathen man\' was payen or payn. Tennyson uses \rpaynim often in the Idylls of the King. \r\rparamount, n. 508, \'lord, chief; originally a legal term for the \rlord of an estate under whom land was rented. Cf. Blount\'s Glosso- \rgraphia, " Paramount is in our Law the highest Lord of the Fee." \rO. Fr. paramont, \'at the top, above \' = Lat. per + ad montem. \r\rpavilion, II. 960, \'palace.\' M. refers to Psalm xviii. n, "He made \rdarkness his secret place ; his pavilion round about him were dark \rwaters and thick clouds of the skies " where, however, the sense is \rless \'palace\' than \'tent,\' as sometimes in M. Cf. v. 653, XI. 215. \rThrough Fr. pavilion from Lat. papilio, \'a butterfly,\' used by Late Latin \rwriters to mean \'a tent\' because a tent is spread out like the wings of a \rbutterfly. \r\rpioner, I. 676 ; O. Fr. peonier, \' foot-soldier,\' Ital. pedone. For-er= \r-eer as a suffix in Elizabethan E. cf. "charioter," vi. 390 ; "mutiner," \rCoriolamts, I. 1.254; "enginer" and "pioner," Hamlet, I. 5. 163 and \rin. 4. -206. \r\rpitch, vni. 198. A term in falconry for the height to which a hawk \rsoars. Cf. Richard If. I. i. 109, "How high a pitch his resolution \rsoars ! " M. perhaps refers to this use ; cf. " lower flight" 199. \r\rplat, ix. 456 ; another form of plot, \' a small piece of ground.\' Cf. \r2 Kings ix. 26, "and I will requite thee in this plat... Now therefore \rtake and cast him into the plat of ground." So in // Penseroso, 73 : \r"Oft, on a plat of rising ground, \rI hear the far-off curfew sound." \r\rplumb-down, II. 933, \'straight down, in a vertical line.\' Plumb \rmeant (i) a mass of lead (Lat. plumbum], attached to a cord and used \rin determining whether a wall is perpendicular ; (2) the vertical or per- \rpendicular position so determined. In modern E. b has softened into \rp= plump, \'straight downward.\' \r\rpomp; apart from its ordinary meanings (i. 372, II. 257) it is used \rlike Gk. 7ro/*7n7, Lat. pompa, in the two kindred senses \' solemn pro- \rcession \' (vil. 564), and \'train, retinue\' (vni. 61). Cf. King John, \r\r\r\r714 PARADISE LOST. \r\rin. i. 304. Bullokar\'s Expositor, an old (1616) English dictionary, \rhas, " Po mfc... a solemn trained \r\rponder, iv. 1001 ; in the literal sense of Lat. ponderare, \' to weigh \' ; \ra rare use, but cf. Surrey\'s Poems : \r\r" Hot gleams of burning fire, and easy sparks of flame, \r\rIn balance of unequal weight he pondereth by aim." \rThe old English-Lat. Dictionary called Manipulus Vocabulonim (1570) \rhas, " to ponder, ponderare, librare" \r\rportcullis, ii. 874, a kind of grating, made of timber or iron, sliding \rup and down in vertical grooves, and forming part of a gateway. Here \rthe portcullis came down over and protected the lock of the gate : \rSin had to raise it before she could get at the keyhole. Lat. porta \rcolattca, \'a sliding door\'; cf. Fr. cottier, \'to flow,\' coulisse, \'a slide, \rgroove. \' \r\rprevent, u. 467, 739, x. 987, \'to anticipate, forestall\'; cf. Psalm \rcxix. 148, " Mine eyes prevent the night watches," and i Thessalonians \riv. 15, "we which are alive... shall not prevent them which are asleep," \ri.e. \'rise before.\' Literally \'to come before,\' Lat. pravenire. \r\rprick, II. 536, \'to ride hard,\' literally \'to spur a horse on\'; cf. \rTennyson, Gareth and Lynette, " And Gareth crying prick\'d against \rthe cry." See The Faerie Queene, I. i. i, v. 10. 31. In Piers the \rPloiuman \' \' prykiere " = a rider. \r\rpuny, ii. 367; perhaps in the literal sense \'born later, younger,\' \rmankind having been created after the angels; cf. the Areopagitica, \r" like a puny with his guardian," i.e. a young man not yet of age (P. IV. \rII. 79). But \'weak, inferior* would also suit. The term "Puisne \rJudge" shows the etymology (Fr. puts nt). \r\rpurchase, x. 579, \'prey.\' The verb purchase meant first \'to hunt \rafter\' (O. Yr.purchacer=.Yr. pour + chasser) ; "then to take in hunting; \rthen to acquire; and then, as the commonest way of acquiring is by \rgiving money in exchange, to buy" (Trench). \'To acquire, gain\' \rwas a common Elizabethan sense; cf. i Timothy iii. 13, "they that \rhave used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good \rdegree" (Revised Version "gain"). \r\rpurlieu, II. 833, \'anoutskirt\'; strictly of a forest, as in iv. 404. Some- \rtimes land which had been taken from its owner and made part of a \rforest was restored to him or his successor. The process whereby this \rwas done was called perambulatio = \' a walking over the land to settle \rits boundaries\'; then the land itself came in legal Latin to be called \rperambulatio, rendered in French by potiralle. The form purlieu, \rfrom pourallee, was influenced by a wrong derivation from Fr. pur \rlieu =purus locus, \' a space clear of trees.\' \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 715 \r\r\r\rpurple, IV. 764. Lat. purpureus, like Gk. Trop^tfpeos, was not \rlimited to what we call \' purple,\' but denoted almost any rich colour, \re.g. red, rosy, crimson, and in poets any dazzling, bright hue (as where \rHorace applies it to white swans, Odes iv. i. 10). We find the same \rwide use in English (especially the Elizabethan) poets. Thus in \rShakespeare it is used of blood several times; cf. Romeo and Juliet \', \rI. i. 92. Often it is only a picturesque, literary epithet, as in Gray\'s \r" The bloom of young Desire, and purple light of Love" {Progress of \rPoesy, 41); cf. iv. 763, 764, and Vergil\'s lumen juventa purpureum \r(ALn. I. 590, 591). \r\rpurpose, iv. 337, vin. 337; in sense and origin = Fr. propos, \'con- \rversation.\' So the verb propose = \' talk\' in Shakespeare, e.g. in Much \rAdo About Nothing, in. i. 2, 3: \r\r" There shall thou find my cousin Beatrice \rProposing with the prince and Claudio." \r\rSpenser often has pttrpose = \' discourse \' ; cf. The Faerie Queene, I. \r12, 13. \r\rquarry, x. 281, \'prey\' ; a hunting-term. O. Fr. cuiree, the intes- \rtines of a slain animal, the part given to the hounds ; so called because \rwrapped in the skin Fr. cuir, \'a skin, hide,\' from Lat. corium, \'hide.\' \r\rquire, in. 217, 666, vn. 254; the older form of choir \\ each from \rLat. chorus. Cf. the Prayer-Book, "In quires and places where they \rsing." Quire was one of the Latin words introduced through Christianity. \r\rramp, iv. 343, vn. 466; a word used in several allied senses, \re.g. \'to rage\' cf. "a ramping and a roaring lion," Psalm xxii. 13, \rPrayer- Book ; \' to tear, snatch\' ; \'to rear up on the hind legs \' cf. the \rheraldic term "lion rampant"; \'to spring.\' Cf. S. A. 139, "his lion \rramp "= lion-like spring. Fr. ramper, \'to climb.\' \r\rrapt, m. 522, vn. 23, \'caught up.\' It should be written rapped, \rbeing the p. p. of an old verb rap, \' to seize\' ; cf. Cymbeline, I. 6. 51, \r"what... raps you?" i.e. excites you? The form rapt comes through \rconfusion (of sound and sense) with Lat. raptus, the p. p. of rapere, \r\'to seize.\' \r\rravin, x. 599, \'prey\' ; cf. The Faerie Queene, I. n. 12 (the descrip- \rtion of the \' Old Dragon \') : \r\r"his deepe devouring jawes \rWyde gaped, like the griesly mouth of hell, \rThrough which into his darke abysse all ravin fell." \rO. Fr. ravine, Lat. rapina, \'plunder.\' \r\rreck, \' to care \' ; A.S. reccan. M. uses the word both personally \r(II. 50, IX. 173) and impersonally; cf. Lycidas, 122, "What recks it \rthem? What need they? They are sped," and Comus, 404. In Shake- \r\r\r\r716 PARADISE LOST. \r\rspeare it is always personal, as in Hamlet, I. 3. 51 ("recks not his own \rrede"). M. uses reckoning with the strict etymological notion of \'caring, \rtroubling,\' in the phrase to \'make little reckoning of \' ; cf. Comus, 642, \rLycidas, 116. The old word wretchless means \'careless,\' the w having \rbeen prefixed wrongly; cf. the Articles of Religion, xvii. \r\rrecorder, i. 551, a kind of flute or flageolet; cf. the title of a \rmusical work published in 1686, "The Delightful Companion, or \rChoice New Lessons for the Recorder or Flute" So called from the \rold verb record^ 1 to sing\' ; cf. Fairfax, Tasso, II. 97, " to hear the lark \rrecord her hymns." Selden says in his Table-Talk: "a bird, by often \rwhistling to, learns a tune, and a month after records to herself" (p. 149, \rReynolds\' ed.). By " soft " M. implies not effeminate strains but the \rsweet, subdued notes of the instrument ; cf. Fletcher\'s Piscatorie Eclogues, \rVii. 3, "the sad recorder sweetly plains." \r\rrhyme ; spelt (in the First Ed.) rhime in I. 16 but rime (the \rproper spelling, A.S. rim) in the Preface. Possibly M. used rhime \r(i.e. rhyme) = poetry opposed to prose, and rime= rhymed metre \ropposed to blank verse. The spelling rhyme is due to confusion with \rrhythm, Gk. pvdndt. \r\rSatoaean, iv. 162, \'belonging to Saba. 1 Saba is the classical form, \rused in the Septuagint and Vulgate, of Sheba, which "embraced the \rgreater part of Arabia Felix" (Smith\'s Bible Diet.). The Eliza- \rbethans constantly write Saba; cf. Marlowe\'s Fanstus, v. 154, "As \rwise as Saba" (i.e. the Queen of Sheba), and XH. 12, "India, Saba, \rand farther countries in the east." In Comus, 996 (" Elysian dew"), \rthe Cambridge MS. shows that the earlier reading was Sabizan. \r\rsad, v. 94, vi. 541, \'serious\' ; the original sense was \'sated,\' A.S. \rseed being akin to Lat. satis ; then came the notion \'serious, sober, \rgrave,\' as often in Shakespeare. Cf. An Apology for Smectymnuus, \r"to be severe and ever of a sad gravity," and the History of Britain, \r" this story, though seeming otherwise too light in the midst of a sad \rnarration" (P. W. ill. 129, v. 387). Cf. Comus > 189, // Penseroso, 43. \r\rsatiate, i. 179. Elizabethan English often makes the past parti- \rciples of verbs of Latin origin conform with the Latin. This is the \rcase especially with verbs of which the Latin originals belong to the ist \rand 3rd conjugations. Cf. elevate (n. 558) = Lat. elevatus and suspense \r(II. 4\\8)=suspensus. Further, participles not from the Latin are ab- \rbreviated by analogy; e.g. Milton (i. 193) has uplift = \'uplifted,\' \rthough lift is of Scandinavian origin. \r\rscathe, I. 613, \'to injure\'; rare as verb, but cf. Romeo and Juliet, \rI. 5. 86, "This trick may chance to scathe you." For the noun cf. \rKing John, II. 75, "To do offence and scath in Christendom." The \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 717 \r\rManipulus Vocabulorum (1570) has, "to scathe, nocere," and Minsheu \r(1617), " to scathe, or hurt." \r\rsciential, ix. 837, \'yielding knowledge.\' Ben Jonson in a compli- \rment to James I. says (Masque of Blackness] : \r\r" His light sciential is, and, past mere nature, \rCan salve the rude defects of every creature." \r\rscull, VII. 402 ; the same word as shoal and school\', cf. the nautical \rexpression \' a school of fish.\' Scull is used specially of fish ; cf. Shake- \rspeare, Troilus and Cressida, V. 5. 22. On some coasts (e.g. the \rsouth-eastern) of England her ring- shoals are still called sculls. In the \rNew Forest dialect scull is used contemptuously for \' a set of low \rpeople.\' \r\rsdein, iv. 50; cf. Spenser, The Faerie Queene, III. i. 55: \r"For great rebuke it is love to despise, \r\rOr rudely sdeigne a gentle hart\'s [heart\'s] request." \rThis form is modelled on Ital. sdegnare, while the common form disdain \rcomes through O. Fr. desdegner. Lat. dis-, a negative prefix, + dignari, \r\' to think worthy (dignus).\'\' \r\rsecure, iv. 186, v. 238, ix. 371, x. 779. Elizabethan writers often \ruse secure in the sense of Lat. securus, \' free from anxiety, unconcerned \' ; \ri.e. to indicate a false feeling rather than actual state of safety. Cf. \rFletcher\'s quibbling lines: \r\r" To secure yourselves from these, \r\rBe not too secure in ease " ; \r\rand M. in Eikonoklastes, 18, "with a bloody surprise [he] falls on \rour secure forces which lay quartering at Brentford, in the thoughts \rand expectation of a treaty,\'" P. W. I. 442. So security\' over-con- \rfidence, carelessness,\' in Macbeth, in. 5. 32. "Captain Secure" is \rslain alongside of "Captain Boasting" in The Holy War. \r\rseneshal, ix. 38, \'steward \'; literally \' old servant,\' whence the idea \r* senior in standing, chief.\' Through O. Fr. from Gothic sins, \' old \' \r+ shalks, \'servant\'; cf. marshal, literally \'horse-servant.\' \r\rSeraphim ; then supposed to come from a Hebrew root \' to burn \' ; \rcf. Blount, "Seraphim, i.e. fulgentes aut comburcntes\', so called, for \rtheir burning with divine love and charity." Hence "fiery Seraphim," \rII. 512 ; " brightest Seraphim," ill. 381, and in At a Solemn Mustek, 10. \rReally Seraphim is from a root \' to exalt,\' and means \' the exalted \rones.\' \r\rThe plural of Seraph (in. 667) has much the same history as Cherub; \rSeraphins in some old writers cf. Thomas Watson\'s Eglogue (1590), \r" where Seraphins \\ doe Praise the highest in their glorious flames " \r(Arber, p. 169) ; Seraphims in the Bible, Isaiah vi. 2, 6; Seraphim in \r\r\r\r718 PARADISE LOST. \r\rM. Crashaw uses Seraphim several times as a singular in his beautiful \rpoem The Flaming Heart, on Saint Teresa, e.g., \r\r"This is a Seraphim, they say, \rAnd this the great Teresia." \r\rsere, x. 1071, \'dry\'; also spelt sear, A.S. sear, \'dry.\' Commonly \rsaid of flowers or leaves, with the sense \'faded,\' \'withered,\' as in \rLycidas, 2, "ivy never sere." \r\rsewer, ix. 38 ; a servant who set the dishes on the table at a feast \rand removed them. In Eikonoklastes, 24, M. refers contemptuously \rto the chaplains of Charles I. as " the sewers, or the yeomen-ushers \rof devotion," P. W. I. 459. Connected with A.S. seaw, \'pottage.\' \r\rshroud, x. 1068. Properly shroud, A.S. scrtid, meant \'a garment\': \rhence any * shelter, covering,\' as often in Elizabethan writers. Cf. \rComus, 147, " Run to your shrouds within these brakes and trees." \rOutside Old St Paul\'s Cathedral in London there was a covered place \rcalled " the Shrouds," where sermons were preached in wet weather, \rinstead of at St Paul\'s Cross, which was in the open. \r\rSoldan, i. 764, \' Sultan \' ; cf. Minsheu (1625), " the great Soldane, \ror Sultan among the Turks or Persians." It is a thoroughly mediaeval \rword cf. the Inferno, V. 60 used often in reference to the Crusades ; \rcf. The Talisman. From Arabic Sultan, \'victorious,\' Latinised as \rSoldanus, whence Ital. soldano, \r\rSophi, x. 433 ; a corruption of Arabic safi, \' elect, chosen,\' which \rwas a title, like the \' Caesar \' of the Roman emperors, borne by each \rShah or sovereign of the dynasty that ruled Persia from 1505 to 1725. \rIn Elizabethan writers the expression \' the Sophy \' (or \' Soph* \') is \rexactly equivalent to \' the Shah \' in modern English. Cf. The Merchant \rof Venice, II. i. 25, "That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince"; and \rBen Jonson\'s Volpone, ill. 5, "the Persian Sophi\'s wife." Persia is \rcalled "the Sophian Empire" in Hexham\'s English edition (1636) of \rMer eater\'s Atlas, n. 411. \r\rsound, n. 604, vii. 399, \'a strait, narrow strip of water.\' Cf. \rComus, 115, "The sounds and seas, with all their finny drove" (i.e. \rshoals of fish). A.S. sund meant literally \' a strait of the sea that \rcould be swum across.\' \r\rsovran, i. 246, II. 244 ; spelt thus always in P. L.\\ cf. Ital. sovrano. \rThe common form sovereign = O. Fr. soverain, later souverain. Lat. \rsuferanus, \' chief. \' \r\rspangle, vn. 384, XI. 130, \' to ornament as with spangles.\' Spangle \rwas used of small flashing ornaments like the little circles of silver in \r\' tinsel.\' Elizabethan writers often apply it to the stars ; cf. The \rTaming of the Shrew, iv. 5. 31, "What stars do spangle heaven with \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 719 \r\rsuch beauty?" So in Comus, 1003 (an echo of A Midsummer-Night\'s \rDream, II. i. 29), and Lycidas, 170. \r\rstate, x. 445, \'canopy\'; more often \'chair of state, canopied \rthrone,\' as in Macbeth, ill. 4. 5, "Our hostess keeps her state." \rCotgrave, French Dictionary, 1611, explains dais by: "A cloth of \rEstate, Canopie or Heauen, that stands ouer the heads of Princes \rthrones, also, the whole State or seat of Estate." \r\rstore, in. 444, v. 322, \'abundance\'; common in Elizabethan E. \rOne of Hey wood\'s Proverbs runs, "store is no sore." Cf. L? Allegro, \r121. O. Fr. estoire, \'store, provisions,\' Low Lat. instaurum. \r\rsublimed, I. 235. In chemistry to * sublime\' or \' sublimate\' is "to \rraise a solid substance into vapour by heat." M. means that the \rmaterial substance catching fire is raised to a state of pure flame. \r\rsuccess, II. 9, 123; its usual sense in Elizabethan E. is \'result, \rfortune\' how a person fares in a matter, or a thing turns out, whether \rwell or ill. Cf. Shakespeare, Troilus and Cressida, II. 2. 117, "Nor \rfear of bad success in a bad cause." So P. R. iv. i. \r\rsuccinct, in. 643 ; Lat. succinctus, the past participle of succingere, \r\' to gird, tuck up.\' Cf. 7^he Rape of the Lock, in. 41, 42 : \r" Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band, \rCaps on their heads, and halberds in their hands." \r\rsuggestion, ix. 90, \'temptation\'; cf. Macbeth, i. 3. 134, "why do \rI yield to that suggestion?" So the verb; cf. Richard II. in. 4. \r75 76: \r\r"What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee \rTo make a second fall of cursed man?" \r\rsummed, vn. 421 ; a term in falconry, applied to a hawk that \rhas the feathers full-grown and in full number. Cf. P. R. I. 14, \r"with prosperous wing full summed"; and Drayton\'s Polyolbion, \rSong u, "The muse from Cambria comes with pinions summed and \rsound." \r\rsung. In Elizabethan E. this incorrect form for the past tense is \rmuch used. Shakespeare has sang only once (Sonnet 73), and then for \rthe rhyme. In M. sang occurs only three times, III. 383, VII. 192, \rLycidas, 186, and in each case he probably used the form for a special \rconsideration of sound (e.g. in in. 383, vn. 192 to avoid the jingle \rsung. ..son}. Similarly he has rung (n. 655, 723, ix. 737) as the past \rtense of ring, except in the Nativity Ode, 158, where the rhyme requires \rrang. Cf. too sprung (vn. 58, vill. 46). \r\rsurcease, vi. 258, \'to cease, stop \'; cf. 6". A. 404, and Shakespeare, \rLiter ece, 1766, " If they surcease to be that should survive." Origi- \rnally a surcease, O. Fr. sursis (for the noun, cf. Macbeth, I. 7. 4), was \rthe arrest or stoppage of a legal suit. O. Fr. surseior, \' to pause.\' \r\r\r\r720 PARADISE LOST. \r\rSyrtis, n. 939, Gk. Sifyms, the name of certain quicksands and sand- \rbanks off the coast of N. Africa ; the word came to mean any quicksand \ror sandbank as here. \r\rtake ; a common Elizabethan sense was \' to enchant, captivate,\' \respecially by supernatural influence; cf. Hamlet, i. i. 163. Hence \rthe general meaning \'to charm\' (n. 554); cf. Bacon, Of Masques, \r4 \'things... such as do naturally take the sense." So in Tennyson\'s \rDying Swan, 1 1 1 : \r\r"The wild swan\'s death-hymn took the soul \rOf that waste place with joy." \r\rtarge, IX. mi, \'a shield\'; cf. Antony and Cleopatra, II. 6. 39, \r"targes undinted," i.e. not battered by blows. Of course, target is \ra diminutive of targe and formerly was used =\' shield \' ; cf. Coriolanus, \riv. 5. 126; Hamlet, ii. 2. 334. A mark to fire at is called \'a target\' \rfrom its resemblance to a round shield. \r\rted, ix. 450, \'to spread mown grass\'; a Scandinavian word. Cf. \rEuphues : " When wealth cometh into the hands of youth before they \rcan use it, then fall they to all disorder that may be, tedding that with \ra fork in one year which was not gathered together with a rake in \rtwenty" (Bond\'s Lyly, II. pp. 15, 16). So in Lyly\'s (?) prose-piece \rPap with a Hatchet : \'\' What fool more covetous than he that seeks to \rted abroad the Church\'s goods with a fork, or scratch it to himself \rwith a rake?" (Bond, ill. 412). \r\rthrall, i. 149, x. 402 ; enthrall, n. 551 ; from Icelandic \\>rcell, \r\'a serf,\' Danish tral\\ no doubt, thrall came into England through \rthe Danes. Strictly it meant \' a runner,\' i.e. on messages, the original \rroot being that seen in Gk. T/>^X CIJ/ > \' to nin.\' \r\rthwart, iv. 557, \'to cross\'; as a verb now only figurative =\' to \rhinder,\' but then used also in the literal sense \' to pass across \' as here; \rcf. Pericles, IV. 4. 10. Minsheu has, " Traverser. To thwart, or goe \roverthwart, crosse or passe over." The etymological sense is seen in \rMilton\'s use of the adjective (x. 1075). \r\rtiar, in. 625, \'a crown\'; strictly \'a wreathed ornament for the head\' \r(such as the Persians wore). Gk. ndpa (or ndpaj) is a Persian word, \rperhaps from Persian tdjwar, \' crowned \' ; hence Lat. tiara, Fr. tiare. \rTennyson speaks of flowers "studded white with disks and tiars" \r(Arabian Nights}. \r\rtine, X. 1075, \'to kindle\'; cf. The Faerie Queenc, ill. 10. 13, \r"To quench the flames which she had tyn\'d before," and Fletcher\'s \rApollyonists : \r\r" Oil ! why should earthly lights then scorn to tine \r\rTheir lamps alone at that first sunne divine." \rAn obsolete verb, also spelt tind ; cf. tinder. The Dialect Diet, shows \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 721 \r\rthat the word survives in several forms, e.g. tindle, \'a bonfire \' (Derby- \rshire), teening-time, \'lighting-up time\' (Cornwall), candle-teening (or \rfining), ( dusk.\' \r\rtinsel, IX. 36 ; a shining, silver-like cloth. M. renders the Homeric \repithet for the goddess Thetis, dpyvpdTrefa, \' silver-footed,\' by \' tinsel- \rslippered,\' Comus, 877. Fr. etincelle, Lat. scintilla, \'a spark.\' \r\rtire, vi. 605 ; the old form of tier; cf. The Faerie Queene, I. 4. 35. \rIt seems to have been specially used of a line of cannon ; Skeat quotes \rFlorio (1598), "a tyre of ordinance." From Fr. tirer, \'to draw.\' \r\rtouch, iv. 686 ; often applied thus to the action of the hand on \ra musical instrument. Cf. The Passionate Pilgrim > 107, 108: \r\r" whose heavenly touch \rUpon the lute doth ravish human sense." \r\rtrains, xi. 624; cf. S. A. 533, "venereal trains " = snares of love, \rand Cormts, 151. Shakespeare has the noun once (Macbeth, iv. 3. 118), \rthe verb several times, e.g. in i Henry IV. v. i. 21. From Fr. trainer \rtrahere, which in Late Lat. = \'to betray\' : the metaphor (says Du Cange) \rof alluring birds into snares. Cf. the Animadversions, "he. ..trains on \rthe easy Christian insensibly within the close ambushment of worst \rerrors," P. W. ill. 43. \r\rtrepidation, in. 483; Lat. trepidatio, \'a trembling,\' from trepidare, \r\'to tremble.\' For the literal use of the word, cf. Bacon, The Advance- \rment of Learning, bk. 11. 2. 8: "As it cometh to pass in massive bodies, \rthat they have certain trepidations and waverings before they fix and \rsettle, so it seemeth that by the providence of God this monarchy, before \rit was to settle in your majesty and your generations (in which I hope \rit is now established for ever), it had these prelusive changes and \rvarieties." \r\rtriumph, xi. 723, "a public festivity or exhibition of any kind," \rSchmidt, Lexicon\', cf. A Midsummer- Nighfs Dream, I. i. 19, "With \rpomp, with triumph and with revelling." So often in Bacon, e.g. in \rhis History of Henry VII. p. 98 (" he kept great triumphs of jousting \rand tourney"), p. 187, and p. 219, Pitt Press ed. See I? Allegro t 120. \rIn this sense the word is usually plural. Lat. triumphus G\\a. dplapfios, \ra hymn to Bacchus. \r\rtroll, xi. 620, \'to roll\'; still used in its literal sense in many counties, \re.g. to troll a ball or hoop or wheel. In Yorkshire *7V0//-egg-day\' was \ran old name for Easter-Monday and Shrove-Tuesday, because on those \rdays children played with hard-boiled, dyed eggs, rolling them on the \rgrass. \r\runcouth, ii. 407, 827; A.S. uncuft, \'unknown\' from un, \'not\' \r+ cttf$, the p.p. of cunnan, \'to know.\' In M. it means \'strange, un- \r\rP. L. 46 \r\r\r\r722 PARADISE LOST. \r\rfamiliar,\' perhaps with the implied notion \' unpleasant\'; cf. V. 98, VI. \r362. So in Titus Andronicns, n. 3. 211, "I am surprised with an \runcouth fear," and As You Like //, n. 6. 6. \r\runenvled, II. 23. Elizabethan writers constantly treat the termi- \rnation -ed, which belongs to the passive participle, as equal to the \radjectival ending -able; especially with words which have the negative \rprefix -, and the sense \'that may not be.\' Cf. II. 337, 903. So \r" unvalued " = \' invaluable,\' " unavoided " = \' inevitable,\' Richard III. \rI. 4. 27, IV. 4. 217. The use of the participial and adjectival endings \rwas less regular then than now. \r\runweeting, x. 335, 916. M. always uses this form, never unwitting; \rthe ee represents the sound of the long / in A.S. wttan, \' to know,\' \rwhich comes from the same root as Gk. olda and ISelv and Lat. videre. \r\rutter, i. 72, ill. 16, V. 614; the comparative of A.S. #/, \'out,\' \rand an older form of outer. Lawyers still speak of " the utter bar" in \rcontrast with "the inner bar." Cf. Blount\'s Glossographia (1656): \r"The outward or Utter Barristers... these always plead without [i.e. \routside] the Bar." In Ezekiel x. 5 the Bible used to read "utter \rcourt." \r\rvans, n. 927, \'wings\'; Ital. vanni, from Lat. vannus, \'a winnowing- \rfan." 1 Cf. P. R. iv. 583, "plumy vans" (said of angels\' wings), and \rTennyson\'s Love and Death, "Love wept and spread his sheeny vans \rfor flight." For van=fan cf. vat = fat as in \' wine^/a/.\' The Manipuhis \rVocabulorum (1570) gives an old verb "to vanne, vannarc? i.e. \'to \rwinnow.\' \r\rvirtue; often (vn. 236, vin. 95, ix. no, 145, 616, 649) used by M. \rin the sense \'efficacy, might\' ; cf. Luke viii. 46, "virtue is gone out of \rme": hence virtuous= \'full of efficacy\' (ix. 795, 1033). Also = \' courage \' \r(i. 320, X. 372), i.e. what a man (vir) should specially be, viz. \'brave\'; \rLat. virtus, \'worth, manly excellence, valour\' (Lat. vir, \' man \'). This \retymological use is well illustrated in the Life of Coriolanus in North\'s \rPlutarch : "Now in those days valiantness was honoured in Rome above \rall other virtues: which they call virtus, by the name of virtue itself, \ras including in that general name all other special virtues besides. So \rthat virtus in the Latin was as much as valiantness. " \r\rvouchsafe, n. 332, vii. 80, vin. 8. Spelt voutsafe in the original \reditions, and perhaps we ought to keep the form, as some editors do. \rM. may have wished to avoid the awkward sound ch before s, just as \rin proper names he avoids sh. \r\rwaft, ii. 1042 ; often used (as here) by Elizabethan writers with the \rsense \' to journey, or carry, over water.\' Cf. 2 Henry VI. iv. r. 114, \r" I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel "; and P. R. i. 104. \r\r\r\rGLOSSARY. 723 \r\rwanton. The word means literally \'unrestrained \' ; hence \'luxuriant,\' \ras used of growth, IX. 211. Cf. A Midsummer- Night\'s Dream, n. i. \r99, 100: \r\r"And the quaint mazes in the wanton green \r\rFor lack of tread are undistinguishable." \r\rOf motion it implies \' tossing about,\' e.g. like the \' undulating \' coils \rof a serpent (ix. 517). \r\rwarp, I. 341 ; a nautical term (Scandinavian) = " to move into some \rdesired place or position by hauling on a rope or warp which has been \rfastened to something fixed, as a buoy, anchor, or other ship at or near \rthat place or position : as, to warp a ship into harbor or to her berth " \r(Century Diet.}. M. uses it to describe \'undulatory forward motion,\' \rand Thomson imitates him ; cf. Spring : \r\r"Myriads on myriads, insect armies warp \r\rKeen in the poisoned breeze." \rIn either case comparison with a sailing ship is implied. \r\rweed, \'a garment\'; A.S. weed, \'a garment, dress.\' Quite a Miltonic \rword; cf. L? Allegro, 119, 120: \r\r"Where throngs of knights and barons bold, \r\rIn weeds of peace, high triumphs hold " ; \r\rwhich is an echo of Troilus and Cressida, in. 3. 239, "To see great \rHector in his weeds of peace." So in Coimts, 16, 84, and 390 (" For \rwho would rob a hermit of his weeds? "). The singular is rare, but cf. \rA Midsummcr-Nighfs Dream, 11. i. 255, 256: \r\r"And there the snake throws her enamell\'d skin, \r\rWeed wide enough to wrap a fairy in." \r\rNow a poetical or dialect (e.g. Scottish) usage, apart from the phrase \r"widow\'s weeds"; cf. Tennyson, In Mcmoriam, v. : \r\r"In words like weeds, I\'ll wrap me o\'er." \r\rwelkin, \'sky\'; properly a plural word =\' clouds \'; cf. Germ, wolke, \r\'a cloud.\' The termination -in (for -en] is the plural ending which \rwe get in brethren, children, oxen. M. uses welkin only twice (n. 538, \rComus, 1015), and it was perhaps an affected word (Twelfth Night, \rin. i. 65). \r\rwignt, ii. 613, \' person, being\' ; A.S. iviht, \'a creature.\' It was \rrather an old-fashioned word of ballad-poetry; Shakespeare seems to \rridicule it, putting it in the mouth of the bombastic Pistol; cf. The \rMerry Wives of Windsor, I. 3. 23, Henry V. II. i. 64. \r\rwon, vn. 457, \'dwell\'; cf. The Faerie Queene, n. 7. 49, "The \rfairest wight that wonneth under skie." From A.S. wiinian, which \rmeant (i) \'to dwell,\' (2) \'to be accustomed\'; now obsolete except in \rthe second sense and in the past participle wont or wonted. Similarly \r\r46 2 \r\r\r\r724 PARADISE LOST. \r\rthe cognate Germ. wohnen-=(i] \'to dwell,\' (2) \'to be wont.\' M. uses \rwont, in the second sense \'to be accustomed,\' as a present tense and a \rpreterite; though I. 764 and the Nativity Ode, 10, seem the only un- \rdoubted cases of the latter. \r\rwreak, iv. u, \'to avenge.\' This was the original sense of wreak \r(cognate with Germ, rdcken, \'to avenge\'). The Manipulus Vocabulorum \r(1570) has "to wreake, vlcisci, vindicare" Cf. Tennyson, Gareth and \rLynette, "Kill the foul thief, and wreak me for my son." The first \rtwo editions of P. L. have wreck, which is practically another form of \rwreak. \r\ryeanling, in. 434, \'just born.\' "The difference between ean and \ryean is easily explained ; in the latter, the prefixed y- represents the \rvery common A.S. prefix ge-, readily added to any verb without affecting \rthe sense " (Skeat). Hence ean = A.S. ednian : yean = A. S. ge-ednian \rboth meaning \'to bring forth young, \'\'i.e. of any kind ; but now ean or \ryean is commonly used of sheep. Shakespeare uses eanling=* young \rlamb,\' in The Merchant of Venice, I. 3. 80. \r\r\r\rI.
