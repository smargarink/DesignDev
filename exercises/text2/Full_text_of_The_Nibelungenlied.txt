Translations are at best but \rpoor substitutes for originals. A new translation of a poem implies \ralso a criticism of those that have preceded it. My apology for \rpresenting this new English version of the Nibelungenlied is that \rnone of those hitherto made has reproduced the metrical form of \rthe original. In the hope of making the outlines of the poem \rclearer for the modern reader, I have endeavored to supply in the \rIntroduction a historical background by summing up the results \rof investigation into its origin and growth.

THE NIBELUNGEN SAGA \r\ri. Origin of the Saga \r\rAll the Aryan peoples have had their heroic age, the achieve- \rments of which form the basis of later saga. For the Germans \rthis was the period of the Migrations, as it is called, in round num- \rbers the two hundred years from 40 , tQ . 600. at the close of which \rwe find them settled in those regions which they have, generally \rspeaking, occupied ever since. During these two centuries kalei- \rdoscopic changes had been taking place in the position of the vari- \rous Germanic tribes. Impelled partly by a native love of wander- \ring, partly by the pressure of hostile peoples of other race, they \rmoved with astonishing rapidity hither and thither over the face \rof Europe, generally in conflict with one another or buffeted by \rthe Romans in the west and south, and by the Huns in the east. \rIn this stern struggle for existence and search for a permanent \rplace of settlement some of them even perished utterly; amid the \rchanging fortunes of all of them deeds were performed that fixed \rthemselves in the memory of the whole people, great victories or I \rgreat disasters became the subject of story and song. We need \xc2\xa5 \ronly to recall such names as those of Ermanric and Theodoric \rto remind ourselves what an important part was played by the \rGermanic peoples of that Migration Period in the history of Europe. \rDuring it a national consciousness was engendered, and in it we \rhave the faint beginnings of a national literature. Germanic saga \rrests almost entirely upon the events of these two centuries, the \rfifth and sixth. Although we get glimpses of the Germans during \rthe four or five preceding centuries, none of the historic characters \rof those earlier times have been preserved in the national sagas. \r\rWith these sagas based on history, however, have been mingled \r\rvii \r\r\r\rvia \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\r\r\rin most cases primeval Germanic myths, possessions of the people \rfrom prehistoric times. A most conspicuous example of this union \rof mythical and originally historical elements is the Nibelungen \rsaga, out of which grew in course of time the great national epic, \rthe Nibelungenlied. \r\r! The Nibelungen saga is made up of two parts, on the one hand \rthe mythical story of Siegfried and on the other the story, founded \ron historic fact, of the Burgundians. When and how the Siegfried \rmyth arose it is impossible to say; its origin takes us back into \rthe impenetrable mists of the unrecorded life of our Germanic \rforefathers, and its form was moulded by the popular poetic spirit. \rThe other part of the saga is based upon the historic incident of \rthe overthrow of the Burgundian kingdom by the Huns in the \ryear 437. This annihilation of a whole tribe naturally impressed \ritself vividly upon the imagination of contemporaries. Then the \rfact of history soon began to pass over into the realm of legend, \rand, from causes which can no longer be determined, this tradition \rof the vanished Burgundians became united with the mythical \rstory of Siegfried. This composite Siegfried-Burgundian saga \rthen became a common possession of the Germanic peoples, was \rborne with many of them to lands far distant from the place of \rits origin, and was further moulded by each according to its pecu- \rliar genius and surroundings. In the Icelandic Eddas, the oldest \rof which we have as they were written down in the latter part of \rthe ninth century, are preserved the earliest records of the form \rit had taken among the northern Germanic peoples. Our Nibe- \rlungenlied, which is the chief source of our knowledge of the story \ras it developed in Germany, dates from about the year 1200. These \rtwo versions, the Northern and the German, though originating \rin this common source, had diverged very widely in the centuries \rthat elapsed between their beginning and the time when the manu- \rscripts were written in which they are preserved. Each curtailed, \rre-arranged, or enlarged the incidents of the story in its own way. \rThe character of the chief actors and the motives underlying what \rwe may call the dramatic development assumed widely dissimilar \rforms. The German Nibelungenlied may be read and appreciated \ras one of the world\'s great epic poems without an acquaintance \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGEN SAGA ix \r\ron the part of the reader with the Northern version of the saga. In \rorder, however, to furnish the setting for a few episodes that would \rin that case remain either obscure or colorless, and with a view to \rplacing the readers of this translation in a position to judge better \rthe deeper significance of the epic as the eloquent narrative of a \rthousand years of the life of the people among whom it grew, the \rbroad outlines of the saga in its Northern form will be given here. \r\r2. The Northern Form of the Saga \r\rStarting at the middle of the fifth century from the territory \rabout Worms on the Rhine where the Burgundians were over- \rthrown, the saga soon spread from the Franks to the other Germanic \rpeoples. We have evidence of its presence in northern Germany \rand Denmark. Allusions to it in the Anglo-Saxon poem, the \rWanderer, of the seventh century and in the great Anglo-Saxon \repic Beowulf of a short time later, show us that it had early become \rpart of the national saga stock in England. Among the people \rof Norway and Iceland it took root and grew with particular vigor. \rHere, farthest away from its original home and least exposed to \routward influences, it preserved on the whole most fully its heathen \rGermanic character, especially in its mythical part. By a fortu- \rnate turn of events, too, the written record of it here is of consider- \rably earlier date than that which we have from Germany. The \rEddas, as the extensive collection of early Icelandic poems is called, \rare the fullest record of Germanic mythology and saga that has \rbeen handed down to us, and in them the saga of Siegfried and \rthe Nibelungen looms up prominently. The earliest of these \rpoems date from about the year 850, and the most important of \rthem were probably written down within a couple of centuries of \rthat time. They are thus in part some three centuries older than \rthe German Nibelungenlied, and on the whole, too, they preserve \rmore of the original outlines of the saga. By bringing together \rthe various episodes of the saga from the Eddas and the Volsung \rsaga, a prose account of the mythical race of the Volsungs, we arrive \rat the following narrative. \r\rOn their wanderings through the world the three gods Odin, \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\r\r\rHonir, and Loki come to a waterfall where an otter is devouring \ra fish that it has caught. Loki kills the otter with a stone, and \rthey take off its skin. In the evening they seek a lodging at the \rhouse of Hreidmar, to whom they show the skin. Hreidmar recog- \rnizes it as that of his son, whom Loki has killed when he had taken \ron the form of an otter. Assisted by his sons Fafnir and Regin, \rHreidmar seizes the three gods, and spares their lives only on the \rpromise that they will fill the skin, and also cover it outwardly, \rwith gold. Loki is sent to procure the ransom. With a net bor- \rrowed from the sea-goddess Ran he catches at the waterfall the \rdwarf Andvari in form of a fish and compels him to supply the \rrequired gold. Andvari tries to keep back a ring, but this also \rLoki takes from him, whereupon the dwarf utters a curse upon \rthe gold and whosoever may possess it. The ransom is now paid \rto Hreidmar; even the ring must, on Hreidmar\'s demand, be given \rin order to complete the covering of the otter\'s skin. Loki tells \rhim of the curse connected with the ownership of the gold. When \rHreidmar refuses Fafnir and Regin a share in the treasure, he is \rkilled by Fafnir, who takes possession of the hoard to the exclusion \rof Regin. In the form of a dragon Fafnir dwells on Gnita Heath \rguarding the hoard, while Regin broods revenge. \r\rFrom Odin is descended King Volsung, who has a family of \rten sons and one daughter. The eldest son is Sigmund, twin- \rborn with his sister Signy. King Siggeir of Gautland sues for \rthe hand of Signy, whom her father gives to Siggeir against her \rwill. In the midst of King Volsung\'s hall stood a mighty oak- \rtree. As the wedding-feast is being held there enters a stranger, \ran old man with one eye, his hat drawn down over his face and \rbearing in his hand a sword. This sword he thrusts to the hilt \rinto the tree, saying that it shall belong to him who can draw it \rout again; after which he disappears as he had come. AH the \rguests try their strength in vain upon the sword, but Sigmund \ralone is able to draw it forth. He refuses to sell it to Siggeir for \rall his proffered gold. Siggeir plans vengeance. He invites Vol- \rsung and his sons to Gautland, and returns home thither with \rhis bride Signy, who before going warns her father to be upon \rhis guard. \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGEN SAGA xi \r\r\r\rAt the appointed time King Volsung and his sons go as invited \rto Gautland. In spite of Signy\'s repeated warning he will not \rflee from danger, and falls in combat with Siggeir; his ten sons \rare taken prisoners, and placed in stocks in the forest. For nine \rsuccessive nights a she-wolf comes and devours each night one of \rthem, till only Sigmund remains. By the aid of Signy he escapes. \rThe she-wolf, it was said, was the mother of Siggeir. \r\rTo Sigmund, who has hidden in a wood, Signy sends her eldest \rboy of ten years that Sigmund may test his courage and see if he is \rfit to be a helper in seeking revenge. Neither he, however, nor \rhis younger brother stands the test. Signy sees that only a scion \rof the race of Volsung will suffice, and accordingly disguises her- \rself and lives three days with Sigmund in the wood. From their \runion a son Sinfiotli is born, whom also, after ten years, she sends \rout to Sigmund. He stands every test of courage, and is trained \rby Sigmund, who thinks he is Siggeir\'s son. \r\rBent on revenge, Sigmund repairs with Sinfiotli to Siggeir\'s \rcastle. After Sinfiotli has slain the king\'s two sons, he and Sig- \rmund are overpowered and condemned to be buried alive. With \rSigmund\'s sword, however, which Signy has managed to place \rin their hands, they cut their way out, then set fire to Siggeir\'s hall. \rSigny comes forth and reveals to Sigmund that Sinfiotli is their \rown son; and then,\' saying that her work of revenge is complete \rand that she can live no longer, she returns into the burning hall \rand perishes with Siggeir and all his race. \r\rSigmund now returns home and rules as a mighty king. He \rmarries Borghild, who later kills Sinfiotli with a poisoned drink, \rand is cast away by Sigmund. He then marries Hjordis. Lyngvi, \rthe son of King Hunding, was also a suitor and now invades Sig- \rmund\'s land. The latter hews down many of his enemies, until \ran old man with one eye, in hat and dark cloak, interposes his \rspear, against which Sigmund\'s sword breaks in two. Sigmund \rfalls severely wounded. \r\rIn the night Hjordis seeks the scene of the combat and finds \rSigmund still alive. He refuses -to allow her to heal his wounds, \rsaying that Odin no longer wills that he swing the sword. He \rtells Hjordis to preserve carefully the pieces of the broken sword; \r\r\r\rxii THE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\r\r\rthe son she bears in her womb shall yet swing the sword when \rwelded anew, and win thereby a glorious name. At dawn Sig- \rmund dies. Hjordis is borne off by Vikings and, after the birth of \rher son, she becomes the wife of the Danish prince Alf. \r\rThe son of Hjordis was called Sigurd. He grew up a boy of \rwondrous strength and beauty, with eyes that sparkled brightly, \rand lived at the court of King Hjalprek, the father of Alf. Regin, \rthe dwarfish brother of Fafnir, was his tutor. Regin welds together \rthe pieces of the broken sword Gram, so sharp and strong that with \rit Sigurd cleaves Regin\'s anvil in twain. With men and ships that \rhe has received from King Hjalprek Sigurd goes against the sons \rof Hunding, whom he slays, thereby avenging the death of his \rfather. Regin has urged him to kill Fafnir and take possession of \rthe hoard. On the Gnita Heath he digs a ditch from which, as \rthe dragon Fafnir passes over it, he plunges the sword into his \rheart. The dying Fafnir warns him of the curse attached to the \rpossession of the gold; also that Regin is to be guarded against. \rThe latter bids him roast the heart of Fafnir. While doing so he \rburns his finger by dipping it in the blood to see if the heart is done, \rand to cool his finger puts it into his mouth. Suddenly he is able to \runderstand the language of the birds in the wood. They warn \rhim to beware of Regin, whom he straightway slays. The birds \rtell him further of the beautiful valkyrie Brynhild, who sleeps on the \rfire-encircled mountain awaiting her deliverer. Then Sigurd places \rFafnir\'s hoard upon his steed Grani, takes with him also Fafnir\'s \rhelm, and rides away to Frankenland. He sees a mountain en- \rcircled by a zone of fire, makes his way into it and beholds there, \ras he deems it, a man in full armor asleep. When he takes off the \rhelmet he finds that it is a woman. With his sword he cuts loose \rthe armor. The woman wakes and asks if it be the hero Sigurd \rwho has awakened her. In joy that it is so, Brynhild relates to \rhim how Odin had punished her by this magic sleep for disobedi- \rence, and how that she had yet obtained from him the promise \rthat she should be wakened only by a hero who knew no fear. \rShe now teaches Sigurd many wise runes, and tells him of harm \rto fear through love of her. In spite of all, however, Sigurd does \rnot waver, and they swear an oath of mutual faithful love. \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGEN SAGA xiii \r\r\r\rNext Sigurd comes to King Gjuki at the Rhine, and joins in \rfriendship with him and his sons Gunnar and Hogni. Queen \rGrimhild gives Sigurd a potion which causes him to forget Brynhild \rand be filled with love for her own daughter Gudrun, whom he \rmarries. Gunnar now seeks Brynhild for wife, and Sigurd goes \rwith him on his wooing-journey. They come to the castle encircled \rby fire, where Brynhild lives. She will be wooed only by him who \rwill ride to her through the flames. Gunnar tries in vain to do this, \reven when mounted on Sigurd\'s steed Grani. Sigurd and Gunnar \rthen exchange shapes and the former spurs Grani through the \rflames. He calls himself Gunnar the son of Gjuki, and finally \rBrynhild consents to become his wife. Three nights he shares \rher couch, but always his sharp sword lies between them. He \rtakes the ring from her finger and places in its stead one from \rFafnir\'s treasure. Then he exchanges form again with Gunnar, \rwho is soon after wedded to Brynhild. Only now does Sigurd \rrecollect the oath that he once swore to Brynhild himself. \r\rOne day Brynhild and Gudrun are bathing in the Rhine. A \rquarrel arises between them when Brynhild takes precedence of \rGudrun by going into the water above her in the stream, saying \rthat her husband is a braver and mightier man than Gudrun\'s. \rGudrun retorts by revealing the secret that it was Sigurd in Gun- \rnar\'s form, and not Gunnar himself, who rode through the flame, \rand in proof thereof shows her the ring taken by Sigurd from Bryn- \rhild\'s finger. Pale as death, Brynhild goes quietly home: Gun- \rnar must die, she says in wrath. Sigurd tries to pacify her, even \roffering to desert Gudrun. Now she will have neither him nor \ranother, and when Gunnar appears she demands of him Sigurd\'s \rdeath. In spite of Hogni\'s protest Gunnar\'s stepbrother Gut- \rthorm, who has not sworn blood-friendship with Sigurd, is got to \rdo the deed. He is given the flesh of wolf and serpent to eat in \rorder to make him savage. Twice Gutthorm goes to kill Sigurd, \rbut cowers before the piercing glance of his eyes; at last he steals \rupon Sigurd asleep and thrusts his sword through him. The dying \rSigurd hurls the sword after the fleeing murderer and cuts him in \rtwo. To Gudrun, who wakes from sleep by his side, he points to ; \rBrynhild as the instigator of the crime, and dies. Brynhild rejoices \r\r\r\rxiv THE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\rat the sound of Gudrun\'s wailing. Gudrun cannot find relief \rfor her grief, the tears will not flow. Men and women seek to con- \rsole her by tales of greater woes befallen them. But still Gudrun \rcannot weep as she sits by Sigurd\'s corpse. At last one of the \rwomen lifts the cloth from Sigurd\'s face and lays his head upon \rGudrun\'s lap. Then Gudrun gazes on his blood-besmirched hair, \rhis dimmed eyes, and breast pierced by the sword: she sinks down \rupon the couch and a flood of tears bursts at length from her eyes. \r\rBrynhild now tells Gunnar that Sigurd had really kept faith \rwith him on the wooing-journey; but she will live with him no \rlonger and pierces herself with a sword, after foretelling to Gunnar \rhis future fate and that of Gudrun. In accord with her own \rrequest she is burned on one funeral-pyre with Sigurd, the sword \rbetween them as once before. \r\rAtli, * king of the Huns, now seeks Gudrun for wife. She \rrefuses, but Grimhild gives her a potion which causes her to forget \rSigurd and the past, and then she becomes the wife of Atli. After \rSigurd\'s death Gunnar had taken possession of the Niflungen \rhoard, and this Atli now covets. He treacherously invites Gunnar \rand the others to visit him, which they do in spite of Gudrun\'s \rwarnings, first of all, however, sinking the hoard in the Rhine. \rOn their arrival Atli demands of them the hoard, which, he says, \rbelongs of right to Gudrun. On their refusal he attacks them. \rHosts of fighters on both sides fall and in the end Gunnar and \rHogni, the only two of their number remaining, are bound in fetters. \rGunnar refuses Atli\'s command to reveal the hiding-place of the \rhoard, bidding them bring to him the heart of Hogni. They kill \ra servant and bring his heart to Gunnar; but Gunnar sees how it \rstill quivers with fear, and knows it is not the heart of the fearless \rHogni. Then the latter is really killed, and his heart is brought \rto Gunnar, who cries exultingly that now only the Rhine knows \rwhere the hoard lies hidden. In spite of Gudrun Atli orders \rthat Gunnar be thrown into a den of serpents. With a harp com- \rmunicated to him by Gudrun he pacifies them all but one, which \rstings him to the heart, and thus Gunnar dies. Gudrun is nominally \r\r* That is, Attila; the Etzel of the Nibelungenlied. \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGEN SAGA xv \r\r\r\rreconciled with AtJi, but in secret plans revenge for the death of \rher brothers. She kills Atli\'s two sons, gives him at a banquet \rtheir blood to drink and their hearts to eat. In the night she plunges \ra sword into his own heart, confesses herself to him as his murderer, \rand sets fire to the castle, in which Atli and all his remaining men \rare consumed. \r\r3. The Saga as preserved in the Nibelungenlied \r\rThe saga as we find it in the German Nibelungenlied differs \rvery widely in form and substance from the Northern version \rwhich has just been outlined, though the two have still enough \rpoints of similarity to indicate clearly a common origin. Each \rbears the stamp of the poetic genius of the people among whom \rit grew. Of all the sagas of the Germanic peoples none holds \rso prominent a place as the Nibelungen saga, and it may safely \rbe said that the epic literature of the world, though offering poems \rof more refined literary worth, has none that are at the same time \rsuch valuable records of the growth of the poetic genius of two/ \rkindred peoples through many centuries of their early civilization \ras the Edda poems of this saga and the Nibelungenlied. It is! \rimpossible here to undertake a comparison of the two and point \rout in detail their parallelism and their respective significance as \rmonuments of civilization; suffice it to indicate briefly the chief \rpoints of difference in the two stories, and note particularly those \rparts of the Nibelungenlied that have, as it were, suffered atrophy, \rand that point to earlier stages of the saga in which, as in the Northern \rversion, they played a more important r61e. \r\rFirst, as to the hoard. The Nibelungenlied knows nothing of \rits being taken by Loki from Andvari, of the latter\'s curse upon \rit, and how it came finally into the possession of Fafnir, the giant- \rdragon. Here it belongs, as we learn from Hagen\'s account \r(strophes 86-99), to Siegfried (Sigurd), who has slain the previous \rowners of it, Schilbung and Nibelung, and wrested it from its \rguardian the dwarf Alberich (Andvari). From this point onward \rits history runs nearly parallel in the two versions. After Sieg- \rfried\'s death it remains for a time with Kriemhild (Gudrun), is \r\r\r\rxviii THE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\rsaga, and had already passed through a long period of develop- \rment before its union with the story of the Burgundian kings. \rLike so many others of its kind, it is part of the spiritual equipment \rof our Germanic ancestors at the dawn of their recorded history. \rIt grew gradually with the people themselves and has its counterpart \ramong other peoples. Such myths are a record of the impressions \rmade upon the mind of man by the mighty manifestations of the \rworld of nature in which he lives; their formation may be likened \rto the unconscious impressions of its surroundings on the mind \rof the child. And just as the grown man is unable to trace back \rthe formation of his own individuality to its very beginnings in \rinfancy, so is it impossible for the later nation in its advanced \rstage to peer back beyond the dawn of its history. It is in the \rgloom beyond the dawn that such myths as this of Siegfried have \rtheir origin. \r\rThough modern authorities differ greatly in their conjectures, \rit is generally agreed that the Siegfried story was in its original \rform a nature-myth. The young day slays the mist-dragon and \rawakens the sun-maiden that sleeps on the mountain; at evening \rhe falls a prey to the powers of gloom that draw the sun down again \rbeneath the earth. With this day-myth was probably combined \rthe parallel myth of the changing seasons: the light returns in \rspring, slays the cloud-dragon, and frees the budding earth from \rthe bonds of winter.* \r\rIn the course of time this nature-myth became transformed into \ra hero-saga; the liberating power of light was humanized into \rthe person of the light-hero Siegfried. This stage of development \rhad already been reached at the time of our earliest records, and \rthe evidences point to the Rhine Franks, a West Germanic tribe \rsettled in the fifth century in the country about Cologne, as the \rpeople among whom the transformation from nature-myth to hero- \rsaga took place, for it is among them that the saga in its earliest! \rform is localized.

By the Rhine, too, he enters into service with the Nibe- \rlungen kings and weds their sister. \r\rThe Franks had as neighbors up-stream in the first half of the \rfifth century the Burgundians, an East Germanic tribe. These \rBurgundians, who were closely allied to the Goths, had originally \rdwelt in the Baltic region between the Vistula and the Oder, whence \rthey had made their way southwestward across Germany and settled \rin the year 413 in Germania prima on the west bank of the Rhine \rabout Worms. Here a tragic fate was soon to overtake them. \rIn the year 435 they had already suffered a reverse in a conflict \rwith the Romans under Aetius, and two years later, in 437, they \rwere practically annihilated by the Huns. Twenty thousand of \rthem, we are told, fell in battle, the remainder were scattered south- \rward. Beyond the brief record by a contemporary, Prosper, we \rknow but little of this event. It has been conjectured that the \rHuns were on this occasion acting as auxiliaries of Aetius. At any \rrate it is fairly certain that Attila was not personally on the scene. * \rWe can easily imagine what a profound impression this extinc- \rtion of the Burgundians would produce upon the minds of their \rneighbors the Rhine Franks. Fact, too, would soon become mingled \rwith fiction. This new feat was ascribed to Attila himself, already \rtoo well known as the scourge of Europe and the subduer of so \rmany German tribes. A very few years later, however, fate was \rto subdue the mighty conqueror himself. With the great battle of \rChalons in 451 the tide turned against him, and two years after- \rwards he died a mysterious death. The historian Jordanes of the \rsixth century relates that on the morning after Attila\'s wedding \rwith a German princess named Ildico (Hildikd) he was found \rlying in bed in a pool of blood, having died of a hemorrhage. The \rmysteriousness of Attila\'s ending inspired his contemporaries with \rawe, and the popular fancy was not slow to clothe this event also in \ra dress of fiction. The attendant circumstances peculiarly favored \rsuch a process. Historians soon recorded the belief that Attila \rhad perished at the hands of his wife, and it was only a step fur- \rther for the imagination to find the motive for the deed in the desire \rof Hildiko to avenge the death of her German kinsmen who had \rpenshed through Attila. The saga of Attila\'s death is before long \r\r\r\rXX \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\r\r\rconnected with the growing Burgundian saga, Hildiko becomes \rthe sister of the Burgundian kings Gundahari, Godomar, and \rGislahari, and her deed is vengeance taken upon Attila for his \rdestruction of her brothers. As is seen at once from the outline I \rhave already given (pp. ix-xv) of the saga as we find it in the Edda, \rthis is the stage of development it had reached when it began to \rfind its way northward from the Rhine country to Norway and \r\rIceland. \r\rIt is unnecessary here to record the speculations\xc3\x91 for beyond \rspeculations we cannot go-as to how the union of this historical \rsaga of the Burgundians and Attila with the Siegfried saga took \rplace In the course of time, and naturally with greatest prob- \rability among the Rhine Franks who followed the Burgundians \ras occupants of Germania prima, the two were brought together, \rand the three Burgundian kings and their sister were identified \rwith the three Nibelungen kings and their sister of the already \rlocalized Siegfried saga. It is also beyond the scope of this intro- \rduction to follow the course of the saga northward or to note its \rfurther evolution during its wanderings and in its new home until \rit was finally recorded in poetic form in the Edda. We have now \rto consider briefly the transformation it passed through in Ger- \rmany between this date (about 500) and the time (about 1200) \rwhen it emerges in written record as the Nibelungenlied. \r\rAn account has already been given (pp. xv-xvii) of the chief \rfeatures in which the Nibelungenlied differs from the Northern \rform. As we saw there, the mythical element of the Siegfried saga \rhas almost entirely evaporated and the historical saga of the Bur- \rgundian kings and Attila has undergone a complete transformation \rThat the originally mythical and heathen Siegfried saga should \rdwindle away with the progress of civilization and under the influ- \rence of Christianity was but natural. The character of the val- \rkyrie Brynhild who avenges upon Sigurd his infidelity to her, yet \rvoluntarily unites herself with him in death, as heathen custom \rdemanded, is no longer intelligible. She recedes into the back- \rground, and after Siegfried\'s death, though she is still living, she \rplays no further part. The Nibelungenlied found its final form \ron Upper German, doubtless Austrian, territory. Here alone was it \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGEN SAGA \r\r\r\rxxi \r\r\r\rpossible that that greatest of all transformations could take place, \rnamely, in the character of Attila. The Franks of the Rhine knew \rhim only as the awe-inspiring conqueror who had annihilated their \rneighbors the Burgundians. In Austrian lands it Ivas quite other- \rwise. Many Germanic tribes, particularly the East Goths, had \rfought under the banner of Attila, and in the tradition handed \rdown from them he lived as the embodiment of wisdom and gener- \rosity. Here it was impossible that epic story should picture him \ras slaying the Burgundian kings through a covetous desire for their \rgold. The annihilation of the Burgundians is thus left without a \rmotive. To supply this, Kriemhild\'s character is placed upon an \rentirely different basis. Instead of avenging upon Attila the death \rof her brothers the Burgundian kings, Kriemhild now avenges upon \rher brothers the slaying of her first husband Siegfried. This funda- \rmental change in the character of Kriemhild has a deep ethical \rreason. To the ancient heathen Germans the tie of blood-relation- \rship was stronger than that of wedlock, and thus in the original \rversion of the story Attila\'s wife avenges upon him the death of \rher brothers; to the Christianized Germans of later times the mar- \rriage bond was the stronger, and accordingly from the altered \rmotive Kriemhild avenges upon her brothers the slaying of her \rhusband. In accordance, too, with this ethical transformation the \rscene of the catastrophe is transferred from Worms to Attila\'s court. \rKriemhild now looms up as the central figure of the second half of \rthe drama, while Etzel remains to the last ignorant of her designs \rfor revenge. \r\rThis transformation of the fundamental parts of the saga was \raccompanied by another process, namely, the addition of new \rcharacters. Some of these are the product of the poetic faculty \rof the people or individuals who preserved and remoulded the \rstory in the course of centuries, others are based upon history. \rTo the former class belong the Margrave Ruediger, the ideal of \rgentle chivalry, and Volker the Fiddler-knight, doubtless a creation \rof the spielleule. To the second class belong Dietrich of Bern, \rin whom we see the mighty East Gothic king, Theodoric of Verona; \ralso Bishop Pilgrim of Passau, a very late importation, besides \r? \'hom are perpetuated in more or less faint out- \r\r\r\r3fo1 ^4-U. \r\r\r\rxxn \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\r\r\rline actual persons of history. This introduction of fresh characters \rfrom time to time as the saga grew has led to some strange \ranachronisms, which however are a disturbing element only to \rus readers of a fnodern day, who with sacrilegious hand lift the veil \rthrough which they were seen in a uniform haze of romance by \rthe eye of the knights and ladies of seven centuries ago. They \rneither knew nor cared to know, for instance, that Attila was dead \rbefore Theodoric was born, and that Bishop Pilgrim flourished \rat Passau the trifling space of five hundred years later still.* \r\rII. THE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\ri. The Manuscripts \r\rAmong the German epic poems of the Middle Ages the \rNibelungenlied f enjoyed an exceptional popularity, as is evident \rfrom the large number of manuscripts\xc3\x91 some thirty, either com- \rplete or fragmentary\xc3\x91 that have been preserved from the centuries \rimmediately following its appearance. Three are of prime impor- \rtance as texts, namely, those preserved now in Munich, St. Gall, \rand Donaueschingen, and cited as A, B, and C respectively. Since \rthe time when Lachmann, about a century ago, made the first \rscientific study of the poem, a whole flood of writings has been \rpoured forth discussing the relative merits of these texts. Each in \r\r* Attila lived from about 406 to 453; Theodoric, 475 to 526. Pil- \rgrim was Bishop of Passau, 971 to 991. , .... , ... _ \r\rt The closing strophe of MS. C calls the poem der Nibehingehet, or \rNibelungenlied, i.e. the lay of the Nibelungen, and this is the title by \rwhich it is commonly known. MSS. A and B have in the correspond- \ring strophe derNibelunge nSt,\'i.e. the \'need\', \'distress , downfall of \rtht Nibelungen. In the title of the poem Nibelungen is simply \requivalent to \' Burgundians \' : the poem relates the downfall of the \rBurgundian kings and their people. Originally the Nibelungen were, \ras their name, which is connected with nebel, \'mist \\ gloom signifies, \rthe powers of darkness to whom the light-hero Siegfried fell a prey. \rAfter Siegfried obtains possession of the treasure the name Nibel- \rungen is still applied to Alberich and the dwarfs who guard it and \rwho are now Siegfried\'s vassals. Then after Siegfried s death the \rname is given to the Burgundians. It is a mistake to suppose that \rthe name was applied in each case to those who became possessors \rof the hoard, for Siegfried himself is never so designated. \r\r\r\rTHE XIBELUXGEXLIED xxiii \r\r\r\rturn has had its claims advocated with warmth and even acrimony. \rNone of - three principal manuscripts, however, offers the \r\rpoem in its earliest form; they all point to a still earlier version. \rIt is : rurally admitted that the St. Gall manuscript (B), \r\raccording to which the present translation has been made, con- \rtains the best and most nearly original text. \r\r\r\r2. Stages est the Evolution of the Poem \r\rHand in hand with the discussion of the relative authenticity \rof the manuscripts went the consideration of another more impor- \rtant literary question, \xc3\x91 the evolution of the poem itself. Even \rif we knew nothing of the history of the Xibelungen saga as revealed \rin the Edda and through other literary and historic sources, a \rreading of the poem would give us unmistakable hints that it is \rnot, in its present form, a perfect literary unit. We detect incon- \rsistencies in matter and inequalities of style that prove it to be a \rremodelling of material already existing in some earlier form. \rWhat, then, ha., been the history of its evolution? How did this \rprimeval Siegfried myth, this historical saga of the Burgundians \rand Attila, first come to be part of the poetic stock of the German \rpeople? What was its earliest poetic form, and what series of \rtransformations did it pass through during seven centuries of growth ? \rThese and many kindred questions present themselves, and the \rsearch for answers to them takes us through many winding labyrinths \rof the nation\'s contemporary history. Few products of German \rliterature have so exercised and tantalized critics as the Xibelun^en- \rlied. \r\rIn this connection we have to remind ourselves that comparatively \rlittle of what must have been the large body of native poetry in Ger- \rmany previous to the eleventh century has come down to us. Barely \renough has been preserved to show the path of the nation\'s literary \rprogress. Some of the important monuments have been saved by \rchance, while others of equal or perhaps greater value have been \rirrecoverably lost. The interest in the various incidents of the \rXibelungen story was sufficient to keep it alive among the people \r\r\r\rxxiv THE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\r\r\rand hand it down orally through many generations. If we could \robserve it as it passed from age to age we should doubtless see it \rundergoing continuous change according to the time and the class \rof the people that were the preservers of the native literature in its \rmany ups and downs. Lachmann in the year 1816 was the first to \rbring scientific criticism to bear on the question of the Nibelungenlied \rand its origin. Applying to it the same methods as had recently \rbeen used by Wolf in his criticism of the Homeric poems, he thought \rhe was able to discover as the basis of the complete epic a cycle \rof twenty separate lieder, ballads or shorter episodic poems, on the \rstrength of which belief he went so far as to publish an edition of \rthe poem in which he made the division into the twenty separate \rlays and eliminated those strophes (more than one third of the \rwhole number) that he deemed not genuine. It is now generally \radmitted, however, that the pioneer of Nibelungen investigation \rfell here into over-positive refinements of literary criticism Sep- \rarate shorter poems there doubtless existed narrating separate \repisodes of the story, but these are no longer to be arrived at by a \rprocess of critical disintegration and pruning of the epic as we \rhave it. An examination of the twenty lieder according to Lach- \rmann\'s division convinces us that they are not separate units in \rthe sense he conceived them to be. Though these twenty lieder \rmay be based upon a number of earlier episodic poems, yet the \rlatter already constituted a connected series. They were already \rlike so many scenes of a gradually developing drama. Events were \rforeshadowed in one that were only fulfilled in another, and the \rincidents of later ones are often only intelligible on the supposition \rof an acquaintance with motives that originated in preceding ones. \rIt is in this sense only, not according to Lachmann\'s overwrought \rtheory, that we are justified in speaking of a liedercyclus , or cycle \rof separate episodic poems, as the stage of the epic antecedent to \rthe complete form in which we now have it. But beyond this \rcycle we cannot trace it back. How the mythical saga of Siegfried \rand the Nibelungen, and the story of the Burgundians and Attila, \rwere first sung in alliterative lays in the Migration Period, how as \rheathen song they were pushed aside or slowly influenced by the \rspirit of Christianity, how with changing time they changed also \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED xxv \r\rtheir outward poetical garb from alliteration to rhyme and altered \rverse-form, till at last in the twelfth century they have become \rthe cycle of poems from which the great epic of the Nibelungen- \rlied could be constructed \xc3\x91 of all this we may form a faint picture \rfrom the development of the literature in general, but direct written \rrecord of it is almost completely wanting. \r\r3. Character of the Poem \r\rThe twelfth and thirteenth centuries witnessed far-reaching \rchanges in the social and intellectual life of the German lands, \rthe leading feature of which is the high development of all that \ris included under the name of_chjyalry . It is marked, too, by a \rrevival of the native literature such as had not been known before, \ra revival which is due almost entirely to its cultivation by the nobility. \rFrom emperor down to the simple knight they were patrons of \rpoetry and, what is most striking, nearly all the poets themselves \rbelong to the knightly class. The drama has not yet begun, but in \rthe field of epic and lyric there appear about the year 1200 poets \rwho are among the greatest that German literature even down to \rthe present time has to show. The epic poetry of that period, \rthough written almost entirely by the knights, is of two distinct \rkinds according to its subject: on the one hand what is called the \rCourt Epic, on the other hand the National, or Popular, Epic. The \rCourt Epic follows for the .most part French models and deals \rchiefly with the fife of chivalry, whose ideals were embodied in king \rArthur and his circle of knights; the National Epic drew its sub- \rjects from the national German saga, its two great products being \rthe Nibelungenlied and the poem of Gudrun. Court Epic and \rNational Epic are further distinct in form, the Court Epic being \rwritten in the rhymed couplets popularized in modern times in \rEnglish by Sir Walter Scott, while the National Epic is composed \rin four-lined strophes. \r\rThough we know the name and more or less of the life of the \rauthors of the many court epics of the period, the name of the poet \rwho gave the Nibelungenlied its final form has not been recorded. \rAs we have seen, the poem is at bottom of a truly popular, national \r\r\r\rXXVI \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\r\r\rcharacter, having its beginnings in mythology and early national \rhistory. For centuries the subject had been national property \rand connected with the name of no one individual. We have it \rnow in the form in which it was remodelled to suit the taste of the \rcourt and the nobility, and like the court epic to be read aloud in \rcastle hall. That it is written in four-lined strophes * and not in \rthe usual rhymed couplets of the court epics is doubtless due to the \rfact that the former verse-form had already been used in the earlier \rballads upon which it is based, and was simply taken over by the \rfinal moulder of the poem. This latter was probably a member \rof the nobility like the great majority of the epic poets of the time; \rhe must at least have been well acquainted with the manners, tastes, \rsentiments, and general life of the nobility. Through him the \rpoem was brought outwardly more into line with the literary ideals \rof the court circles. This shows itself chiefly in a negative way, \rnamely, in the almost complete avoidance of the coarse language \rand farcical situations so common with the popular poet, the spiel- \rmann. Beyond this no violence is done to the simple form of the \roriginal. The style is still inornate and direct, facts still speak \rrather than words, and there is nothing approaching the refined \rpsychological dissection of characters and motives such as we find \rin Wolfram von Eschenbach and the other court writers. \r\rWhen we look to the inner substance we see that the ground \rideals are still those of the original Germanic heroic age. The \rchief characters are still those of the first stages of the story\xc3\x91 Sieg- \rfried, Brunhild, Gunther, Kriemhild, Hagen. The fundamental \rtheme is the ancient theme of triuwe, unswerving personal loyalty \' \rand devotion, which manifests itself above all in the characters , \rof Kriemhild and Hagen. Kriemhild\'s husband Siegfried is \rtreacherously slain: her sorrow and revenge are the motives of \rthe drama. Hagen\'s mistress has, though with no evil intent on \rSiegfried\'s part, received an insult to her honor: to avenge that \rinsult is Hagen\'s absorbing duty, which he fulfils with an utter ^ \rdisregard of consequences. Over this their fundamental character \' \rthe various persons of the story have received a gloss of outward \r\r* For description of the Nibelungen strophe see below, p. xxxiv. \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED xxvii \r\rconduct in keeping with the close of the twelfth century. The \rpoet is at pains to picture them as models of courtly bearing, excel- \rling in hofscheit, zuht, tugent. Great attention is paid to dress, \rand the preparation of fitting apparel for court festivities is described \rand re-described with wearisome prolixity. A cardinal virtue is \rmilte, liberality in the bestowal of gifts. Courtesy toward women \ris observed with the careful formality of the age of the minnesingers. \rIt was above all Siegfried, the light-hero of the original myth, whose * \rcharacter lent itself to an idealization of knighthood. Ruediger \rholds a like place in the latter part of the poem. In the evident \rpleasure with which the minstrel-knight Volker of the sword- \rfiddlebow is depicted, as well doubtless as in occasional gleams of \rbroader humor, the hand of the minstrels who wrought on the \rstory in its earlier ballad stages may be seen. And the whole poem, \rin keeping with its form in an age strongly under church influence, \rhas been tinged with the ideals of Christianity. Not only does the \rordinary conversation of all the characters, including even the \rheathen Etzel, contain a great number of formal imprecations \rof God, but Christian institutions and Christian ethics come fre- \rquently into play. Mass is sung in the minster, baptism, marriage, \rburial are celebrated in Christian fashion, the devil is mentioned \raccording to the Christian conception, we hear of priest, chaplain, \rand bishop, Christians are contrasted with heathen, and Kriemhild, \rin marrying Etzel, has a hope of turning him to Christianity. In \rHagen\'s attempt to drown the chaplain whom the Burgundians \rhave with them as they set out for the land of the Huns we have \rperhaps an expression of the conflict between the heathen and \rthe Christian elements, possibly also a reflection of the traditional \ranimosity of the spielmann to his clerical rival. \r\rThe Nibelungenlied and the Iliad of Homer have often been \rcompared, but after all to no great puipose. The two epics are \ralike iij having their roots deep in national origins, but beyond \rthis we\' have contrasts rather than resemblances. The Iliad is \ra more varied and complete picture of the whole Greek world \rthan the Nibelungenlied is of the German, its religious atmosphere \rhas not been disturbed in the same way as that of the saga of early \rGermanic times projected several centuries into a later Christian \r\r\r\rxxviii THE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\r\r\rage, and it possesses in every way a greater unity of sentiment. \rIn the varied beauty of its language, its wealth of imagery, its depth \rof feeling and copiousness of incident the Iliad is superior to the \rNibelungenlied with its language of simple directness, its few \rlyrical passages, its expression of feeling by deeds rather than by \rwords. Homer, too, is in general buoyant, the Nibelungenlied is \rsombre and stern. And in one last respect the two epics differ \rmost of all: the Iliad is essentially narrative and descriptive, a \rseries of episodes; the Nibelungenlied is essentially dramatic, \rscene following scene of dramatic necessity and pointing steadily \rto a final and inevitable catastrophe. \r\r4. Later Forms oe the Saga \r\rIn the Northern Edda and in the German Nibelungenlied the \rNibelungen saga found its fullest and most poetic expression. But \rthese were not to be the only literary records of it. Both in Scandi- \rnavian lands and in Germany various other monuments, scattered \rover the intervening centuries, bear witness to the fact that it lived \ron in more or less divergent forms. The Danish historian Saxo \rGrammaticus of the latter part of the twelfth century has a reference \rto the story of Kriemhild\'s treachery toward her brothers. About \rthe year 1250 an extensive prose narrative, known as the Thidreks- \rsaga, was written by a Norwegian from oral accounts given him \rby men from Bremen and Minister. This narrative is interesting \ras showing the form the saga had taken by that date on Low Ger- \rman territory, and holds an important place in the history of the \rdevelopment of the saga. It has much more to say of the early \rhistory of Siegfried than we find in the Nibelungenlied, and yet \rin the main outlines of the story of Kriemhild\'s revenge it corre- \rsponds with the German epic and not with the Northern Edda. \rA chronicle of the island of Hven in the Sound, dating in its original \rform from the sixteenth century, as well as Danish ballads on the \rsame island that have lived on into modern times, tell of Sivard \r(Siegfried), Brynhild, and also of Grimild\'s (Kriemhild\'s) revenge. \rIn Norway and Sweden traces of the saga have recently been dis- \rcovered; while songs that are sung on the Faroe Islands, as an \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED xxix \r\r\r\raccompaniment to the dance on festive occasions, have been \rrecorded, containing over six hundred strophes in which is related \rin more or less distorted form the Nibelungen story. \r\rIn Germany the two poems known as the Klage and Hitmen \rSeyjrid are the most noteworthy additional records of the Nibelun- \rgen saga, as offering in part at least independent material. The \rKlage is a poem of over four thousand lines in rhymed couplets, \rabout half of it being an account of the mourning of Etzel, Diet- \rrich, and Hildebrand as they seek out the slain and prepare them \rfor burial, the other half telling of the bringing of the news to Bech- \relaren, Passau, and Worms. The poem was written evidently \rvery soon after the Nibelungenlied, the substance of which was \rfamiliar to the author, though he also draws in part from other \rsources. Compared with the Nibelungenlied it possesses but little \rpoetic merit and is written with distinctly Christian sentiment \rwhich is out of harmony with the ground-tone of the Germanic \rtragedy. \r\rThe Hiirnen Seyjrid is a poem of 179 four-lined strophes which \ris preserved only in a print of the sixteenth century, but at least \ra portion of whose substance reaches back in its original form to a \rperiod preceding the composition of the Nibelungenlied. It is \revidently, as we have it, formed by the union of two earlier separate \rpoems, which are indeed to a certain extent contradictory of each \rother. The first tells of the boyhood of Seyfrid (Siegfried) and his \rapprenticeship to the smith; how he slew many dragons, burned \rthem, and smeared over his body with the resulting fluid horny \rsubstance (hence his name hiirnen), which made him invulnerable; \rhow he further found the hoard of the dwarf Nybling, and by ser- \rvice to King Gybich won the latter\'s daughter for his wife. The \rsecond part tells how King Gybich reigned at Worms. He has \rthree sons, Giinther, Hagen, Gyrnot, and one daughter, Kriemhild. \rThe latter is borne off by a dragon, but finally rescued by Seyfrid, \rto whom she is given in marriage. The three brothers are jealous \rof the might and fame of Seyfrid, and after eight years Hagen \rslays him beside a cool spring in the Ottenwald. \r\rThe poem Biterolf, written soon after the Nibelungenlied, and \rRosengarten of perhaps a half-century later, represent Dietrich in \r\r\r\rxxx THE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\r\r\rconflict with Siegfried at Worms. The famous shoemaker-poet \rHans Sachs of Nuremberg in 1557 constructed a tragedy, Der hornen \rSewjriedt, on the story of Siegfried as he knew it from the Humeri \rSeyjrid and the Rosengarten. A prose version of the Htimen Seyjrid, \rwith free additions and alterations, is preserved in the Volksbuch \rvom gehornten Sigfrid, the oldest print of which dates from the \ryear 1726. Of the vast number of Fairy Tales, those most genu- \rine creations of the poetic imagination of the people, in which live \ron, often to be sure in scarcely recognizable form, many of the \rmyths and sagas of the nation\'s infancy, there are several that may \rwith justice be taken as relics of the Siegfried myth, for instance, \rThe Two Brothers, The Young Giant, The Earth-Manikin, The \rKing of the Golden Mount, The Raven, The Skilled Huntsman, \rand perhaps also the Golden Bird and The Water of Life; * though \rit would seem from recent investigations that Thorn-Rose or the \rSleeping Beauty, is no longer to be looked upon as the counter- \rpart of the sleeping Brynhild. Finally, it is probable that several \rnames in Germany and in Northern countries preserve localized \rmemories of the saga. \r\r5. Poem and Saga in Modern Literature \r\rFundamentally different from the foregoing natural outgrowths \rof the Nibelungen saga are the modern dramas and poems founded \rupon it since the time of the romanticists at the beginning of the \rnineteenth century .f Nearly all of these have already vanished \ras so much chaff from the winnowing-mill of time: only two, per- \rhaps, are now considered seriously, namely, Hebbel\'s Die Nibelungen \rand Richard Wagner\'s Ring des Nibelungen. Hebbel in his grandly \rconceived drama in three parts follows closely the story as we have \rit in our epic poem the Nibelungenlied, and the skill with which \rhe makes use of its tragic elements shows his dramatic genius at \rits best. But not even the genius of Hebbel could make these \r\r* These will be found in Grimm\'s Marchen as numbers 6o, 90-93, \rin, 57, and 97. \r\rt The curious will find a list of these in the introduction to Piper s \redition, cited below, p. xxxvi. \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED xxxi \r\r\r\rforms of myth and saga live again for us upon a modern stage, \rand the failure of this work with its wealth of poetic beauty and \rmany scenes of highest dramatic effectiveness to maintain its \rplace as an acting drama is sufficient evidence that the yawning \rgap that separates the sentiment of the modern world from that \rof the early centuries in which these sagas grew is not to be bridged \rover by the drama, however easy and indeed delightful it may be \rfor us to allow ourselves to be transported thither to that romantic \rland upon the wings of epic story. Wagner in his music-drama \rin three parts and prelude has followed in the main the saga in \rits Northern form* up to the death of Siegfried and Brunhild, \rbut to the entire exclusion of the latter part of the story in which \rAtli (Etzel) figures; his work has accordingly hardly any connec- \rtion with the Nibelungenlied here offered in translation. Only \rthe pious loyalty of national sentiment can assign a high place in \rdramatic literature to Wagner\'s work with its intended imitation \rof the alliterative form of verse; while his philosophizing gods \rand goddesses are also but decadent modern representatives of \rtheir rugged heathen originals. \r\r\r\r6. Modern German Translations \r\rThe language of the Nibelungenlied presents about the same \rdifficulty to the German reader of to-day as that of our English \rChaucer to us. Many translations into modern German have \raccordingly been made to render it accessible to the average reader \rwithout special study. In the year 1767 Bodmer in Zurich published \ra translation into hexameters of a portion of it, and since the inves- \rtigations of Lachmann raised it to the position of a national epic of \rfirst magnitude many more have appeared, both in prose and verse. \rThe best in prose is that by Scherr, of the year i860. Of the metrical \rtranslations that by Simrock, which in its later editions follows \rpretty closely the text of MS. C, is deservedly the most popular \rand has passed through a great number of editions. Bartsch \r\r* See above, pp. ix-xv. \r\r\r\rxxxii THE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\r\r\rhas also made a translation based on his edition of MS. B. These \rmodern versions by Simrock and Bartsch reproduce best the metrical \rquality of the original strophe. Easily obtainable recent trans- \rlations are those by Junghans (in Reclam\'s Universalbibliothek) \rof text C, and by Hahn (Collection Spemann) of text A. \r\r7. English Translations * \r\rEarly in last century interest in the Nibelungenlied began \rto manifest itself in England. A synopsis of it, with metrical \rtranslation of several strophes, appeared in the year 18 14 in Weber, \rJamieson and Scott\'s "Illustrations of Northern Antiquities" (Lon- \rdon and Edinburgh), in which, according to Lockhart, Sir Walter \rScott\'s hand, may perhaps be seen. Carlyle, laboring as a pioneer to \rspread a knowledge of German literature in England, contributed \rto the Westminster Review in 183 1 his well-known essay on the \rNibelungenlied which, though containing an additional mass of \rrather ill-arranged matter and now antiquated in many particulars, \ris still well worth reading for its enthusiastic account of the epic \ritself in the genuine style of the author. Carlyle here reproduces \rin metrical form a few strophes. He has said elsewhere that one \rof his ambitions was to make a complete English version of the \rpoem. Since then an endless number of accounts of it, chiefly \rworthless, has appeared in magazines and elsewhere. The first \rattempt at a complete metrical translation was made in 1848 by \rJonathan Birch, who however only reproduces Lachmann\'s twenty \rlit der, with some fifty-one strophes added on his own account. His \rversion of the first strophe runs thus: \r\rLegends of by-gone times reveal wonders and prodigies, \rOf heroes worthy endless fame, \xc3\x91 of matchless braveries, \xc3\x91 \rOf jubilees and festal sports, \xc3\x91 of tears and sorrows great, \xc3\x91 \rAnd knights who daring combats fought: \xc3\x91 the like I now relate, \r\rIn 1850 appeared William Nansom Lettsom\'s translation of the \r\r* For a complete list of these, also of magazine articles, etc., \rrelating to the Nibelungenlied, see F. E. Sandbach, The Nibelungen- \rlied and Gudrun in England and America, London, 1903. \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED xxxiii \r\r\r\rwhole poem according to Braunfels\' edition, with the opening \rstrophe turned as follows: \r\rIn stories of our fathers high marvels we are told \rOf champions well approved in perils manifold. \rOf feasts and merry meetings, of weeping and of wail, \rAnd deeds of gallant daring I\'ll tell you in my tale. \r\rThe next metrical rendering is that by A. G. Foster-Barham in \r\rthe year 1887. His first strophe reads: \r\rMany a wondrous story have the tales of old, \r\rOf feats of knightly glory, and of the Heroes bold, \r\rOf the delights of feasting, of weeping and of wail, \r\rOf noble deeds of daring; you may list strange things in my tale. \r\rIn the year 1898 follows still another, by Alice Horton (edited by \rE. Bell). This latest translation is based on Bartsch\'s text of \rMS. B, and is prefaced by Carlyle\'s essay. First strophe: \r\rTo us, in olden legends, is many a marvel told \r\rOf praise-deserving heroes, of labours manifold, \r\rOf weeping and of wailing, of joy and festival; \r\rOf bold knights\' battling shall you now hear a wondrous tale. \r\rApart from the many faults of interpretation all of the metrical \rtranslations of the Nibelungenlied here enumerated are defective \rin one all-important respect: they do not reproduce the poem in \rits metrical form. Carlyle and other pioneers we may perhaps \racquit of any intention of following the original closely in this regard. \rNone of the translators of the complete poem, however, has retained \rin the English rendering what is after all the very essence of a poem, \xc3\x91 \rits exact metrical quality. Birch has created an entirely different \rform of strophe in which all four lines are alike, each containing \rseven principal accents, with the caesura, following the fourth foot. \rLettsom makes the first serious attempt to reproduce the original \rstrophe. It is evident from the introduction to his translation \r(see p. xxvi) that he had made a careful study of its form, and he \rdoes in fact reproduce the first three lines exactly. Of the fourth \rline he says: "I have not thought it expedient to make a rale of \rthus lengthening the fourth lines of the stanzas, though I have \rlengthened them occasionally "(\'?)\xc2\xa5 What moved him thus to \r\r\r\rXXXIV \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\r\r\rdeprive the stanza of its most striking feature\xc3\x91 and one, more- \rover, that is easily preserved in English\xc3\x91 he does not make clear. \rThe versions of Foster-Barham and of Horton and Bell show the \rsame disfigurement, the latter omitting the extra accent of the \rfourth line, as they say, "for the sake of euphony"(!). It is just \rthis lengthened close of each strophe that gives the Nibelungenlied \rits peculiar metrical character and contributes not a little to the \ravoidance of monotony in a poem of over two thousand strophes. \rIn theory the form of the fourth fine as it stands in the original \ris no more foreign to the genius of the English language than to \rthat of modern German, and few of the many Germans giving \ra modernized version of the epic have been bold enough to lay \rsacrilegious hands upon it to shorten it. \r\rA brief account of the Nibelungen strophe may not be out of \rplace here, owing to the fact that its character has generally been \rmisunderstood. The origin and evolution of the strophe have \rbeen the subject of much discussion, the results of which we need \rnot pause to formulate here. As it appears in actual practice \rin our poem of about the year 1 200, it was as follows : Each strophe \rconsists of four long fines, the first line rhyming with the second, \rand the third with the fourth. The rhymes are masculine that \ris, rhymes on the end syllable. Each line is divided by a clearly \rmarked c<esura into two halves; each half of the first three mes \rand the first half of the fourth line has three accented syUables, \rthe second half of the fourth line has four accented syUables. The \rfirst half of each line ends in an unaccented syllable\xc3\x91 or, strictly \rspeaking, in a syllable bearing a secondary accent; that is, each \rline has what is called a " ringing" caesura. The metrical character \rof the Nibelungen strophe is thus due to its fixed number of accented \rsyllables. Of unaccented syllables the number may vary within \rcertain limits. Ordinarily each accented syllable is preceded \rby an unaccented one ; that is, the majority of feet are iambic. 1 tie \runaccented syllable may, however, at times be wanting, or there \rmay, on the other hand, be two or even three of them together. \rA characteristic of the second half of the last line is that there is \rvery frequently no unaccented syllable between the second and \rthe third accented ones. Among occasional variations of the \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGENLIED xxxv \r\rnormal strophe as here described may be mentioned the following: \rThe end-rhyme is in a few instances feminine instead of masculine; \rwhile on the other hand the ending of the first half-lines is occasion- \rally masculine instead of feminine, that is, the caesura is not "ring- \ring." In a few scattered instances we find strophes that rhyme \rthroughout in the caesura as well as at the end of lines; * occasionally \rthe first and second lines, or still less frequently the third and fourth, \ralone have caesural rhyme. f Rhyming of the caesura may be \rregarded as accidental in most cases, but it is reproduced as exactly \ras possible in this translation. \r\rIn the original the opening strophe, which is altogether more \rregular than the average and is, moreover, one of the few that have \ralso complete caesural rhyme, is as follows: \r\rUns ist in alten masren wunders vil geseit \r\rvon heleden lobebaeren, von grozer arebeit, \r\rvon frouden, hochgeziten, von weinen und von klagen, \r\rvon kiiener recken striten muget ir nu wunder hoeren sagen. \r\r\r\r"s^- \r\r\r\rHere the only place where the unaccented syllable is lacking before \rthe accented is before wunders at the beginning of the second half \rof the first fine. A strophe showing more typical irregularities is, \rfor instance, the twenty-second: \r\rIn sinen besten ziten, bi sinen jungen tagen, \rman mohte michel wunder von Sivride sagen, \rwaz eren an im wtiehse und wie scoene was sin lip. \rsit heten in, ze minne diii vil waetlichen wip. \r\rHere the rhyme of the first and second lines is still masculine, tagen \rand sagen being pronounced tagn and sagn. The unaccented \rsyllable is lacking, e.g., before the second accent of the second \rhalf of line two, also before the first and the third accent of the \rsecond half Of line four. There are two unaccented syllables at \rthe beginning (Auftakt) of the second half of line three. The absence \rof the unaccented syllable between the second and the third accent \rjf the last half of the fourth fine of a strophe, as here, is so frequent \r\r* Strophes i, 17, 102, and possibly 841. \r\rt Strophes 18, 69, 103, 115, 129, 148, 177, 190, 198, 222, 231, \r\r39. 293. 3 2 5> 345- 363, 485, 5 8 4, 7\xc2\xa13. 7 I2 > 8 59. 864, 894, 937, 1022, \r032, 1114, 1225, 1432, 1436, 1460, 1530, 1555, 1597, 1855, 1909, \r944. i95 6 \xc3\x88 21 33> 220 \xc2\xa1. 22 o6, 2338. \r\r\r\rxxxvi THE NIBELUNGENLIED \r\rin the poem as to amount almost to a rule; it shows an utter mis- \rconception, or disregard, of its true character, nevertheless, to treat \rthis last half-line as having only three accented syllables, as all \rtranslators hitherto have done. \r\r8.

Upon her nearest kin, \rThat they did slay him later, how wreaked she vengeance wild! \rThrough death of this one hero died many another mother\'s child. \r\r\r\rSECOND ADVENTURE \r\r\r\rSECOND ADVENTURE \r\rSiegtrieD \r\r20 \rThere grew likewise in Netherland a prince of noble kind, \rSiegmund hight his father, his mother Siegelind\xc3\x91 \rWithin a lordly castle well known the country o\'er, \rBy the Rhine far downward: Xanten was the name it bore. \r\r21 \rSiegfried they did call him, this bold knight and good; \rMany a realm he tested, for brave was he of mood. \rHe rode to prove his prowess in many a land around: \rHeigh-ho! what thanes of mettle anon in Burgundy he found! \r\r22 \rIn the springtime of his vigor, when he was young and bold, \rCould tales of mickle wonder of Siegfried be told, \rHow he grew up in honor, and how fair he was to see: \rAnon he won the favor of many a debonair lady. \r\r23 \rAs for a prince was fitting, they fostered him with care: \rYet how the knightly virtues to him native were! \r\'Twas soon the chiefest glory of his father\'s land, \rThat he in fullest measure endowed with princely worth did stand. \r\r24 \rHe soon was grown in stature that he at court did ride. \rThe people saw him gladly, lady and maid beside \rDid wish that his own liking might lead him ever there. \rThat they did lean unto him the knight was soon right well aware. \r\r2 S \rIn youth they let him never without safe escort ride; \rSoon bade Siegmund and Siegelind apparel rich provide; \rMen ripe in wisdom taught him, who knew whence honor came. \rThus many lands and people he won by his wide-honored name. \r\r\r\rSIEGFRIED \r\r\r\r26 \rNow was he of such stature that he could weapons bear: \rOf what thereto he needed had he an ample share. \rThen to think of loving fair maids did he begin, \rAnd well might they be honored for wooer Siegfried bold to win. \r\r27 \rThen bade his father Siegmund make known to one and all \rThat he with his good kinsmen would hold high festival. \rAnd soon were tidings carried to all the neighboring kings; \rTo friends at home and strangers steeds gave he and rich furnishings. \r\r28 \rWherever they found any who knight was fit to be \rBy reason of his kindred, all such were courteously \rUnto the land invited to join the festal throng, \rWhen with the prince so youthful on them the knightly sword was \r\rhung. \r\r29 \rOf this high time of revelry might I great wonders tell. \rSiegmund and Siegelind great honor won full well, \rSuch store of goodly presents they dealt with generous hand, \rThat knights were seenfullmany from far come pricking to their land. \r\r3\xc2\xa1 \rFour hundred lusty squires were there to be clad \rIn knight\'s full garb with Siegfried. Full many a beauteous maid \rAt work did never tire, for dear they did him hold \rAnd many a stone full precious those ladies laid within the gold, \r\r3 T \rThat they upon the doublets embroidered cunningly \rOf those soon to be knighted: t was thus it had to be \rSeats bade the host for many a warrior bold make right _ \rAgainst the high midsummer, when Siegfried won the nameof kmght. \r\r32 \rThen went unto the minster full many a noble kmght _ \rAnd gallant squires beside them. The elder there with right \rDid wait upon the younger, as once for them was done. \rThey were all light-hearted, in hope of pleasure every one. \r\r\r\rSECOND ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r33 \rGod to praise and honor they sang the mass\' song; \rThere, too, were crowds of people, a great and surging throng, \rWhen after knightly custom knighthood received they then, \rIn such a stately pageant as scarce might ever be again. \r\r34 \rThey hastened where they found them saddled many a steed; \rIn the court of Siegmund\'s castle they tilted with such speed \' \rThat far the din resounded through castle and through hall, \rAs in the play with clamor did join the fiery riders all. \r\r35 \rWell-tried old knights and youthful met there in frequent clash, \rThere was sound of shattered lances that through the air did crash, \rAnd along before the castle were splinters seen to fly \rFrom hands of knights a many: each with other there did vie \r\r36 \rThe king he bade give over: they led the chargers out: \rThere was seen all shattered many a boss well-wrought, \rAnd many a stone full costly lay there upon the sward \rFrom erstwhile shining shield-bands, now broken in the jousting \rhard. \r\r37 \rThe guests all went thereafter where seats for them were reared; \rThey by the choicest viands from weariness were cheered, \rAnd wine, of all the rarest, that then in plenty flowed. \rUpon both friends and strangers were fitting honors rich bestowed \r\rIn such merry manner all day did last the feast. \r\rMany a wandering minstrel knew not any rest, \r\rBut sang to win the presents dealt out with bounteous hand; \r\rAnd with their praise was honored far and wide King Siegmund\'s \r\rland. \r\r_ 39 \r\rThe monarch then did order Siegfried his youthful son \rIn fee give lands and castles, as he erstwhile had done. \rTo all his sword-companions he gave with such full hand, \rThat joyed they o\'er the journey they now had made unto that land. \r\r\r\rSIEGFRIED 9 \r\r40 \rThe festival yet lasted until the seventh day. \rSiegelind after old custom in plenty gave away \r\xc3\x91 For so her son she honored \xc3\x91 ? rich gifts of shining gold: \rIn sooth deserved she richly that all should him in honor hold. \r\r4i \rNever a wandering minstrel was unprovided found: \rHorses there and raiment so free were dealt around, \rAs if to live they had not beyond it one day more. \rI ween a monarch\'s household ne\'er bestowed such gifts before. \r\r42 \rThus closed the merry feasting in this right worthy way, \rAnd \'t was well known thereafter how those good knights did say \rThat they the youthful hero for king would gladly have; \rBut this nowise he* wished for, Siegfried the stately knight and brave. \r\r43 \rWhile that they both were living, Siegmund and Siegelind, \rNo crown their son desired, \xc3\x91 thereto he had no mind. \rYet would he fain be master o\'er all the hostile might \rThat in the lands around him opposed the keen and fiery knight. \r\r\r\rTHIRD ADVENTURE. \r1bow Siegfried came to Worms \r\r44 \rSeldom in sooth, if ever, the hero\'s heart was sad. \rHe heard them tell the story, how that a winsome maid \rThere lived afar in Burgundy, surpassing fair to see: \rGreat joy she brought him later, but eke she brought him misery. \r\r45 \rOf her exceeding beauty the fame spread far and near, \rAnd of the thing, moreover, were knights oft-times aware \rHow the maid\'s high spirit no mortal could command: \rThe thing lured many a stranger from far unto King Gunther\'s land. \r\r\r\rIO \r\r\r\rTHIRD ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r46 \rAlthough to win her favor were many wooers bent, \rIn her & own heart would never Kriemhild thereto consent \rThat any one amongst them for lover she would have: \rStill to her was he a stranger to whom anon her troth she gave. \r\r47 \rTo true love turned his fancy the son of Siegelind. \r\'Gainst his, all others\' wooing was like an idle wind: \rFull well did he merit a lady fair to woo, \rAnd soon the noble Kriemhild to Siegfried bold was wedded true. \r\r48 \rBy friends he oft was counselled, and many a faithful man, \rSince to think of wooing in earnest he began, \rThat he a wife should find him of fitting high degree. \rThen spoke the noble Siegfried: " In sooth fair Kriemhild shall it be ; \r\r49 \r"The noble royal maiden in Burgundy that dwells, \rFor sake of all her beauty. Of her the story tells, \rNe\'er monarch was so mighty that, if for spouse he sighed, \r\'Twere not for him befitting to take the princess for his bride. \r\r5\xc2\xa1 \rUnto King Siegmund also the thing was soon made known. \rHis people talked about it, whereby to him was shown \rThe Prince\'s fixed purpose. It grieved him sorely, too, \rThat his son intent was the full stately maid to woo. \r\r51 \rSiegelind asked and learned it, the noble monarch\'s wife. \rFor her loved son she sorrowed lest he should lose his Me, \rFor well she knew the humor of Gunther and his men. \rThen gan they from the wooing strive to turn the noble thane. \r\r52 \rThen said the doughty Siegfried: "O father dear to me, \rWithout the love of woman would I ever be, \rCould I not woo in freedom where\'er my heart is set. \rWhate\'er be said by any, I\'ll keep the selfsame purpose yet." \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS n \r\r\r\r53 \r"Since thou wilt not give over," the king in answer said, \r"Am I of this thy purpose inwardly full glad, \rAnd straightway to fulfil it I\'ll help as best I can, \rYet in King Gunther\'s service is many a haughty-minded man. \r\r"And were there yet none other than Hagen, warrior-knight, \rHe with such haughty bearing is wont to show his might, \rThat I do fear right sorely that sad our end may be, \rIf we set out with purpose to win the stately maid for thee." \r\r55 \r"Shall we by that be hindered?" outspake Siegfried then; \r"Whate\'er in friendly fashion I cannot obtain \rI\'ll yet in other manner take that, with sword in hand. \rI trow from them I\'ll further wrest both their vassals and their land." \r\r5 6 \r"I grieve to hear thy purpose," said Siegmund the king; \r"If any one this story unto the Rhine should bring, \rThen durst thou never after within that land be seen. \rGunther and Gemot, \xc3\x91well known to me they long have been. \r\r57 \r"By force, however mighty, no man can win the maid," \rSpake King Siegmund further, "to me hath oft been said. \rBut if with knightly escort thither thou wilt ride, \rGood friends\xc3\x91 an have we any\xc3\x91 shall soon be summoned to thy \rside." \r\r5 8 \r"No wish," then answered Siegfried, "it ever was of mine, \rThat warrior knights should follow with me unto the Rhine \rAs if arrayed for battle: \'twould make my heart fuU sad, \rTo force in hostile manner to yield to me the stately maid. \r\r59 \r"By my own hand\xc3\x91 thus only\xc3\x91 trust I to win my bride; \rWith none but twelve in company to Gunther\'s land I\'ll ride. \rIn this, O royal father, thy present help I pray." \rGray and white fur raiment had his companions for the way. \r\r\r\r12 THIRD ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r60 \r\rSiegelind his mother then heard the story too, \rAnd grieved she was on hearing what her dear son would do, \rFor she did fear to lose him at hands of Gunther\'s men. \rThereat with heart full heavy began to weep the noble queen, \r\r61 \rThen came forth Sir Siegfried where the queen he sought, \rAnd to his weeping mother thus gently spake his thought: \r"No tear of grief thou shouldest ever shed for me, \rFor I care not a tittle for all the warriors that be. \r\r62 \r"So help me on my journey to the land of Burgundy, \rAnd furnish such apparel for all my knights and me, \rAs warriors of our station might well with honor wear. \rThen I in turn right truly to thee my gratitude will swear." \r\r63 \r"Since thou wilt not give over," Siegelind then replied, \r"My only son, I\'ll help thee as fits thee forth to ride, \rWith the best apparel that riders ever wore, \rThee and thy companions: ye shall of all have goodly store." \r\r64 \rThen bowed the youthful Siegfried the royal dame before, \rAnd said: "Upon the journey will I take no more, \rBut twelve good knights only: for these rich dress provide, \rFor I would know full gladly how \'t doth with Kriemhild betide." \r\r65 \rThen sat at work fair women by night and eke by day, \r\rAnd rest indeed but little from busy toil had they, \r\rUntil they had made ready the dress Siegfried should wear. \r\rFirm bent upon the journey, no other counsel would he hear. \r\r66 \rHis father bade a costly garb for him prepare, \rThat leaving Siegmund\'s country he the same might wear. \rFor all their glittering breastplates were soon prepared beside, \rAnd helmets firmly welded, and shining shields long and wide. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS 13 \r\r67 \rThen fast the day grew nearer when they should thence depart. \rMen and likewise women went sorrowing in heart, \rIf that they should ever see more their native land. \rWith full equipment laden the sumpter horses there did stand. \r\r68 \rTheir steeds were stately, furnished with trappings rich with gold; \rIt were a task all bootless to seek for knights more bold \rThan were the gallant Siegfried and his chosen band. \rHe longed to take departure straightway for Burgundian land. \r\r69 \rLeave granted they with sadness, both the king and queen, \rThe which to turn to gladness sought the warrior keen, \rAnd spake then: "Weep ye shall not at all for sake of me, \rForever free from doubtings about my safety may ye be." \r\r70 \rStern warriors stood there sorrowing, \xc3\x91 in tears was many a maid. \rI ween their hearts erred nothing, as sad forebodings said \rThat \'mongst their friends so many thereby were doomed to die. \rGood cause had they to sorrow at last o\'er all their misery. \r\rUpon the seventh morning to Worms upon the strand \r\rDid come the keen knights riding. Bright shone many a band \r\rOf gold from their apparel and rich equipment then; \r\rAnd gently went their chargers with Siegfried and his chosen men. \r\r72 \rNew-made shields they carried that were both strong and wide \rAnd brightly shone their helmets as thus to court did ride \rSiegfried the keen warrior into King Gunther\'s land. \rOf knights before was never beheld so richly clad a band. \r\r73 \rThe points of their long scabbards reached down unto the spur, \r\rAnd spear full sharply pointed bore each chosen warrior. \r\rThe one that Siegfried carried in breadth was two good span, \r\rAnd grimly cut its edges when driven by the fearless man. \r\r\r\rI4 THIRD ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r74 \rReins with gold all gleaming held they in the hand, \rThe saddle-bands were silken. So came they to the land. \rOn every side the people to gape at them began, \rAnd also out to meet them the men that served King Gunther ran. \r\r75 \rGallant men high-hearted, knight and squire too, \rHastened to receive them, for such respect was due, \rAnd bade the guests be welcome unto their master\'s land. \rThey took from them their chargers, and shields as well from out the \r\rhand. \r\r76 \rThen would they eke the chargers lead forth unto their rest; \rBut straight the doughty Siegfried to them these words addressed: \r"Yet shall ye let our chargers stand the while near by; \rSoon take we hence our journey; thereon resolved full well am I. \r\r77 \r"If that be known to any, let him not delay, \rWhere I your royal master now shall find, to say, \xc3\x91 \rGunther, king so mighty o\'er the land of Burgundy." \rThen told him one amongst them to whom was known where that \rmight be : \r\r78 \r"If that the king thou seekest, right soon may he be found. \rWithin that wide hall yonder with his good knights around \rBut now I saw him sitting. Thither do thou repair, \rAnd thou may\'st find around him many a stately warrior there." \r\r79 \rNow also to the monarch were the tidings told, \rThat within his castle were knights arrived full bold, \rAll clad in shining armor and apparelled gorgeously; \rBut not a man did know them within the land of Burgundy. \r\r80 \rThereat the king did wonder whence were come to him \rThese knights adventure seeking in dress so bright and trim, \rAnd shields adorned so richly that new and mighty were. \rThat none the thing could tell him did grieve him sorely to hear. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS i 5 \r\r\r\r81 \r\rOutspake a knight then straightway, Ortwein by name was he \rStrong and keen as any well was he known to be: \r"Since we of them know nothing, bid some one quickly go \rAnd fetch my uncle Hagen: to him thou shalt the strangers show. \r\r82 \r"To him are known far kingdoms and every foreign land \rAnd if he know these strangers we soon shall understand \xc3\x88 \rThe king then sent to fetch him: with his train of men \rUnto the king\'s high presence in stately gear went he then. \r\r83 \rWhat were the king\'s good pleasure, asked Hagen grim in war \r\rIn the court Within my castle are warriors from afar \rAnd no one here doth know them: if them thou e\'er didst see \rIn any land far distant, now shalt thou, Hagen, tell to me " \r\r84 \r"That will I do, \'tis certain."- To a window then he went \rAnd on the unknown strangers his keen eye he bent \rWell pleased him their equipment and the rich dress they wore \rYet ne\'er had he beheld them in land of Burgundy before \r\r8 5 \rHe said that whencesoever these knights come to the Rhine \rI hey bear a royal message, or are of princely line. \r"Their steeds are so bedizened, and their apparel rare- \rNo matter whence they journey, high-hearted men in truth thev \rare." J \r\r86 \rFurther then spake Hagen: "As far as goes my ken, \rThough I the noble Siegfried yet have never seen, \rYet will I say meseemeth, howe\'er the thing may be, \rThis knight who seeks adventure, and yonder stands so proud, is he. \r\r87 \r" \'Tis some new thing he bringeth hither to our land \rThe valiant Nibelungen fell by the hero\'s hand, \rSchilbung and Nibelung, from royal sire sprung- \rDeeds he wrought most wondrous anon when his strong arm he \rswung. \xc2\xa1 \r\r\r\rl6 THIRD ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r88 \r"As once alone the hero rode without company, \rFound he before a mountain -as hath been told to me- \rWith the hoard of Nibelung full many stalwart men; \r^ mm had they been strangers until he chanced to hnd them then. \r\r-The hoard of King Nibelung entire did they bear \r\rForth from a mountain hollow. And now the wonder hear, \r\rHow that they would share it, these two Nibelung men \r\rtZ saw the fearless Siegfried, and filled he was with wonder then. \r\r90 \r-He came so near unto them that he the knights espied, \rAnd they in turn him also. One amongst them said: \r\'Here comes the doughty Siegfried, hero of Netherlands \rsfnce \'mongst the Nibdungen strange wonders wrought his mighty \r\rhand. 91 \r\r-Right well did they receive him, Schilbung and Nibelung, \rAnd straight they both together, these noble princes young, \rBade himmete out the treasure, the full val orcus man, \rAnd so long time besought him that he at last the task began. \r\r-As we have heard in story, he saw of gems such store \rThat they might not be laden on wagons full five score, \rMore still of gold all shining from Nibelungenland \rTwas all to be divided between them by keen Siegfried\'s hand. \r\r93 \r-Then gave they him for hire King Nibelung\'s sword. \rAnd socfth to say, that service brought them but small reward, \rThat for them there performed Siegfried of dauntless moodL \rHis task he could not finish; thereat they raged as were they wood. \r\r94 . \r\r-They had there of their followers twelve warriors keen \rAnd strong they were as giants: what booted giants e en? \rThem slew straightway in anger Siegfried\'s mighty hand \rAnd warriors seven hundred he felled in Nibelungenland \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS 17 \r\r95 \r"With the sword full trusty, Balmung that hight. \rFull many a youthful warrior from terror at the sight \rOf that deadly weapon swung by his mighty hand \rDid render up his castle and pledge him fealty in the land. \r\r96 \r"Thereto the kings so mighty, them slew he both as well. \rBut into gravest danger through Alberich he fell, \rWho thought for his slain masters vengeance to wreak straightway, \rUntil the mighty Siegfried his wrath with strong arm did stay. \r\r97 \r"Nor could prevail against him the Dwarf, howe\'er he tried. \r\rE\'en as two wild lions they coursed the mountainside, \r\rWhere he the sightless mantle * from Alberich soon won. \r\rThen Siegfried, knight undaunted, held the treasure for his own. \r\r98 \r"Who then dared join the struggle, all slain around they lay. \rThen he bade the treasure to draw and bear away \rThither whence \'twas taken by the Nibelungen men. \rAlberich for his valor was then appointed Chamberlain. \r\r99 \r"An oath he had to swear him, he\'d serve him as his slave; \r\rTo do all kinds of sendee his willing pledge he gave" \xc3\x91 \xc2\xa5 \r\rThus spake of Tronje Hagen \xc3\x91 "That has the hero done; \r\rMight as great before him was never in a warrior known. \r\r100 \r"Still know I more about him, that has to me been told. \rA dragon, wormlike monster, slew once the hero bold. \rThen in its blood he bathed him, since when his skin hath been \rSo horn-hard, ne\'er a weapon can pierce it, as hath oft been seen. \r\r101 \r\r"Let us the brave knight-errant receive so courteously \r\rThat we in nought shall merit his hate, for strong is he. \r\rHe is so keen of spirit he must be treated fair: \r\rHe has by his own valor done many a deed of prowess rare." \r\r* This is the tarnkappe, a cloak that made the wearer invisible, \rand also gave him the strength of twelve men. \r\r\r\rl8 THIRD ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r102 \r\r\r\rThe monarch spake in wonder: "In sooth thou Idlest right. \rNow see how proudly yonder he stands prepared for fight, \rHe and his thanes together, the hero wondrous keen! \rTo greet him we\'ll go thither, and let our fair intent be seen. \r\r103 \r-That canst thou," out spake Hagen, "well in honor do. \rHe is of noble kindred, a high king\'s son thereto. \r\'Tis seen in all his bearing; meseems in truth, God wot, \rThe tale is worth the hearing that this bold knight has hither \r\rbrought." \r\r104 \rThen spake the mighty monarch: "Be he right welcome here. \rKeen is he and noble, of fame known far and near \rSo shall he be fair treated in the land of Burgundy. \rDown then went King Gunther, and Siegfried with his men found he. \r\r105 \rThe king and his knights with him received so well the guest, \rThat the hearty greeting did their good will attest. \rThereat in turn the stranger in reverence bowed low \rThat in their welcome to him they did such courtesy bestow. \r\r106 \r"To me it is a wonder," straightway spake the host \r-From whence, O noble Siegfried, come to our land thou dost, \rOr what here thou seekest at Worms upon the Rhine \rHim the stranger answered: "Put thou away all doubts of thine. \r\r107 \r"I oft have heard the tiding within my sire\'s domain^ \rHow at thy court resided -and know this would I fain- \rKnights, of all the keenest, -\'tis often told me so- \rThat e\'er a monarch boasted: now come I hither this to know. \r\r108 \xc2\xa5 \r\'\'Thyself have I heard also high praised for knightly worth; \r\'Tis said a nobler monarch ne\'er lived in all the earth. \rThus speak of thee the people in all the lands around. \rNor will I e\'er give over until in this the truth I\'ve found. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS 19 \r\r109 \r"I too am warrior noble and born to wear a crown; \rSo would I right gladly that thou of me shouldst own \rThat I of right am master o\'er people and o\'er land. \rOf this shall now my honor and eke my head as pledges stand. \r\rno \r"And art thou then so valiant as hath to me been told, \rI reck not, will he nill he thy best warrior bold, \rI\'ll wrest from thee in combat whatever thou may\'st have; \rThy lands and all thy castles shall naught from change of masters \rsave." \r\rin \rThe king was seized with wonder and all his men beside, \rTo see the manner haughty in which the knight replied \rThat he was fully minded to take from him his land. \rIt chafed his thanes to hear it, who soon in raging mood did stand. \r\r112 \r"How could it be my fortune," Gunther the king outspoke, \r"What my sire long ruled over in honor for his folk, \rNow to lose so basely through any vaunter\'s might? \rIn sooth \'twere nobly showing that we too merit name of knight ! " \r\r113 \r"Nowise will I give over," was the keen reply. \r\r"If peace through thine own valor thy land cannot enjoy, \rTo me shall all be subject: if heritage of mine \rThrough thy arm\'s might thou winnest, of right shall all hence- \rforth be thine. \r\r114 \r"Thy land and all that mine is, at stake shall equal lie. \rWhiche\'er of us be victor when now our strength we try, \rTo him shall all be subject, the folk and eke the land." \rBut Hagen spake against it, and Gemot too was quick at hand. \r\r"5 \r\r"Such purpose have we never," Gemot then said, \r\r"For lands to combat ever, that any warrior dead \r\rShould lie in bloody battle. We\'ve mighty lands and strong; \r\rOf right they call us master, and better they to none belong." \r\r\r\rTHIRD ADVENTURE \r116 \r\r\r\rThere stood full g*. and ^9^^^ \rAnd there as well amongst then . was Ortwe ^ \r\rr^\'^"^^^^ 8 ^ th \xc2\xa1 U art \r\r..\xc3\xa3 thou and th, two hrothe, g-g- *!*\xc3\x87 "-* \rAnd if a mighty army I.*"*, SQ | een \r^^L^sotU^p replace hy meeker mien. \r\rThereat did rage fall sorely jfb\xc3\x88 of \xc3\x87tnd. \r\r?\xc2\xa5Never shall be measured p- ~\xc3\x88 serving-knight; \r\r^f Tucn \xc3\x88?=? rn^vithstand - - - ^ \r\rFor swords then ealled in anger "\'of Met* Sir Ortwein: \rSon of Hagen\'s sister he was o^Tron s me. ^ , \r\rThat Hagen so \'\xc2\xa1\xc3\x87g^^- a gS knight aid keen was he. \rGemot made peace between mem . 5 \r\r120 \r\xc2\xa5w \xc2\xa5\xc3\xa3\xc2\xa5 "Curb now thy wrathful tongue, \rSpake he thus to Ortwein.

\r"For though should die in battle a host of valiant men \r\'Twould bring us little honor and ye could profit none." \rThereto gave Siegfried answer, good King Siegmund\'s noble son: \r\rI2 5 \r"Wherefore bides thus grim Hagen, and Ortwein tardy is \rTo begin the combat with all those friends of his, \rOf whom he hath so many here in Burgundy?" \rAnswer him they durst not, for such was Gernot\'s stern decree. \r\r126 \r"Thou shalt to us be welcome," outspake young Giselher, \r"And all thy brave companions that hither with thee fare. \rFull gladly we\'ll attend thee, I and all friends of mine." \rFor the guests then bade they pour out in store of Gunther\'s wine. \r\r127 \rThen spake the stately monarch: "But ask thou courteously, \rAnd all that we call ours stands at thy service free; \rSo with thee our fortune we\'ll share in ill and good." \rThereat the noble Siegfried a little milder was of mood. \r\r128 \rThen carefully was tended all their knightly gear, \rAnd housed in goodly manner in sooth the strangers were, \rAll that followed Siegfried; they found a welcome rest. \rIn Burgundy full gladly anon was seen the noble guest. \r\r129 \rThey showed him mickle honor thereafter many a day, \rAnd more by times a thousand than I to you could say. \rHis might respect did merit, ye may full well know that. \rScarce a man e\'er saw him who bore him longer any hate. \r\r\r\r22 THIRD ADVENTURE \r\r130 \rAnd when they held their pastime, the kings with many a man, \rThen was he ever foremost; whatever they began, \rNone there that was his equal, \xc3\x91 so mickle was his might \xc3\x91 \rIf they the stone were putting, or hurling shaft with rival knight. \r\r131 \rAs is the knightly custom, before the ladies fair \r\rTo games they turned for pastime, these knights of mettle rare; \r\rThen ever saw they gladly the hero of Netherland. \r\rBut he had fixed his fancy to win one fairest maiden\'s hand. \r\r132 \rIn all that they were doing he\'d take a ready part. \rA winsome loving maiden he bore within his heart; \rHim only loved that lady, whose face he ne\'er had seen, \rBut she full oft in secret of him spake fairest words, I ween. \r\r133 \rAnd when before the castle they sped in tournamei\xc3\x91 , \r\rThe good knights and squires, oft-times the maiden went \r\rAnd gazed adown from casement, Kriemhild the princess rare. \r\rPastime there was none other for her that could with this compare. \r\r134 \rAnd knew he she was gazing whom in his heart he bore, \rHe joy enough had found him in jousting evermore. \rAnd might he only see her, \xc3\x91 that can I well believe \xc3\x91 \rOn earth through sight none other his eyes could such delight re- \rceive. \r\r135 \r\rWhene\'er with his companions to castle court he went, \r\rE\'en as do now the people whene\'er on pleasure bent, \rThere stood \'fore all so graceful Siegelind\'s noble son, \rFor whom in love did languish the hearts of ladies many a one. \r\r136 \rEke thought he full often: "How shall it ever be, \rThat I the noble maiden with my own eyes may see, \rWhom I do love so dearly and have for many a day? \rTo me is she a stranger, which sorely grieves my heart to say." \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS 23 \r\r137 \rWhene\'er the kings so might)/ rode o\'er their broad domain, \r\rThen of valiant warriors they took a stately train. \r\rWith them abroad rode Siegfried, which grieved those ladies sore: \r\r\xc3\x91 He too for one fair maiden at heart a mickle burden bore. \r\r138 \rThus with his hosts he lingered \xc3\x91 \'tis every tittle true \xc3\x91 \rIn King Gunther\'s country a year completely through, \rAnd never once the meanwhile the lovely maid did see, \rThrough whom such joy thereafter for him, and eke such grief, \rshould be. \r\rFOURTH ADVENTURE \rTbow Siegfried fougbt witb tbc Sajons \r\r*39 \r\rNow come wondrous tidings to King Gunther\'s land, \r\rBy messengers brought hither from far upon command \rOf knights unknown who harbored against him secret hate. \rWhen there was heard the story, at heart in sooth the grief was \r\rgreat. \r\r140 \rOf these I now will tell you: There was King Luedeger \rFrom out the land of Saxons, a mighty warrior, \rAnd eke from land of Denmark Luedegast the king: \rWhene\'er they rode to battle went they with mighty following. \r\r141 \rCome were now their messengers to the land of Burgundy, \rSent forth by these foemen in proud hostility. \rThen asked they of the strangers what tidings they did bring: \rAnd when they heard it, straightway led them to court before the \r\rking. \r\r142 \rThen spake to them King Gunther: "A welcome, on my word. \rWho \'tis that send you hither, that have I not yet heard: \rNow shall ye let me know it," spake the monarch keen. \rThen dreaded they full sorely to see King Gunther\'s angry mien. \r\r\r\r24 FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r143 \r"Wilt thou, O king, permit us the tidings straight to tell \r\rThat we now have brought thee, no whit will we conceal, \rBut name thee both our masters who us have hither sent: \rLuedegast and Luedeger, \xc3\x91 to waste thy land is their intent. \r\r144 \r"Their hate hast thou incurred, and thou shalt know in sooth \rThat high enraged against thee are the monarchs both. \rTheir hosts they will lead hither to Worms upon the Rhine; \rThey\'re helped by thanes full many \xc3\x91 of this put off all doubts of \rthine. \r\r145 \r"Within weeks a dozen their march will they begin; \r\rAnd if thy friends be valiant, let that full quick be seen, \r\rTo help thee keep in safety thy castles and thy land: \r\rFull many a shield and helmet shall here be cleft by warrior\'s hand \r\r146 \r\r"Or wilt thou with them parley, so let it quick be known, \r\rBefore their hosts so mighty of warlike men come down \r\rTo Worms upon Rhine river sad havoc here to make, \r\rWhereby must death most certain many a gallant knight o\'ertake." \r\r147 \r"Bide ye now the meanwhile," the king did answer kind, \r"Till I take better counsel; then shall ye know my mind. \rHave I yet warriors faithful, from these I\'ll naught conceal, \rBut to my friends I\'ll straightway these warlike tidings strange re- \rveal." \r\r148 \rThe lordly Gunther wondered thereat and troubled sore, \rAs he the message pondered in heart and brooded o\'er. \rHe sent to fetch grim Hagen and others of his men, \rAnd bade likewise in hurry to court bring hither Gemot then. \r\r149 \rThus at his word his trusted advisers straight attend. \rHe spake: "Our land to harry foes all unknown will send \rOf men a mighty army; a grievous wrong is this. \rSmall cause have we e\'er given that they should wish us aught \ramiss." \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT WITH THE SAXONS 25 \r\r150 \r"Our swords ward such things from us," Gemot then said; \r\r" Since but the fated dieth, so let all such he dead. \r\rWherefore I\'ll e\'er remember what honor asks of me: \r\rWhoe\'er hath hate against us shall ever here right welcome be." \r\r151 \rThen spake the doughty Hagen : " Me thinks \'twould scarce be good; \rLuedegast and Luedeger are men of wrathful mood. \rHelp can we never summon, the days are now so few." \rSo spake the keen old warrior, " \'Twere well Siegfried the tidings \rknew." \r\r152 \rThe messengers in the borough were harbored well the while, \rAnd though their sight was hateful, in hospitable style \rAs his own guests to tend them King Gunther gave command, \rTill \'mongst his friends he learned who by him in his need would \rstand. \r\r153 \rThe king was filled with sorrow and his heart was sad. \rThen saw his mournful visage a knight to help full glad, \rWho could not well imagine, what \'twas that grieved him so. \rThen begged he of King Gunther the tale of this his grief to know. \r\r154 \r"To me it is great wonder," said Siegfried to the king, \r"How thou of late hast changed to silent sorrowing \rThe joyous ways that ever with us thy wont have been." \rThen unto him gave answer Gunther the full stately thane: \r\riS5 \r" \'Tis not to every person I can the burden say \rThat ever now in secret upon my heart doth weigh: \rTo well-tried friends and steady are told our inmost woes." \r\xc3\x91 Siegfried at first was pallid, but soon his blood like fire up-rose. \r\r156 \rHe spake unto the monarch: "To thee I\'ve naught denied. \rAll ills that now do threaten I\'ll help to turn aside. \rAnd if but friends thou seekest, of them the first I\'ll be, \rAnd trow I well with honor till death to serve thee faithfully." \r\r\r\r2 6 FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r157 \r"God speed thee well, Sir Siegfried, for this thy purpose fair: \rAnd though such help in earnest thy arm should render ne\'er, \rYet do I joy at hearing thou art so true to me. \rAnd live I yet a season, right heartily repaid \'twill be. \r\r158 \r"Know will I also let thee wherefore I sorrowing stand. \rThrough messengers from my foemen have tidings reached my land \rThat they with hosts of warriors will ride my country o\'er; \rSuch thing to us did never thanes of any land before." \r\r"Small cause is that for grieving," said then Siegfried; \r"But calm thy troubled spirit and hearken to my rede: \rLet me for thee acquire honor and vantage too, \rAnd bid thou now assemble for service eke thy warriors true. \r\r160 \r"And had thy mighty enemies to help them now at hand \rGood thanes full thirty thousand, against them all I\'d stand, \rHad I but one good thousand: put all thy trust in me." \rThen answered him King Gunther: "Thy help shall full requited \r\rbe." \r\r161 \r\r"Then bid for me to summon a thousand of thy men, \r\rSince I now have with me of all my knightly train \r\rNone but twelve knights only; then will I guard thy land. \r\rFor thee shall service faithful be done alway by Siegfried\'s hand. \r\r162 \r"Herein shall help us Hagen and eke Ortwein, \rDankwart and Sindold, those trusted knights of thine; \rAnd with us too shall journey Volker, the valiant man; \rThe banner he shall carry: bestow it better ne\'er I can. \r\r163 \r"Back to their native country the messengers may go; \rThey\'ll see us there right quickly, let them full surely know, \rSo that all our castles peace undisturbed shall have." \rThen bade the king to summon his friends with all their warriors \rbrave. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT WITH THE SAXONS 27 \r\r\r\r164 \rTo court returned the heralds King Luedeger had sent, \rAnd on their journey homeward full joyfully they went. \rKing Gunther gave them presents that costly were and good, \rAnd granted them safe convoy; whereat they were of merry mood. \r\r"Tell ye my foes," spake Gunther, "when to your land ye come, \rThan making journeys hither they better were at home; \rBut if they -still be eager to make such visit here, \rUnless my friends forsake me, cold in sooth shall be their cheer." \r\r166 \rThen for^the messengers rich presents forth they bore, \rWhereof in sooth to give them Gunther had goodly store: \rAnd they durst not refuse them whom Luedeger had sent. \rLeave then they took immediate, and homeward joyfully they went. \r\r167 \rWhen to their native Denmark the messengers returned, \rAnd the king Luedegast the answer too had learned, \rThey at the Rhine had sent him, \xc3\x91 when that to him was told, \rHis wrath was all unbounded to have reply in words so bold. \r\r168 \r\'Twas said their warriors numbered many a man full keen: \r"There likewise among them with Gunther have we seen \rOf Netherland a hero, the same that Siegfried hight." \rKing Luedegast was grieved, when he their words had heard aright. \r\r169 \rWhen throughout all Denmark the tidings quick spread o\'er, \rThen in hot haste they summoned helpers all the more, \rSo that King Luedegast, \'twixt friends from far and near, \rHad knights full twenty thousand all furnished well with shield and \rspear. \r\r170 \rThen too his men did summon of Saxony Luedeger, \rTill they good forty thousand, and more, had gathered there, \rWith whom to make the journey \'gainst the land of Burgundy. \r\xc3\x91 At home likewise the meanwhile King Gunther had sent forth \rdecree \r\r\r\r28 FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r171 \rMighty men to summon of his own and brothers twain, \rWho against the foemen would join the armed train. \rIn haste they made them ready, for right good cause they had. \rAmongst them must thereafter full many a noble thane lie dead. \r\r172 \rTo march they quick made ready. And when they thence would fare, \rThe banner to the valiant Volker was given to bear, \rAs they began the journey from Worms across the Rhine; \rStrong of arm grim Hagen was chosen leader of the line. \r\rWith them there rode Sindold and eke the keen Hunold \rWho oft at hands of Gunther had won rewards of gold; \rDankwart, Hagen\'s brother, and Ortwein beside, \rWho all could well with honor in train of noble warriors ride. \r\r\r\r? \r\r\r\r174 \rKing Gunther," spake then Siegfried, "stay thou here at home; \rSince now thy knights so gallant with me will gladly come, \rRest thou here with fair ladies, and be of merry mood: \rI trow we\'ll keep in safety thy land and honor as we should. \r\r175 \r"And well will I see to it that they at home remain, \rWho fain would ride against thee to Worms upon the Rhine. \rAgainst them straight we\'ll journey into their land so far \rThat they\'ll be meeker minded who now such haughty vaunters \r\r\r\rare." \r\r\r\r176 \rThen from the Rhine through Hesse the hosts of knights rode on \rToward the land of Saxons, where battle was anon. \rWith fire and sword they harried and laid the country waste, \rSo that both the monarchs full well the woes of war did taste. \r\r177 \rWhen came they to the border the train-men onward pressed. \rWith thought of battle-order Siegfried the thanes addressed: \r"Who now shall guard our followers from danger in the rear?" \rIn sooth like this the Saxons in battle worsted never were. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT WITH THE SAXONS 29 \r\r\r\r178 \rThen said they: "On the journey the men shall guarded be \rBy the valiant Dankwart, \xc3\x91 a warrior swift is he; \rSo shall we lose the fewer by men of Luedeger. \rLet him and Ortwein with him be chosen now to guard the rear." \r\r?\\ 179 \r\rSpake then the valiant Siegfried: "Myself will now ride on, \rAnd against our enemies will keep watch in the van, \rTill I aright discover where they perchance may be." \rThe son of fair Queen Siegelind did arm him then immediately. \r\r180 \rThe folk he left to Hagen when ready to depart, \rAnd as well to Gemot, a man of dauntless heart. \rInto the land of Saxons alone he rode away, \rAnd by his hand was severed many a helmet\'s band that day. \r\r181 \rHe found a mighty army that lay athwart the plain, \rSmall part of which outnumbered all those in his own train: \rFull forty thousand were they or more good men of might. \rThe hero high in spirit saw right joyfully the sight. \r\r182 \rThen had eke a warrior from out the enemy \rTo guard the van gone forward, all armed cap-a-pie. \rHim saw the noble Siegfried, and he the valiant man; \rEach one straight the other to view with angry mien began. \r\r183 \rWho he was I\'ll tell you that rode his men before, \r\xc3\x91 A shield of gold all shining upon his arm he bore \xc3\x91 \rIn sooth it was King Luedegast who there the van did guard. \rStraightway the noble Siegfried full eagerly against him spurred. \r\r184 \rNow singled out for combat him, too, had Luedegast. \rThen full upon each other they spurred their chargers fast, \rAs on their shields they lowered their lances firm and tight, \rWhereat the lordly monarch soon found himself in sorry plight. \r\r\r\r3 o FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r185 \rAfter the shock their chargers bore the knights so fast \rOnward past each other as flew they on the blast. \rThen turned they deftly backward obedient to the rein, \rAs with their swords contested the grim and doughty fighters twain. \r\r186 \rWhen Siegfried struck in anger far off was heard the blow, \rAnd flew from off the helmet, as if \'twere all aglow, \rThe fiery sparks all crackling beneath his hand around. \rEach warrior in the other a foeman worth his mettle found. \r\r187 \rFull many a stroke with vigor dealt eke King Luedegast, \rAnd on each other\'s buckler the blows fell thick and fast. \rThen thirty men discovered their master\'s sorry plight: \rBut ere they came to help him had doughty Siegfried won the fight \r\r188 \rWith three mighty gashes which he had dealt the king \rThrough his shining breastplate made fast with many a ring. \rThe sword with sharpest edges from wounds brought forth the \r\rblood, \rWhereat King Luedegast apace fell into gloomy mood. \r\r189 \rTo spare his life he begged him, his land he pledged the knight, \rAnd told him straight moreover, that Luedegast he hight. \rThen came his knights to help him, they who there had seen \rHow that upon the vanguard fierce fight betwixt the twain had been. \r\r190 \rAfter duel ended, did thirty yet withstand \rOf knights that him attended; but there the hero\'s hand \rKept safe his noble captive with blows of wondrous might. \rAnd soon wrought greater ruin Siegfried the full gallant knight. \r\r191 \rBeneath his arm of valor the thirty soon lay dead. \rBut one the knight left living, who thence full quickly sped \rTo tell abroad the story how he the others slew; \rIn sooth the blood-red helmet spake all the hapless tidings true. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT WITH THE SAXONS 31 \r\r192 \rThen had the men of Denmark for all their grief good cause, \rWhen it was told them truly their king a captive was. \rThey told it to King Luedeger, when he to rage began \rIn anger all unbounded: for him had grievous harm been done. \r\r193 \rThe noble King Luedegast was led a prisoner then \r\rBy hand of mighty Siegfried back to King Gunther\'s men, \rAnd placed in hands of Hagen: and when they did hear \rThat \'twas the king of Denmark they not a little joyful were. \r\r194 \rHe bade the men of Burgundy then bind the banners on. \r"Now forward!" Siegfried shouted, "here shall yet more be done, \rAn I but live to see it; ere this day\'s sun depart, \rShall mourn in land of Saxons full many a goodly matron\'s heart. \r\ri95 \r"Ye warriors from Rhineland, to follow me take heed, \r\rAnd I unto the army of Luedeger will lead. \r\rEre we again turn backward to the land of Burgundy \r\rHelms many hewn asunder by hand of good knights there shall be." \r\r196 \rTo horse then hastened Gemot and with him mighty men. \rVolker keen in battle took up the banner then; \rHe was a doughty Fiddler and rode the host before. \rThere, too, every follower a stately suit of armor wore. \r\r197 \rMore than a thousand warriors they there had not a man, \rSaving twelve knights-errant. To rise the dust began \rIn clouds along the highway as they rode across the fields, \rAnd gleaming in the sunlight were seen the brightly shining shields. \r\r198 \rMeanwhile eke was nearing of Saxons a great throng, \rEach a broadsword bearing that mickle was and long, \rWith blade that cut full sorely when swung in strong right hand. \r\'Gainst strangers were they ready to guard their castles and their \rland. \r\r\r\rFOURTH ADVEN TURE \r\r\r\r199 \rThe leaders forth to battle led the warriors then. \rCome was also Siegfried with his twelve chosen men, \rWhom he with him hither had brought from Nethenand. \rThat day in storm of battle was blood-bespattered many a hand. \r\r200 \rSindold and Hunold and Gemot as well, \rBeneath their hands in battle full many a hero fell, \rEre that their deeds of valor were known throughout the host \rThrough them must many a stately matron weep for warrior lost. \r\r201 \rVolker and Hagen and Ortwein in the fight \rLustily extinguished full many a helmet\'s light \rWith blood from wounds down flowing - keen fighters every one. \r\rAnd there by Dankwart also was many a mickle wonder done. \r\r202 \r\rThe knights of Denmark tested how they could weapons wield. \r\rClashing there together heard ye many a shield \r\rAnd \'neath sharp swords resounding, swung by many an arm. \r\rThe Saxons keen in combat wrought \'mid their foes a grievous harm. \r\r203 \rWhen the men of Burgundy pressed forward to the fight, \rGaping wounds full many hewed they there with might \rThen flowing down o\'er saddle in streams was seen the blood \rSo fought for sake of honor these valiant riders keen and good. \r\r204 \rLoudly were heard ringing, wielded by hero\'s hand \rThe sharply-cutting weapons, where they of Netherland \rTheir master followed after into the thickest throng: _ \rWherever Siegfried led them rode too those valiant kmghts along. \r\r205 \rOf warriors from Rhine river could follow not a one. \rThere could be seen by any a stream of blood flow down \rO\'er brightly gleaming helmet \'neath Siegfried\'s mighty hand, \rUntil King Luedeger before him with his men did stand. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT WITH THE SAXONS 33 \r\r\r\r206 \rThree times hither and thither had he the host cut through \rFrom one end to the other. Now come was Hagen too \rWho helped him well in battle to vent his warlike mood. \rThat day beneath his valor must die full many a rider good. \r\r207 \rWhen the doughty Luedeger Siegfried there found, \rAs he swung high in anger his arm for blows around \rAnd with his good sword Balmung knights so many slew, \rThereat was the keen warrior rilled with grief and anger too. \r\r208 \rThen mickle was the thronging and loud the broadswords clashed, \rAs all their valiant followers \'gainst one another dashed. \rThen struggled all the fiercer both sides the fight to win; \rThe hosts joined with each other: \'twas frightful there to hear the \r\rdin. \r\r209 \rTo the monarch of the Saxons it had been told before, \rHis brother was a captive, which grieved his heart right sore. \rHe knew not that had done it fair Siegelind\'s son, \rFor rumor said \'twas Gemot. Full well he learned the truth anon. \r\r210 \rKing Luedeger struck so mighty when fierce his anger rose, \rThat Siegfried\'s steed beneath him staggered from the blows, \rBut forthwith did recover; then straight his rider keen \rLet all his furious mettle in slaughter of his foes be seen. \r\r211 \rThere helped him well grim Hagen, and Gemot in the fray, \rDankwart and Volker; dead many a knight there lay. \rSindold and Hunold and Ortwein, doughty thane, \rBy them in that fierce struggle was many a valiant warrior slain. \r\r212 \rUnparted in storm of battle the gallant leaders were, \rAround them over helmet flew there many a spear \rThrough shield all brightly shining, from hand of mighty thane: 1 \rAnd on the glancing armor was seen full many a blood-red stain, J \r\r\r\r34 FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r213 \rAmid the hurly-burly down fell many a man \rTo ground from off his charger. Straight \'gainst each other ran \rSiegfried the keen rider and eke King Luedeger. \rThen flew from lance the splinters and hurled was many a pointed \r\rspear. \r\r214 \r\'Neath Siegfried\'s hand so mighty from shield flew off the band. \rAnd soon to win the victory thought he of Netherland \rOver the valiant Saxons, of whom were wonders seen. \rHeigh-ho ! in shining mail-rings many a breach made Dankwart keen 1 \r\r215 \rUpon the shining buckler that guarded Siegfried\'s breast \rSoon espied King Luedeger a painted crown for crest; \rBy this same token knew he it was the doughty man, \rAnd to his friends he straightway amid the battle loud began: \r\r216 \r"Give o\'er from fighting further, good warriors every one! \rAmongst our foes now see I Siegmund\'s noble son, \rOf netherland the doughty knight on victory bent. \rHim has the evil Devil to scourge the Saxons hither sent." \r\r217 \rThen bade he all the banners amid the storm let down. \rPeace he quickly sued for: \'Twas granted him anon, \rBut he must now a hostage be ta\'en to Gunther\'s land. \rThis fate had forced upon him the fear of Siegfried\'s mighty hand. \r\r218 \rThey thus by common counsel left off all further fight. \rHacked full many a helmet and shields that late were bright \rFrom hands down laid they weary; as many as there might be, \rWith stains they all were bloody \'neath hands of the men of Bur- \rgundy. \r\r219 \rEach whom he would took captive, now they had won the fight. \rGemot, the noble hero, and Hagen, doughty knight, \rBade bear forth the wounded. Back led they with them then \rUnto the land of Burgundy five hundred stalwart fighting-men. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT WITH THE SAXONS 35 \r\r\r\r220 \rThe knights, of victory cheated, their native Denmark sought, \rNor had that day the Saxons with such high valor fought, \rThat one could praise them for it, which caused the warriors pain. \rThen wept their friends full sorely at home for those in battle slain. \r\r221 \rFor the Rhine then laden they let their armor be. \rSiegfried, the knight so doughty, had won the victory \rWith his few chosen followers; that he had nobly done, \rCould not but free acknowledge King Gunther\'s warriors every one. \r\r222 \rTo Worms sent Gemot riding now a messenger, \rAnd of the joyous tiding soon friends at home were ware, \rHow that it well had prospered with him and all his men. \rFought that day with valor for honor had those warriors keen. \r\r223 \rThe messenger sped forward and told the tidings o\'er. \rThen joyfully they shouted who boded ill before, \rTo hear the welcome story that now to them was told. \rFrom ladies fair and noble came eager questions manifold, \r\r224 \rWho all the fair fortune of King Gunther\'s men would know. \rOne messenger they ordered unto Kriemhild to go. \rBut that was done in secret: she durst let no one see, \rFor he was \'mongst those warriors whom she did love so faithfully. \r\r225 \rWhen to her own apartments was come the messenger \rJoyfully addressed him Kriemhild the maiden fair: \r"But tell me now glad tidings, and gold I\'ll give to thee, \rAnd if thou tell\'st not falsely, good friend thou\'lt ever find in me. \r\r226 \r"How has my good brother Gemot in battle sped, \rAnd how my other kinsmen? Lies any of them dead? \rWho wrought most deeds of valor ? \xc3\x91That shalt thou let me know." \rThen spake the messenger truly: "No knight but did high valor \rshow. \r\r\r\r36 FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r227 \r"But in the dire turmoil rode rider none so well, \rO Princess fair and noble, since I must truly tell, \rAs the stranger knight full noble who comes from Netherland; \rThere deeds of mickle wonder were wrought by doughty Siegfried\'s \rhand. \r\r228 \r"Whate\'er have all the warriors in batde dared to do, \rDankwart and Hagen and the other knights so true, \rHowe\'er they fought for honor, \'twas naught but idle play \rBeside what there wrought Siegfried, King Siegmund\'s son, amid the \rfray. \r\r229 \r"Beneath their hands in battle full many a hero fell, \rYet all the deeds of wonder no man could ever tell, \rWrought by the hand of Siegfried, when rode he \'gainst the foe: \rAnd weep aloud must women for friends by his strong arm laid low. \r\r230 \r"There, too, the knight she loved full many a maid must lose. \rWere heard come down on helmet so loud his mighty blows, \rThat they from gaping gashes brought forth the flowing blood. \rIn all that maketh noble he is a valiant knight and good. \r\r231 \r" Many a deed of daring of Metz Sir Ortwein wrought: \rFor all was evil faring whom he with broadsword caught, \rDoomed to die that instant, or wounded sore to fall. \rAnd there thy valiant brother did greater havoc work than all \r\r232 \r"That e\'er in storm of battle was done by warrior bold. \rOf all those chosen warriors let eke the truth be told: \rThe proud Burgundian heroes have made it now right plain, \rThat they can free from insult their country\'s honor well maintain. \r\r233 \r"Beneath their hands was often full many a saddle bare, \rWhen o\'er the field resounding their bright swords cut the air. \rThe warriors from Rhine river did here such victory win \rThat for their foes \'twere better if they such meeting ne\'er had seen. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT WITH THE SAXONS 37 \r\r\r\r234 \r"Keen the knights of Tronje \'fore all their valor showed, \rWhen with their stalwart followers against their foes they rode; \rSlain by the hand of Hagen must knights so many be, \r\'Twill long be in the telling here in the Land of Burgundy. \r\r235 \r"Sindold and Hunold, Gernot\'s men each one, \rAnd the valiant Rumold have all so nobly done, \rKing Luedeger will ever have right good cause to rue \rThat he against thy kindred at Rhine dared aught of harm to do. \r\r236 \r"And deeds of all most wondrous e\'er done by warrior keen \rIn earliest time or latest, by mortal ever seen, \rWrought there in lusty manner Siegfried with doughty hand. \rRich hostages he bringeth with him unto Gunther\'s land. \r\r237 \r"By his own strength subdued them the hero unsurpassed \rAnd brought down dire ruin upon King Luedegast, \rEke on the King of Saxons his brother Luedeger. \rNow hearken to the story I tell thee, noble Princess fair. \r\r238 \r"Them both hath taken captive Siegfried\'s doughty hand. \rHostages were so many ne\'er brought into this land \rAs to the Rhine come hither through his great bravery." \rThan these could never tidings unto her heart more welcome be. \r\r239 \r"With captives home they\'re hieing, five hundred men or mo\', \rAnd of the wounded dying Lady shalt thou know, \rFull eighty blood-stained barrows unto Burgundian land, \rMost part hewn down in battle beneath keen Siegfried\'s doughty \r\rhand. \r\r240 \r"Who message sent defiant unto the Rhine so late \rMust now as Gunther\'s prisoners here abide their fate. \rBringing such noble captives the victors glad return." \rThen glowed with joy the princess when she the tidings glad did \rlearn. \r\r\r\r38 FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r241 \rHer cheeks so full of beauty with joy were rosy-red, \rThat passed he had uninjured through all the dangers dread, \rThe knight she loved so dearly, Siegfried with doughty arm. \rGood cause she had for joying o\'er all her friends escaped from \rharm. \r\r242 \rThen spake the beauteous maiden: "Glad news thou hast told me, \rWherefor now rich apparel thy goodly meed shall be, \rAnd to thee shall be given ten marks of gold as well." \r\'Tis thus a thing right pleasant to ladies high such news to tell. \r\r243 \rThe presents rich they gave him, gold and apparel rare. \rThen hastened to the casement full many a maiden fair, \rAnd on the street looked downward: hither riding did they see \rMany a knight high-hearted into the land of Burgundy. \r\r244 \rThere came who \'scaped uninjured, and wounded borne along, \rAll glad to hear the greetings of friends, a joyful throng. \rTo meet his friends the monarch rode out in mickle glee: \rIn joying now was ended all his full great anxiety. \r\r245 \rThen did he well his warriors and eke the strangers greet; \rAnd for a king so mighty \'twere nothing else but meet \rThat he should thank right kindly the gallant men each one, \rWho had in storm of battle the victory so bravely won. \r\r246 \rThen of his friends King Gunther bade tidings tell straightway, \rOf all his men how many were fallen in the fray. \rLost had he none other than warriors three score: \rThen wept they for the heroes, as since they did for many more. \r\r247 \rShields full many brought they all hewn by valiant hand, \rAnd many a shattered helmet into King Gunther\'s hand. \rThe riders then dismounted from their steeds before the hall, \rAnd a right hearty welcome from friends rejoicing had they all. __ \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT WITH THE SAXONS 39 \r\r248 \rThen did they for the warriors lodging meet prepare, \rAnd for his guests the monarch bade full well have care. \rHe bade them take the wounded and tend them carefully, \rAnd toward his enemies also his gentle bearing might ye see. \r\r249 \rTo Luedeger then spake he: "Right welcome art thou here. \rThrough fault of thine now have I lost many friends full dear, \rFor which, have I good fortune, thou shalt right well atone. \rGod rich reward my liegemen, such faithfulness to me they\'ve \rshown." \r\r250 \r"Well may\'st thou thank them, truly," spake then Luedeger; \r"Hostages so noble won a monarch ne\'er. \rFor chivalrous protection rich goods we offer thee, \rThat thou now right gracious to us thy enemies shalt be." \r\r251 \r"I\'ll grant you both your freedom," spake the king again; \r\r"But that my enemies surely here by me remain, \r\rTherefor I\'ll have good pledges they ne\'er shall quit my land, \r\rSave at my royal pleasure." Thereto gave Luedeger the hand. \r\r252 \r\rSweet rest then found the weary their tired limbs to aid, \r\rAnd gently soon on couches the wounded knights were laid; \r\rMead and wine right ruddy they poured out plenteously: \r\rThan they and all their followers merrier men there none might be. \r\r253 \rTheir shields all hacked in battle secure were laid away; \r\rAnd not a few of saddles stained with blood that day, \r\rLest women weep to see them, hid they too from sight. \r\rFull many a keen rider home came aweary from the fight. \r\r254 \rThe host in gentlest manner did his guests attend: \rThe land around with stranger was crowded, and with friend. \rThey bade the sorely wounded nurse with especial care : \rWhereby the knights high-hearted \'neath all their wounds knew not \rdespair. \r\r\r\r4 o FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r255 \rWho there had skill in healing received reward untold, \rSilver all unweighed and thereto ruddy gold \rFor making whole the heroes after the battle sore. \rTo all his friends the monarch gave presents rich in goodly store. \r\r256 \rWho there again was minded to take his homeward way \rThey bade, as one a friend doth, yet a while to stay. \rThe king did then take counsel how to reward each one, \rFor they his will in battle like liegemen true had nobly done. \r\r257 \rThen outspake royal Gemot: "Now let them homeward go; \rAfter six weeks are over, \xc3\x91thus our friends shall know- \rTo hold high feast they\'re bidden hither to come again; \rMany a knight now lying sore wounded will be healed ere then. \r\r258 \rOf Netherland the hero would also then take leave. \rWhen of this King Gunther did tidings first receive, \rThe knight besought he kindly not yet his leave to take: \rTo this he\'d ne\'er consented an it were not for Kriemhild\'s sake. \r\r259 \rA prince he was too noble to take the common pay; \rHe had right well deserved it that the king alway \rAnd all his warriors held him in honor, for they had seen \rWhat by his arm in battle bravely had accomplished been. \r\r260 \rHe stayed there yet a little for the maiden\'s sake alone, \rWhom he would see so gladly. And all fell out full soon \rAs he at heart had wished it: well known to him was she. \rHome to his father\'s country joyously anon rode he. \r\r261 \rThe king bade at all seasons keep up the tournament, \rAnd many a youthful rider forth to the lists there went. \rThe while were seats made ready by Worms upon the strand \rFor all who soon were coming unto the Burgundian land. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FIRST SAW KRIEMHILD 41 \r\r262 \rIn the meantime also, ere back the knights returned, \rHad Kriemhild, noble lady, the tidings likewise learned, \rThe king would hold high feasting with all his gallant men. \rThere was a mickle hurry, and busy were fair maidens then \r\r263 \rWith dresses and with wimples that they there should wear. \rUte, queen so stately, the story too did hear, \rHow to them were coming proud knights of highest worth. \rThen from enfolding covers were store of dresses rich brought forth. \r\r264 \rSuch love she bore her children she bade rich dress prepare, \rWherewith adorned were ladies and many a maiden fair, \rAnd not a few young riders in the land of Burgundy. \rFor strangers many bade she rich garments eke should measured be. \r\r\r\rFIFTH ADVENTURE \r1bow SiegfrieO first saw IRriembllD \r\r265 \rUnto the Rhine now daily the knights were seen to ride, \rWho there would be full gladly to share the festive tide. \rTo all that thither journeyed to the king to show them true, \rIn plenty them were given steeds and rich apparel too. \r\r266 \rAnd soon were seats made ready for every noble guest, \rAs we have heard the story, for highest and for best, \rTwo and thirty princes at the festival. \rThen vied with one another to deck themselves the ladies all. \r\r267 \rNever was seen idle the young Prince Giselher: \rThe guests and all their followers received full kindly were \rBy him and eke by Gemot and their men every one. \rThe noble thanes they greeted as ever \'tis in honor done. \r\r\r\rFIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r\xc2\xa1f i . \xc3\x91 - \r\r\r\r268 \rWith gold bright gleaming saddles unto the land they brought, \rGood store of rich apparel and shields all richly wrought \rUnto the Rhine they carried to that high festival. \rAnd joyous days were coming for the wounded warriors all. \r\r269 \rThey who yet on couches lay wounded grievously \rFor joy had soon forgotten how bitter death would be: \rThe sick and all the ailing no need of pity had. _ \rAnent the days of feasting were they o\'er the tidings glad, \r\r270 \rHow they should make them merry there where all were so. \rDelight beyond all measure, of joys an overflow, \rHad in sooth the people seen on every hand: \rThen rose a mickle joyance over all King Gunther s land. \r\r271 \rFull many a warrior valiant one morn at Whitsuntide \rAll gorgeously apparelled was thither seen to ride, \rFive thousand men or over, where the feast should be; \rAnd vied in every quarter knight with knight in revelry. \r\r272 \rThereof the host was mindful, for he well did understand \rHow at heart right warmly the hero of Netherland \rLoved alone his sister, though her he ne\'er had seen \rWho praised for wondrous beauty before all maidens else had been \r\r273 \rThen spake the thane so noble of Metz Sir Ortwem: \r"Wilt thou full be honored by every guest of thine, \rThen do them all the pleasure the winsome maids to see, \rThat are held so high in honor here in the land of Burgundy. \r\r2 74 \r"What were a man\'s chief pleasure, his very joy of life, \rAn \'t were not a lovely maiden or a stately wife?

Straight he who long had borne \rHer in his heart and loved her, from all his gloom was freed, \rAs so stately there before him he saw the fair and lovely maid. \r\r\r\r44 FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r282 \rHer rich apparel glittered with many a precious stone, \rAnd with a ruddy beauty her cheeks like roses shone. \rThough you should wish to do so, you could not say, I ween, \rThat e\'er a fairer lady in all the world before was seen. \r\r283 \rAs in a sky all starlit the moon shines out so bright, \rAnd through the cloudlets peering pours down her gentle light, \rE\'en so was Kriemhild\'s beauty among her ladies fair: \rThe hearts of gallant heroes were gladder when they saw her there. \r\r284 \rThe richly clad attendants moved stately on before, \rAnd the valiant thanes high-hearted stood patiently no more, \rBut pressed right eager forward to see the lovely maid: \rIn noble Siegfried\'s bosom alternate joy and anguish swayed. \r\r285 \rHe thought with heart despairing, "How could it ever be, \rThat I should win thy favor? There hoped I foolishly. \rBut had I e\'er to shun thee, then were I rather dead." \rAnd oft, to think upon it, the color from his visage fled. \r\r286 v \r\rThe noble son of Siegmund did there so stately stand \rAs if his form were pictured by good old master\'s hand \rUpon a piece of parchment. All who saw, confessed^. \rThat he of all good heroes was the stateliest and the best. \r\r287 \rThe fair Kriemhild\'s attendants gave order to make way \rOn all sides for the ladies, and willing thanes obey. \rTo see their noble bearing did every warrior cheer; \rFull many a stately lady of gentle manner born was there. \r\r288 \rThen outspake of Burgundy Gemot the valiant knight: \r"To him who thus has helped thee so bravely in the fight, \rGunther, royal brother, shalt thou like favor show, \rA thane before all others; he\'s worthy of it well, I trow. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FIRST SAW KRIEMHILD 45 \r\r289 \r"Let then the doughty Siegfried unto my sister go \rTo have the maiden\'s greetings, \xc3\x91 \'twill be our profit so. \rShe that ne\'er greeted hero shall greet him courteously, \rThat thus the stately warrior for aye our faithful friend may be." \r\r290 \rThe king\'s knights hastened gladly upon his high command \rAnd told these joyous tidings to the prince of Netherland. \r"It is the king\'s good pleasure that thou to court shalt go, \rTo have his sister\'s greetings; to honor thee \'tis ordered so." \r\r291 \rThen was the thane full valiant thereat soon filled with joy. \rYea, bore he in his bosom delight without alloy \rAt thought that he should straightway Ute\'s fair daughter see. \rSiegfried anon she greeted in courteous manner lovingly. \r\r292 \rAs she saw the knight high-hearted there before her stand, \rBlushed red and spake the maiden, the fairest of the land: \r"A welcome, brave Sir Siegfried, thou noble knight and good." \rAs soon as he had heard it, the hearty greeting cheered his mood. \r\r293 \rBefore her low he bended; him by the hand took she, \r\rAnd by her onward wended the knight full willingly. \r\rThey cast upon each other fond glances many a one, \r\rThe knight and eke the maiden; furtively it all was done. \r\r294 \rWhether he pressed friendly that hand as white as snow \rFrom the love he bore her, that I do not know; \rYet believe I cannot that this was left undone, \rFor straightway showed the maiden that he her heart had fully won. \r\r295 ^ \rIn the sunny summer season and in the month of May \r\rHad his heart seen never before so glad a day, \r\rNor one so fully joyous, as when he walked beside \r\rThat maiden rich in beauty whom fain he\'d choose to be his bride. \r\r\r\rN \r\r\r\r46 FIFTH ADVE NTURE \r\r\r\rThen thought many a warrior: "Were it likewise granted n \r\rTo walk beside the maiden, just as now I see, \r\rOr to lie beside her, how gladly were that done! \r\rBut ne\'er a knight more fully had gracious lady\'s favor wor \r\r297 \rFrom all the lands far distant were guests distinguished the \rBut fixed each eye was only upon this single pair _ \r\rBy royal leave did Kriemhild kiss then the stately knight: \rIn all the world he never before had known so rare delight. \r\r298 \rThen full of strange forebodings, of Denmark spake the kin \r"This full loving greeting to many woe will bring, \r-My heart in secret warns me- through Siegfried s doughty \rGod give that he may never again be seen withm my land. \r\r299 \rOn all sides then \'twas ordered \'fore Kriemhild and her tr \rOf women make free passage. Full many a valiant thar \rWith her unto the minster in courtly way went on. \rBut from her side was parted the full stately kmght anon. \r\r300 \rThen went she to the minster, and with her many a maid. \rIn such rich apparel Kriemhild was arrayed, \rThat hearty wishes many there were made in vain: \rHer comely form delighted the eye of many a noble thane \r\r301 \rScarce could tarry Siegfried till mass was sung the while. \r\\nd surely did Dame Fortune upon him kindly smile, \rTo him she was so gracious whom in his heart he bore. \rEke did he the maiden, as she full well deserved, adore. \r\r302 \rAs after mass then Kriemhild came to the minster door, \rThe knight his homage offered, as he had done before. \rThen began to thank him the full beauteous maid, \rThat he her royal brothers did \'gainst their foes so nobly \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FIRST SAW KRIEMHILD 47 \r\r\r\r3\xc2\xa13 \r"God speed thee, Sir Siegfried," spake the maiden fair, \r"For thou hast well deserved that all these warriors are, \rAs it hath now been told me, right grateful unto thee." \rThen gan he cast his glances on the Lady Kriemhild lovingly. \r\r3\xc2\xa14 \r"True will I ever serve them," \xc3\x91 so spake the noble thane \xc3\x91 \r"And my head shall never be laid to rest again, \rTill I, if life remaineth, have their good favor won. \rIn sooth, my Lady Kriemhild, for thy fair grace it all is done." \r\r3\xc2\xa15 \rNe\'er a day passed over for a twelve of happy days, \rBut saw they there beside him the maiden all did praise, \rAs she before her kinsmen to court would daily go: \rIt pleased the thane full highly, that they did him such honor show. \r\r306 \rDelight and great rejoicing, a mighty jubilee, \rBefore King Gunther\'s castle daily might ye see, \rWithout and eke within it, \'mongst keen men many a one. \rBy Ortwein and by Hagen great deeds and wondrous there were \rdone. \r\r3\xc2\xa17 \rWhate\'er was done by any, in all they ready were \rTo join in way right lusty, both the warriors rare: \rWhereby \'mongst all the strangers they won an honored name, \rAnd through their deeds so wondrous of Gunther\'s land spread far \rthe fame. \r\r308 \rWho erstwhile lay sore wounded now were whole again, \rAnd fain would share the pastime, with all the king\'s good men; \rWith shields join in the combat, and try the shaft so long. \rWherein did join them many of the merry-making throng. \r\r3\xc2\xa19 \rTo all who joined the feasting the host in plenty bade \rSupply the choicest viands: so guarded well\' he had \r\'Gainst whate\'er reproaches could rise from spite or spleen. \rUnto his guests right friendly to go the monarch now was seen. \r\r\r\r4 8 FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r310 \rHe spake: "Ye thanes high-hearted, ere now ye part from me, \rAccept of these my presents; for I would willingly \rRepay your noble service. Despise ye not, I pray, \rWhat now I will share with you: \'tis offered in right grateful way." \r\r311 \rStraightway they of Denmark thus to the king replied: \r\r"Ere now upon our journey home again we ride, \r\rWe long for lasting friendship. Thereof we knights have need, \r\rFor many a well-loved kinsman at hands of thy good thanes lies \r\rdead." \r\r312 \r\rLuedegast was recovered from all his wounds so sore, \r\rAnd eke the lord of Saxons from fight was whole once more. \r\rSome amongst their warriors left they dead behind. \r\rThen went forth King Gunther where he Siegfried might find. \r\r313 \r\rUnto the thane then spake he: "Thy counsel give, I pray. \rThe foes whom we hold captive fain would leave straightway, \rAnd long for lasting friendship with all my men and me. \rNow tell me, good Sir Siegfried, what here seemeth good to thee. \r\r314 \r\r"What the lords bid as ransom, shall now to thee be told \rWhate\'er five hundred horses might bear of ruddy gold, \rThey\'d give to me right gladly, would I but let them free." \rThen spake the noble Siegfried: "That were to do right foolishly. \r\r3i5 \r"Thou shalt let them freely - journey hence again; \rAnd that they both hereafter shall evermore refrain \rFrom leading hostile army against thee and thy land, \rTherefor in pledge of friendship let each now give to thee the hand." \r\r316 \r"Thy rede I\'ll gladly follow." Straightway forth they went. \rTo those who offered ransom the answer then was sent, \rTheir gold no one desired which they would give before. \rThe warriors battle-weary dear friends did yearn to see once more. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FIRST SAW KRIEMHILD 49 \r\r3i7 \rFull many a shield all laden with treasure forth they bore: \rHe dealt it round unmeasured to friends in goodly store; \rEach one had marks five hundred and some had more, I ween. \rTherein King Gunther followed the rede of Gemot, knight full keen. \r\r3i8 \rThen was a great leave-taking, as they departed thence. \rThe warriors all \'fore Kriemhild appeared in reverence, \rAnd eke there where her mother Queen Ute sat near by. \rGallant thanes were never dismissed as these so graciously. \r\r3 J 9 \rBare were the lodging-places, when away the strangers rode. \rYet in right lordly manner there at home abode \rThe king with friends around him, full noble men who were. \rAnd them now saw they daily at court before Kriemhild appear. \r\r320 \rEke would the gallant hero Siegfried thence depart, \rThe thing to gain despairing whereon was set his heart. \rThe king was told the tidings how that he would away. \rGiselher his brother did win the knight with them to stay. \r\r321 \r"Whither, O noble Siegfried, wilt thou now from us ride? \rDo as I earnest pray thee, and with these thanes abide, \rAs guest here with King Gunther, and live right merrily. \rHere dwell fair ladies many: them will he gladly let thee see." \r\r322 \rThen spake the doughty Siegfried: "Our steeds leave yet at rest, \rThe while from this my purpose to part will I desist. \rOur shields once more take from us. Though gladly home I \r\rwould, \rNaught \'gainst the fond entreaties of Giselher avail me could." \r\r323 \rSo stayed the knight full gallant for sake of friendship there. \rIn sooth in ne\'er another country anywhere \rHad he so gladly lingered: iwis it was that he, \rNow whensoe\'er he wished it, Kriemhild the maiden fair could see. \r\r\r\r5 o SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r3 2 4 \r\'Twas her surpassing beauty that made the knight to stay. \rWith many a merry pastime they whiled the time away; \rBut love for her oppressed him, oft-times grievously. \rWhereby anon the hero a mournful death was doomed to die. \r\r\r\rSIXTH ADVENTURE \rDow Guntber farcD to Usenlano to JBrunbllo \r\r325 \rTidings unknown to any from over Rhine now come, \rHow winsome maids a many far yonder had their home. \rWhereof the royal Gunther bethought him one to win, \rAnd o\'er the thought the monarch of full joyous mood was seen. \r\r326 \rThere was a queenly maiden seated over sea, \rLike her nowhere another was ever known to be. \rShe was in beauty matchless, full mickle was her might; \rHer love the prize of contest, she hurled the shaft with valiant \rknight. \r\r3 2 7 \rThe stone she threw far distant, wide sprang thereafter too. \rWho turned to her his fancy with intent to woo, \rThree times perforce must vanquish the lady of high degree; \rFailed he in but one trial, forfeited his head had he. \r\r328 \rThis same the lusty princess times untold had done. \rWhen to a warrior gallant beside the Rhine \'twas known, \rHe thought to take unto him the noble maid for wife: \rThereby must heroes many since that moment lose their life. \r\r329 \rThen spake of Rhine the master: "I\'ll down unto the sea \rUnto Brunhild journey, fare as \'twill with me. \rFor her unmeasured beauty I\'ll gladly risk my life, \rReady eke to lose it, if she may not be my wife." \r\r\r\rHOW GUNTHER FARED TO ISENLAND TO BRUNHILD 51 \r\r"I counsel thee against it," spake then Siegfried. \r\r" So terrible in contest the queen is indeed, \r\rWho for her love is suitor his zeal must dearly pay. \r\rSo shalt thou from the journey truly be content to stay." \r\r33 1 \r"So will I give thee counsel," outspake Hagen there, \r"That thou beg of Siegfried with thee to bear \rThe perils that await thee: that is now my rede, \rTo him is known so fully what with Brunhild will be thy need." \r\r332 \rHe spake: "And wilt thou help me, noble Siegfried, \rTo win the lovely maiden? Do what now I plead; \rAnd if in all her beauty she be my wedded wife, \rTo meet thy fullest wishes honor will I pledge and life." \r\r333 \rThereto answered Siegfried, the royal Siegmund\'s son: \r"Giv\'st thou me thy sister, so shall thy will be done, \r? \xc3\x91 Kriemhild the noble princess, in beauty all before. \rFor toils that I encounter none other meed I ask thee more." \r\r334 \r"That pledge I," spake then Gunther, "Siegfried, in thy hand. \rAnd comes the lovely Brunhild thither to this land, \rThereunto thee my sister for wife I\'ll truly give, \rThat with the lovely maiden thou may\'st ever joyful live." \r\r335 \rOaths the knight full noble upon the compact swore, \rWhereby to them came troubles and dangers all the more, \rEre they the royal lady brought unto the Rhine. \rStill should the warriors valiant in sorest need and sorrow pine. \r\r336 \rWith him carried Siegfried that same mantle then, \rThe which with mickle trouble had won the hero keen \rFrom a dwarf in struggle, Alberich by name. \rThey dressed them for the journey, the valiant thanes of lofty fame. \r\r\r\r5 2 SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r337 \rAnd when the doughty Siegfried the sightless mantle wore, \rHad he within it of strength as good a store \rAs other men a dozen in himself alone. \rThe full stately princess anon by cunning art he won. \r\r338 \rEke had that same mantle such wondrous properties \rThat any man whatever might work whate\'er he please \rWhen once he had it on him, yet none could see or tell. \r\'Twas so that he won Brunhild; whereby him evil since befell. \r\r339 \r"Ere we begin our journey, Siegfried, tell to me, \rThat we with fullest honor come unto the sea, \rShall we lead warriors with us down to Brunhild\'s land? \rThanes a thirty thousand straightway shall be called to hand." \r\r34o \r"Men bring we ne\'er so many," answered Siegfried then. \r"So terrible in custom ever is the queen, \rThat all would death encounter from her angry mood. \rI\'ll give thee better counsel, thane in valor keen and good. \r\r34i \r"Like as knights-errant journey down the Rhine shall we. \rThose now will I name thee who with us shall be; \rBut four in all the company seaward shall we fare: \rThus shall we woo the lady, what fortune later be our share. \r\r342 \r"Myself one of the company, a second thou shalt be, \rHagen be the third one \xc3\x91so fare we happily; \rThe fourth let it be Dankwart, warrior full keen. \rNever thousand others dare in fight withstand us then." \r\r343 \r"The tale I would know gladly," the king then further said, \r"Ere we have parted thither \xc3\x91of that were I full glad\xc3\x91 \rWhat should we of apparel, that would befit us well, \rWear in Brunhild\'s presence: that shalt thou now to Gunther tell. \r\r\r\rHOW GUNTHER FARED TO ISENLAND TO BRUNHILD 53 \r\r344 \r"Weeds the very finest that ever might be found \rThey wear in every season in Brunhild\'s land: \rSo shall we rich apparel before the lady wear, \rThat we have not dishonor where men the tale hereafter hear." \r\r345 \rThen spake he to the other: "Myself will go unto \rMy own loving mother, if I from her may sue \rThat her fair tendant maidens help that we be arrayed \rAs we may go in honor before the high majestic maid." \r\r346 \rThen spake of Tronje Hagen with noble courtliness: \r"Why wilt thou of thy mother beg such services? \rOnly let thy sister hear our mind and mood: \rSo shall for this our journey her good service be bestowed." \r\r347 \rThen sent he to his sister that he her would see, \rAnd with him also Siegfried. Ere that such might be, \rHerself had there the fair one in rich apparel clad. \rSooth to tell, the visit but little did displease the maid. \r\r348 \rThen also were her women decked as for them was meet. \rThe princes both were coming: she rose from off her seat, \rAs doth a high-born lady when that she did perceive, \rAnd went the guest full noble and eke her brother to receive. \r\r349 \r"Welcome be my brother and his companion too. \rI\'d know the story gladly," spake the maiden so, \r"What ye now are seeking that ye are come to me: \rI pray you straightway tell me how \'t with you valiants twain may \rbe." \r\r35\xc2\xa1 \rThen spake the royal Gunther: "Lady, thou shalt hear: \r\rSpite of lofty spirits have we yet a care. \r\rTo woo a maid we travel afar to lands unknown; \r\rWe should against the journey have rich apparel for our own." \r\r\r\r54 SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r35i \r"Seat thee now, dear brother," spake the princess fair; \r"Let me hear the story, who the ladies are \rThat ye will seek as suitors in stranger princes\' land." \rBoth good knights the lady took in greeting by the hand. \r\r352 \rWith the twain then went she where she herself had sat, \rTo couches rich and costly, in sooth believe ye that, \rWrought in design full cunning of gold embroidery. \rAnd with these fair ladies did pass the time right pleasantly. \r\r353 \rMany tender glances and looks full many a one \rFondly knight and lady each other cast upon. \rWithin his heart he bore her, she was as his own life. \rAnon the fairest Kriemhild was the doughty Siegfried\'s wife. \r\r354 \rThen spake the mighty monarch: "Full loving sister mine, \rThis may we ne\'er accomplish without help of thine. \rUnto Brunhild\'s country as suitor now we fare: \r\'Tis fitting that \'fore ladies we do rich apparel wear." \r\r355 \rThen spake the royal maiden: "Brother dear to me, \rIn whatsoever manner my help may given be, \rOf that I well assure you, ready thereto am I. \rTo Kriemhild \'twere a sorrow if any should the same deny. \r\r356 \r"Of me, O noble brother, thou shalt not ask in vain: \rCommand in courteous manner and I will serve thee fain. \rWhatever be thy pleasure, for that I\'ll lend my aid \rAnd willingly I\'ll do it," spake the fair and winsome maid. \r\r357 \r"It is our wish, dear sister, apparel good to wear; \rThat shall now directing the royal hand prepare; \rAnd let thy maids see to it that all is done aright, ^ \r\rFor we from this same journey turn not aside for word of wight. \r\r\r\rHOW GUNTHER FARED TO ISENLAND TO BRUNHILD 55 \r\r358 \rSpake thereupon the maiden: "Now mark ye what I say: \rMyself have silks in plenty; now send us rich supply \rOf stones borne on bucklers, so vesture we\'ll prepare." \rTo do it royal Gunther and Siegfried both right ready were. \r\r359 \r"And who are your companions," further questioned she, \r"Who with you apparelled now for court shall be?" \r"I it is and Siegfried, and of my men are two, \rDankwart and Hagen, who with us to court shall go. \r\r360 \r"Now rightly what we tell thee, mark, O sister dear: \r\'Tis that we four companions for four days may wear \rThrice daily change of raiment so wrought with skilful hand \rThat we without dishonor may take our leave of Brunhild\'s land." \r\r361 \rAfter fair leave-taking the knights departed so. \rThen of her attendants thirty maids to go \rForth from her apartments Kriemhild the princess bade, \rOf those that greatest cunning in such skilful working had. \r\r362 \rThe silks that were of Araby white as the snow in sheen, \rAnd from the land of Zazamank like unto grass so green, \rWith stones of price they broidered; that made apparel rare. \rHerself she cut them, Kriemhild the royal maiden debonair. \r\r363 \rFur linings fashioned fairly from dwellers in the sea \rBeheld by people rarely, the best that e\'er might be, \rWith silken stuffs they covered for th^knights to wear. \rNow shall ye of the shining weeds im Any a wonder hear. \r\r364 ; W \r\rFrom land of far Morocco and eke from Libya \r\rOf silks the very finest that ever mortal saw \r\rWith any monarch\'s kindred, they had a goodly store. \r\rWell showed the Lady Kriemhild that unto them good will she bore. \r\r\r\r5 6 SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r36S \rSince they unto the journey had wished that so it be, \rSkins of costly ermine used they lavishly, \rWhereon were silken pieces black as coal inlaid. \rTo-day were any nobles in robes so fashioned well arrayed. \r\r366 \rFrom the gold of Araby many a stone there shone. \rThe women long were busy before the work was done; \rBut all the robes were finished ere seven weeks did pass, \rWhen also trusty armor for the warriors ready was. \r\r367 \rWhen they at length were ready adown the Rhine to fare, \rA ship lay waiting for them strong built with mickle care, \rWhich should bear them safely far down unto the sea. \rThe maidens rich in beauty plied their work laboriously. \r\r368 \rThen \'twas told the warriors for them was ready there \rThe finely wrought apparel that they were to wear; \rJust as they had wished it, so it had been made; \rAfter that the heroes there by the Rhine no longer stayed. \r\r369 \rTo the knights departing went soon a messenger: \rWould they come in person to view their new attire, \rIf it had been fitted short and long aright. \r\r\'Twas found of proper measure, and thanked those ladies fair each \rknight. \r\r37o \rAnd all who there beheld them they must needs confess \rThat in the world they never had gazed on fairer dress: \rAt court to wear th\' aj^jel did therefore please them well. \r\rOf warriors better fuMslSL never could a mortal tell. \r\r37i \rThanks oft-times repeated were there not forgot. \rLeave of parting from them the noble knights then sought: \rLike thanes of noble bearing they went in courteous wise. \rThen dim and wet with weeping grew thereat two shining eyes. \r\r\r\rHOW GUNTHER FARED TO ISENLAND TO BRUNHILD 57 \r\r372 \rShe spake: "O dearest brother, still here thou mightest stay, \rAnd woo another woman \xc3\x91 that were the better way \xc3\x91 \rWhere so sore endangered stood not thus thy life. \rHere nearer canst thou find thee equally a high-born wife." \r\r373 \rI ween their hearts did tell them what later came to pass. \rThey wept there all together, whatever spoken was. \rThe gold upon their bosoms was sullied \'neath the tears \rThat from their eyes in plenty fell adown amid their fears. \r\r374 \rShe spake: "O noble Siegfried, to thee commended be \rUpon thy truth and goodness the brother dear to me, \rThat he come unscathed home from Brunhild\'s land." \rThat plighted the full valiant knight in Lady Kriemhild\'s hand. \r\r375 \rThe mighty thane gave answer: "If I my life retain, \rThen shall thy cares, good Lady, all have been in vain. \rAll safe I\'ll bring him hither again unto the Rhine, \rBe that to thee full sicker." To him did the fair maid incline. \r\r376 \rTheir shields of golden color were borne unto the strand, \xc3\x87 \rAnd all their trusty armor was ready brought to hand. \rThey bade their horses bring them: they would at last depart. \r\xc3\x91 Thereat did fairest women weep with sad foreboding heart. \r\r377 \rDown from lofty casement looked many a winsome maid, \rAs ship and sail together by stirring breeze were swayed. \rUpon the Rhine they found them, the warriors full of pride. \rThen outspake King Gunther: "Who now is here the ship to \rguide?" * \r\r378 \r"That will I," spake Siegfried; "I can upon the flood \rLead you on in safety, that know ye, heroes good; \rFor all the water highways are known right well to me." \rWith joy they then departed from the land of Burgundy. \r\r\r\r5 8 SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r379 \rA mighty pole then grasped he, Siegfried the doughty man, \rAnd the ship from shore forth to shove began. \rGunther the fearless also himself took oar in hand. \rThe knights thus brave and worthy took departure from the land. \r\r380 \rThey carried rich provisions, thereto the best of wine \rThat might in any quarter be found about the Rhine. \rTheir chargers stood in comfort and rested by the way: \rThe ship it moved so lightly that naught of injury had they. \r\r381 \rStretched before the breezes were the great sail-ropes tight, \rAnd twenty miles they journeyed ere did come the night, \rBy fair breezes favored down toward the sea. \rTheir toil repaid thereafter the dauntless knights full grievously. \r\r382 \rUpon the twelfth morning, as we in story hear, \rHad they by the breezes thence been carried far, \rUnto Castle Isenstein and Brunhild\'s country: \rThat to Siegfried only was known of all the company. \r\r383 \rAs toon as saw King Gunther so many towers rise \rAnd eke the boundless marches stretch before his eyes, \rHe spake: "Tell me, friend Siegfried, is it known to thee \rWhose they are, the castles and the majestic broad country? " \r\r384 \rThereto gave answer Siegfried: "That well to me is known: \rBrunhild for their mistress do land and people own \rAnd Isenstein\'s firm towers, as ye have heard me say. \rLadies fair a many shall ye here behold to-day. \r\r385 \r"And I will give you counsel: be it well understood \rThat all your words must tally \xc3\x91 so methinks \'twere good. \rIf ere to-day is over our presence she command, \rMust we leave pride behind us, as before Brunhild we stand. \r\r\r\rHOW GUNTHER FARED TO ISENLAND TO B RUNHILD 59 \r\r386 \r"When we the lovely lady \'mid her retainers see, \rThen shall ye, good companions, in all your speech agree \rThat Gunther is my master and I his serving-man: \r\'Tis thus that all he hopeth shall we in the end attain." \r\r3S7 \rTo do as he had bidden consented straight each one, \rAnd spite of proudest spirit they left it not undone. \rAll that he wished they promised, and good it proved to be \rWhen anon King Gunther the fair Brunhild came to see. \r\r388 \r"Not all to meet thy wishes do I such service swear, \rBut most \'tis for thy sister, Kriemhild the maiden fair; \rJust as my soul unto me she is my very life, \rAnd fain would I deserve it that she in truth become my wife." \r\r\r\rSEVENTH ADVENTURE \r1bow (Suntber won aScunbilD \r\r389 \rThe while they thus did parley their ship did forward glide \rSo near unto the castle that soon the king espied \rAloft within the casements many a maiden fair to see. \rThat all to him were strangers thought King Gunther mournfully. \r\r39o \rHe asked then of Siegfried, who bare him company: \r"Know\'st thou aught of the maidens, who the same may be, \rGazing yonder downward upon us on the tide? \rHowe\'er is named their master, minded are they high in pride." \r\r39 1 \rThen spake the valiant Siegfried: "Now thither shalt thou spy \rUnseen among the ladies, then not to me deny \rWhich, wert thou free in choosing, thou\'dst take to be thy queen." \r"That will I do," then answered Gunther the valiant knight and \rkeen. \r\r\r\r60 SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r392 . \r"I see there one among them by yonder casement stand, \rClad in snow-white raiment: \'tis she my eyes demand, \rSo buxom she in stature, so fair she is to see. \rAn I were free in choosing, she it is my wife must be." \r\r393 \r"Full well now in choosing thine eyes have guided thee: \rIt is the stately Brunhild the maiden fair to see, \rThat doth now unto her thy heart and soul compel." \rAll the maiden\'s bearing pleased the royal Gunther well. \r\r394 \rBut soon the queen commanded from casement all to go \rOf those her beauteous maidens: they should not stand there so \rTo be gazed at by the strangers. They must obey her word. \rWhat were the ladies doing, of that moreover have we heard. \r\r395 \rUnto the noble strangers their beauty they would show, \rA thing which lovely women are ever wont to do. \rUnto the narrow casements came they crowding on, \rWhen they spied the strangers : that they might also see, \'twas done. \r\r396 \rBut four the strangers numbered, who came unto that land. \rSiegfried the doughty the king\'s steed led in hand: \rThey saw it from the casements, many a lovely maid, \rAnd saw the willing service unto royal Gunther paid. \r\r397 \rThen held he by the bridle for him his gallant steed, \rA good and fair-formed charger, strong and of noble breed, \rUntil the royal Gunther into the saddle sprung. \rThus did serve him Siegfried: a service all forgot ere long. \r\r398 \rThen his own steed he also led forth upon the shore. \rSuch menial service had he full seldom done before, \rThat he should hold the stirrup for monarch whomsoe\'er. \rDown gazing from the casements beheld it ladies high and fair. \r\r\r\rHOW GUNTHER WON BRUNHILD 61 \r\r399 \rAt every point according, the heroes well bedight \r\xc3\x91 Their dress and eke their chargers of color snowy white \xc3\x91 \rWere like unto each other, and well-wrought shield each one \rOf the good knights bore with him, that brightly glimmered in the \rsun. \r\r400 \rJewelled well was saddle and narrow martingale \rAs they rode so stately in front of Brunhild\'s Hall, \rAnd thereon bells were hanging of red gold shining bright. \rSo came they to that country, as fitting was for men of might, \r\r401 \rWith spears all newly polished, with swords, well-made that were \rAnd by the stately heroes hung down unto the spur: \rSuch bore the valiant riders of broad and cutting blade. \rThe noble show did witness Brunhild the full stately maid. \r\r402 \rWith him came then Dankwart and Hagen, doughty thane. \rThe story further telleth how that the heroes twain \rOf color black as raven rich attire wore, \rAnd each a broad and mighty shield of rich adornment bore. \r\r403 \rRich stones from India\'s country every eye could see, \rImpending on their tunics, sparkle full brilliantly. \rTheir vessel by the river they left without a guard, \rAs thus the valiant heroes rode undaunted castleward. \r\r404 \rSix and fourscore towers without they saw rise tall, \rThree spacious palaces and moulded well a hall \rAll wrought of precious marble green as blade of grass, \rWherein the royal Brunhild with company of fair ladies was. \r\r405 \rThe castle doors unbolted were flung open wide \rAs out toward them the men of Brunhild hied \rAnd received the strangers into their Lady\'s land. \rTheir steeds they bade take over, and also shield from out the hand. \r\r\r\r62 SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r406 \rThen spake a man-in-waiting: "Give o\'er the sword each thane, \rAnd eke the shining armor."- " Good friend, thou ask\'st in vain, \rSpake of Tronje Hagen; "the same we\'d rather wear." \rThen gan straightway Siegfried the country\'s custom to declare. \r\r407 \r" \'Tis wont within this castle, \xc3\x91of that be now aware\xc3\x91 \rThat never any stranger weapons here shall bear. \rNow let them hence be carried: well dost thou as I say." \rIn this did full unwilling Hagen, Gunther\'s man, obey. \r\r408 \rThey bade the strangers welcome with drink and fitting rest. \rSoon might you see on all sides full many knights the best \rIn princely weeds apparelled to their reception go: \rYet did they mickle gazing who would the keen new-comers know. \r\r409 \rThen unto Lady Brunhild the tidings strange were brought \rHow that unknown warriors now her land had sought, \rIn stately apparel come sailing o\'er the sea. _ \r\rThe maiden fair and stately gave question how the same might be. \r\r410 \r"Now shall ye straight inform me," spake she presently, \r"Who so unfamiliar these warrior knights may be, \rThat within my castle thus so lordly stand, \rAnd for whose sake the heroes have hither journeyed to my land. \r\r411 \rThen spake to her a servant: "Lady, I well can say \rOf them I\'ve ne\'er seen any before this present day: \rBe it not that one among them is like unto Siegfried. \rHim give a goodly welcome: so is to thee my loyal rede. \r\r412 \r"The next of the companions he is a worthy knight: \rIf that were in his power he well were king of might \rO\'er wide domains of princes, the which might reach his hand. \rNow see him by the others so right majestically stand. \r\r\r\r, HOW GUNTHER WON B RUNHILD 63 \r\r413 \r\'The third of the companions, that he\'s a man of spleen \r\xc3\x91Withal of fair-formed body, know thou, stately Queen \xc3\x91 \rDo tell his rapid glances that dart so free from him. \rHe is m all his thinking a man, I ween, of mood full grim. \r\r414 \r"The youngest one among them he is a worthy knight: \rAs modest as a maiden, I see the thane of might \rGoodly in his bearing standing so fair to see, \rWe all might fear if any affront to him should offered be. \r\r415 \r\'\'How blithe soe\'er his manner, how fair soe\'er is he, \rWell could he cause of sorrow to stately woman be \rIf he gan show his anger. In him may well be seen \rHe is in knightly virtues a thane of valor bold and keen." \r\r416 \rThen spake the queen in answer: "Bring now my robes to hand. \rAnd is the mighty Siegfried come unto this land \rFor love of me brought thither, he pays it with his life \rI fear him not so sorely that I e\'er become his wife." \r\r417 \rSo was fair Brunhild straightway well arrayed \rThen went with her thither full many a beauteous maid, \rA hundred good or over, bedight right merrily. \rThe full beauteous maidens would those stranger warriors see. \r\r418 \rAnd with them went the warriors there of Isenland \rThe knights attending Brunhild, who bore sword in hand \rFive hundred men or over. Scarce heart the strangers kept \rAs those knights brave and seemly down from out the saddle leapt. \r\r419 \rWhen the royal lady Siegfried espied, \rNow mote ye willing listen what there the maiden said. \r\rWelcome be thou, Siegfried, hither unto this land \rWhat meaneth this thy journey, gladly might I understand " \r\r\r\r6 4 SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r420 \r"Full mickle do I thank thee, my Lady, high Brunhild, \rThat thou art pleased to greet me, noble Princess mild, \rBefore this knight so noble, who stands before me here: \rFor he is my master, whom first to honor fitting were. \r\r421 \r"Born is he of Rhineland: what need I say more? \rFor thee \'tis highest favor that we do hither fare. \rThee will he gladly marry, an bring that whatsoe\'er. \rBetimes shalt thou bethink thee: my master will thee never spare. \r\r422 \r"For his name is Gunther and he a mighty king. \rIf he thy love hath won him, more wants, he not a thing. \rIn sooth the king so noble hath bade me hither fare: \rAnd gladly had I left it, might I to thwart his wishes dare." \r\r423 \rShe spake: "Is he thy master and thou his vassal art, \rSome games to him I offer, and dare he there take part, \rAnd comes he forth the victor, so am I then his wife: \rAnd be it I that conquer, then shall ye forfeit each his fife." \r\r424 \rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "Lady, let us see \rThy games so fraught with peril. Before should yield to thee \rGunther my master, that well were something rare. \rHe trows he yet is able to win a maid so passing fair." \r\r425 \r"Then shall ye try stone-putting, and follow up the cast, \rAnd the spear hurl with me. Do ye naught here in haste. \rFor well may ye pay forfeit with honor eke and life : \rBethink ye thus full calmly," spake she whom Gunther would foi \rwife. \r\r426 \rSiegfried the valiant stepped unto the king, \rAnd bade him speak out freely his thoughts upon this thing \rUnto the queen so wayward, he might have fearless heart. \r"For to well protect thee from her do I know an art." \r\r\r\rHOW GUNTHER WON BRUNHILD 65 \r\r\r\r427 \rThen spake the royal Gunther: "Now offer, stately Queen, \rWhat play soe\'er thou mayest. And harder had it been, \rYet would I all have ventured for all thy beauty\'s sake. \rMy head I\'ll willing forfeit or thyself my wife I\'ll make." \r\r428 \rWhen therefore the Queen Brunhild heard how the matter stood \rThe play she begged to hasten, as indeed she should. \rShe bade her servants fetch her therefor apparel trim, \rA mail-coat ruddy golden and shield well wrought from boss to rim. \r\r429 \rA battle-tunic silken the maid upon her drew, \rThat in ne\'er a contest weapon pierced through, \rOf skins from land of Libya, and structure rare and fine; \rAnd brilliant bands embroidered might you see upon it shine. \r\r43\xc2\xa1 \rMeanwhile were the strangers jibed with many a threat; \rDankwart and Hagen, their hearts began to beat. \rHow here the king should prosper were they of doubtful mood, \rThinking, "This our journey shall bring us wanderers naught of \rgood." \r\r43 1 \rThe while did also Siegfried the thane beyond compare, \rBefore \'twas marked by any, unto the ship repair, \rWhere he found his sightless mantle * that did hidden he, \rAnd slipped into \'t full deftly: so was he veiled from every eye. \r\r43 2 \rThither back he hied him and .found great company \rAbout the queen who ordered what the high play should be. \rThere went he all in secret; so cunningly \'twas done, \rOf all around were standing perceived him never any one. \r\r433 \rThe ring it was appointed wherein the play should be \r\'Fore many a keen warrior who the same should see. \rMore than seven hundred were seen their weapons bear, \rThat whoso were the victor they might sure the same declare. \r\r* See strophe 97, note. \r\r\r\r66 SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r434 \rThither was come Brunhild; all armed she did stand \rLike as she were to combat for many a royal land; \rUpon her silken tunic were gold bars many a one, \rAnd glowing \'mid the armor her flesh of winsome color shone. \r\r435 \rThen followed her attendants and with them thither brought \rAt once a shield full stately, of pure red gold \'twas wrought, \rWith steel-hard bands for facings, full mickle \'twas and broad, \rWherewith in the contest would guard herself the lovely maid. \r\r436 \rTo hold the shield securely a well-wrought band there was, \rWhereOn lay precious jewels green as blade of grass. \rFull many a ray their lustre shot round against the gold. \rHe were a man full valiant whom this high dame should worthy hold. \r\r437 \rThe shield was \'neath the boss-point, as to us is said, \rGood three spans in thickness, which should bear the maid. \rOf steel \'twas wrought so richly and had of gold such share, \rThat chamberlain and fellows three the same scarce could bear. \r\r438 \rWhen the doughty Hagen the shield saw thither brought, \rSpake the knight of Tronje, and savage was his thought: \r"Where art thou now, King Gunther? Shall we thus lose our life \rWhom here thou seekst for lover, she is the very Devil\'s wife." \r\r439 \rList more of her apparel; she had a goodly store. \rOf silk of Azagang a tunic made she wore, \rAll bedight full richly; amid its color shone \rForth from the queen it covered, full many a sparkling preciou \r\rstone. \r\r440 \rThen brought they for the lady, large and heavy there, \rAs she was wont to hurl it, a sharply-pointed spear; \rStrong and massive was it, huge and broad as well, \rAnd at both its edges it cut with devastation fell. \r\r\r\rHOW GUNTHER WON BRUNHILD 67 \r\r\r\r441 \rTo know the spear was heavy list ye wonders more : \rThree spears of common measure \'twould make, and something o\'er. \rOf Brunhild\'s attendants three scarce the same could bear. \rThe heart of noble Gunther thereat began to fill with fear. \r\r442 \rWithin his soul he thought him: "What pickle am I in? \rOf hell the very Devil, how might he save his skin? \rMight I at home in Burgundy safe and living be, \rShould she for many a season from proffered love of mine be free." \r\r443 \rThen spake Hagen\'s brother the valiant Dankwart: \r"In truth this royal journey doth sorely grieve my hearty \rWe passed for good knights one time: what caitiff\'s death, if we \rHere in far-off country a woman\'s game are doomed to be! \r\r444 \r"It rueth me full sorely that I came to this land. \rAnd had my brother Hagen his good sword in hand, \rAnd had I mine to help him, a bit more gently then, \rA little tame of spirit, might show themselves all Brunhild\'s men. \r\r445 \r"And know it of a certain to lord it thus they\'d cease; \rE\'en though oaths a thousand I\'d sworn to keep the peace, \rBefore that I\'d see perish my dear lord shamefully, \rAmid the souls departed this fair maid herself should be." \r\r446 \r"Well should we unhampered quit at last this land," \rSpake his brother Hagen, "did we in armor stand, \rSuch as we need for battle, and bore we broadswords good: \r\'Twould be a little softened, this doughty lady\'s haughty mood." \r\r447 \rWell heard the noble maiden what the warriors spoke. \rBack athwart her shoulder she sent a smiling look: \r\' \' Now thinks he him so valiant, so let them armed stand ; \rTheir full keen-edged broadswords give the warriors each in hand." \r\r\r\r68 SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r448 \rWhen they their swords received, as the maiden said, \rThe full valiant Dankwart with joy his face grew red. \r"Now play they what them pleaseth," cried the warrior brave; \r"Gunther is yet a freeman, since now in hand good swords we \rhave." \r\r449 \rThe royal Brunhild\'s prowess with terror was it shown. \r\rInto the ring they bore her in sooth a ponderous stone, \r\rGreat and all unwieldy, huge it was and round: \r\rAnd scarce good knights a dozen together raised it from the ground. \r\r45\xc2\xa1 \rTo put this was her custom after trial with the spear. \rThereat the men of Burgundy began to quake with fear. \r"Alack! Alack!"\' quoth Hagen, "what seeks the king for bride? \rBeneath in hell \'twere better the Devil had her by his side!" \r\r45 1 \rOn her white arms the flowing sleeves she backward flung, \rThen with grasp of power the shield in hand she swung, \rAnd spear poised high above her. So did the contest start. \rGunther and Siegfried saw Brunhild\'s ire with falling heart. \r\r45 2 \rAnd were it not that Siegfried a ready help did bring, \rSurely then had perished beneath her hand the king. \rThere went he unperceived and the king\'s hand did touch. \rGunther at his cunning artifice was troubled much. \r\r453 \r"What is that hath touched me?" thought the monarch keen. \rThen gazed he all around him: none was there to be seen. \rA voice spake: "Siegfried is it, a friend that holds thee dear. \rBefore this royal maiden shall thy heart be free from fear. \r\r454 \r"Thy shield in hand now give me and leave it me to bear, \rAnd do thou rightly mark thee what thou now shalt hear. \rNow make thyself the motions, \xc3\x91 the power leave to me." \rWhen he did know him rightly, the monarch\'s heart was filled with \rglee. \r\r\r\rHOW GUNTHER WON BRUNHILD 69 \r\r\r\r455 \r"Now secret keep my cunning, let none e\'er know the same: \rThen shall the royal maiden here find but little game \rOf glory to win from thee, as most to her is dear. \rBehold now how the lady stands before thee void of fear." \r\r456 \rThe spear the stately maiden with might and main did wield, \rAnd huge and broad she hurled it upon the new-made shield, \rThat on his arm did carry the son of Siegelind; \rFrom the steel the sparks flew hissing as if were blowing fierce the \rwind. \r\r457 \rThe mighty spear sharp-pointed full through the shield did crash, \rThat ye from off the mail-rings might see the lightning flash. \rBeneath its force they stumbled, did both those men of might; \rBut for the sightless mantle they both were killed there outright. \r\r458 \rFrom mouth of the full doughty Siegfried burst the blood. \rFull soon he yet recovered; then seized the warrior good \rThe spear that from her strong arm thus his shield had rent, \rAnd back with force as came it the hand of doughty Siegfried sent. \r\r459 \rHe thought- "To pierce the maiden were but small glory earned," \rAnd so the spear\'s sharp edges backward pointing turned; \rAgainst her mail-clad body he made the shaft to bound, \rAnd with such might he sent it full loud her armor did resound. \r\r460 \rThe sparks as if in stormwind from mail-rings flew around. \rSo mightily did hurl it the son of Siegmund \rThat she with all her power could not the shaft withstand \rIn sooth it ne\'er was speeded so swiftly by King Gunther s hand. \r\r461 \rBut to her feet full sudden had sprung Brunhild fair. \r"A shot, O noble Gunther, befitting hero rare." \rShe weened himself had done it, and all unaided he, \rNor wot she one far mightier was thither come so secretly. \r\r\r\r7 o SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r462 \rThen did she go full sudden, wrathful was her mood, \rA stone full high she heaved the noble maiden good, \rAnd the same far from her with might and main she swung: \rHer armor\'s mail-rings jingled as she herself thereafter sprung. \r\r463 \rThe stone, when it had fallen, lay fathoms twelve from there, \rAnd yet did spring beyond it herself the maiden fair. \rThen where the stone was lying thither Siegfried went: \rGunther feigned to move it, but by another arm \'twas sent. \r\r464 \rA valiant man was Siegfried full powerful and tall. \rThe stone then cast he farther, and farther sprang withal. \rFrom those his arts so cunning had he of strength such store \rThat as he leaped he likewise the weight of royal Gunther bore. \r\r465 \rAnd when the leap was ended and faUen was the stone, \rThen saw they ne\'er another but Gunther alone. \rBrunhild the fair maiden, red grew she in wrath: \rSiegfried yet had warded from royal Gunther surest death. \r\r466 \rUnto her attendants she spake in loud command, \rWhen she saw \'cross the circle the king unvanquished stand. \r"Come hither quick, my kinsmen, and ye that wait on me; \rHenceforth unto Gunther shall all be pledged faithfully." \r\r467 \rThen laid the knights full valiant their swords from out the hand; \rAt feet \'fore mighty Gunther from Burgundian land \rOffered himself in service full many a valiant knight. \rThey weened that he had conquered in trial by his proper might. \r\r468 \rHe gave her loving greeting, right courteous was he. \rThen by the hand she took him, the maiden praiseworthy, \rIn pledge that all around him was his to have and hold. \rWhereat rejoiced Hagen the warrior valorous and bold. \r\r\r\rHOW GUNTHER WON BRUNHILD 71 \r\r\r\r469 \rInto the spacious palace with her thence to go \rBade she the noble monarch. When they had done so, \rThen still greater honors unto the knight were shown. \rDankwart and Hagen, right willingly they saw it done. \r\r470 \rSiegfried the valiant, by no means was he slow, \rHis sightless mantle did he away in safety stow. \rThen went he again thither where many a lady sat. \rHe spake unto the monarch\xc3\x91 full cunningly was done all that: \r\r47i \r"Why bidest thus, my master? Wilt not the play begin, \rTo which so oft hath challenged thee the noble queen? \rLet us soon have example what may the trial be." \rAs knew he naught about it, did the knight thus cunningly. \r\r472 \rThen spake the queen unto him: "How hath this ever been, \rThat of the play, Sir Siegfried, nothing thou hast seen, ^ \rWherein hath been the victor Gunther with mighty hand?" \rThereto gave answer Hagen a grim knight of Burgundian land. \r\r473 \rSpake he: "There dost thou, Lady, think ill without a cause: \rBy the ship down yonder the noble Siegfried was, \rThe while the lord of Rhineland in play did vanquish thee: \rThus knows he nothing of it," spake Gunther\'s warrior courteously. \r\r474 \r"A joy to me these tidings," the doughty Siegfried spoke, \r"That so thy haughty spirit is brought beneath the yoke, \rAnd that yet one there liveth master to be of thine. \rNow shalt thou, noble maiden, us follow thither to the Rhine." \r\r475 \rThen spake the maiden shapely: "It may not yet be so. \rAll my men and kindred first the same must know. \rIn sooth not all so lightly can I quit my home. \rFirst must I bid my trusty warriors that they hither come." \r\r\r\r72 SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r476 \rThen bade she messengers quickly forth to ride, \rAnd summoned in her kindred and men from every side. \rWithout delay she prayed them to come to Isenstein, \rAnd bade them all be given fit apparel rare and fine. \r\r_ 477 \rThen might ye see daily \'twixt morn and eventide \rUnto Brunhild\'s castle many a knight to ride. \r"God wot, God wot," quoth Hagen, "we do an evil thing, \rTo tarry here while Brunhild doth thus her men together bring. \r\r478 \r"If now into this country their good men they\'ve brought \r\xc3\x91 What thing the queen intendeth thereof know we naught: \rBelike her wrath ariseth, and we are men forlorn \xc3\x91 \rThen to be our ruin were the noble maiden born." \r\r479 \rThen spake the doughty Siegfried: " That matter leave to me. \rWhereof thou now art fearful, I\'ll never let it be. \rReady help I\'ll bring thee hither unto this land, \rKnights of whom thou wotst not till now I\'ll bring, a chosen band. \r\r480 \r"Of me shalt thou ask not: from hence will I fare. \rMay God of thy good honor meanwhile have a care. \rI come again right quickly with a thousand men for thee, \rThe very best of warriors hitherto are known to me." \r\r481 \r"Then tarry not unduly," thus the monarch said. \r"Glad we are full fairly of this thy timely aid." \rHe spake: "Till I come to thee full short shall be my stay. \rThat thou thyself hast sent me shalt thou unto Brunhild say." \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FARED TO HIS KNIGHTS 73 \r\rEIGHTH ADVENTURE \rIbow Siegfrfeo faced to bis Ifcnfgbte, tbc IKUbelunfien \r\r482 \rThence went then Siegfried out through the castle door \rIn his sightless mantle to a boat upon the shore. \rAs Siegmund\'s son doth board it him no mortal sees; \rAnd quickly off he steers it as were it wafted by the breeze. \r\r483 \rNo one saw the boatman, yet rapid was the flight \rOf the boat forth speeding driven by Siegfried\'s might. \rThey weened that did speed it a swiftly blowing wind: \rNo, \'twas Siegfried sped it, the son of fairest Siegelind. \r\r484 \rIn that one day-time and the following night \rCame he to a country by dint of mickle might, \rLong miles a hundred distant, and something more than this: \rThe Nibelungen were its people where the mighty hoard was his. \r\r485 \rAlone did fare the hero unto an island vast \rWhereon the boat full quickly the gallant knight made fast. \rOf a castle then bethought him high upon a hill, \rAnd there a lodging sought him, as wayworn men are wont to still. \r\r486 \rThen came he to the portals that locked before him stood. \rThey guarded well their honor as people ever should. \rAt the door he gan a-knocking, for all unknown was he. \rBut full well \'twas guarded, and within it he did see \r\r487 \rA giant who the castle did guard with watchful eye, \rAnd near him did at all times his good weapons he. \rQuoth he: "Who now that knocketh at the door in such strange \r\rwise?" \rWithout the valiant Siegfried did cunningly his voice disguise. \r\r\r\r74 EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r488 \rHe spake: "A bold knight-errant am I; unlock the gate. \rElse will I from without here disturbance rare create \rFor all who\'d fain he quiet and their rest would take." \rWrathful grew the Porter as in this wise Siegfried spake. \r\r489 \rNow did the giant valorous his good armor don, \rAnd placed on head his helmet; then the full doughty man \rHis shield up-snatched quickly and gate wide open swung. \rHow sore was he enraged as himself upon Siegfried he flung! \r\r490 \r\'How dared he thus awaken brave knights within the hall?\' \rThe blows in rapid showers from his hand did fall. \rThereat the noble stranger began himself to shield. \rFor so a club of iron the Porter\'s mighty arm did wield, \r\r491 \rThat splinters flew from buckler, and Siegfried stood aghast \rFrom fear that this same hour was doomed to be his last, \rSo mightily the Porter\'s blows about him fell. \rTo find such faithful warder did please his master Siegfried well \r\r492 \rSo fiercely did they struggle that castle far within \rAnd hall where slept the Nibelungen echoed back the din. \rBut Siegfried pressed the Porter and soon he had him bound. \rIn all the land of Nibelungen the story soon was bruited round. \r\r493 \rWhen the grim sound of fighting afar the place had filled, \rAlberich did hear it, a Dwarf full brave and wild. \rHe donned his armor deftly, and running thither found \rThis so noble stranger where he the doughty Porter bound. \r\r494 \rAlberich was full wrathy, thereto a man of power. \rCoat of mail and helmet he on his body wore, \rAnd in his hand a heavy scourge of gold he swung. \rWhere was fighting Siegfried, thither in mickle haste he sprung. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FARED TO HIS KNIGHTS 75 \r\r\r\r495 \rSeven knobs thick and heavy on the club\'s end were seen, \rWherewith the shield that guarded the knight that was so keen \rHe battered with such vigor that pieces from it brake. \rLest he his life should forfeit the noble stranger gan to quake. \r\r496 \rThe shield that all was battered from his hand he flung; \rAnd into sheath, too, thrust he his sword so good and long. \rFor his trusty chamberlain he did not wish to slay, \rAnd in such case he could not grant his anger fullest sway. \r\r497 \rWith but his hands so mighty at Alberich he ran. \rBy the beard then seized he the gray and aged man, \rAnd in such manner pulled it that he full loud did roar. \rThe youthful hero\'s conduct Alberich did trouble sore. \r\r498 \rLoud cried the valiant steward: "Have mercy now on me. \rAnd might I other\'s vassal than one good hero\'s be, \rTo whom to be good subject I an oath did take, \rUntil my death I\'d serve thee." Thus the man of cunning spake. \r\r499 \rAlberich then bound he as the giant before. \rThe mighty arm of Siegfried did trouble him full sore.^ \rThe Dwarf began to question: "Thy name, what may it be?" \rQuoth he : "My name is Siegfried ; I weened I well were known to \r\rthee." \r\r500 \r"I joy to hear such tidings," Dwarf Alberich replied. \r"Well now have l" found thee in knightly prowess tried, \rAnd with goodly reason lord o\'er lands to be. \rI\'ll do whate\'er thou biddest, wilt thou only give me free." \r\r5\xc2\xa1! \rThen spake his master Siegfried: "Quickly shalt thou go, \rAnd bring me knights hither, the best we have to show, \rA thousand Nibelungen, to stand before their lord." \rWherefore thus he wished it, spake he never yet a word. \r\r\r\r76 EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r502 \rThe giant and Alberich straightway he unbound. \rThen ran Alberich quickly where the knights he found. \rThe warriors of Nibelung he wakened full of fear. \rQuoth he: "Be up, ye heroes, before Siegfried shall ye appear." \r\rFrom their couches sprang they and ready were full soon, \rClothed well in armor a thousand warriors boon, \rAnd went where they found standing Siegfried their lord. \rThen was a mickle greeting courteously in act and word. \r\r5\xc2\xa14 \rCandles many were lighted, and sparkling wine he drank. \rThat they came so quickly, therefor he all did thank. \rQuoth he: "Now shall ye with me from hence across the flood." \rThereto he found full ready the heroes valiant and good. \r\r5\xc2\xa15 \rGood thirty hundred warriors soon had hither pressed, \r\rFrom whom were then a thousand taken of the best. \r\rFor them were brought their helmets and what they else did need. \r\rFor unto Brunhild\'s country would he straightway the warriors lead. \r\r506 \rHe spake: "Ye goodly nobles, that would I have you hear, \rIn full costly raiment shall ye at court appear, \rFor yonder must there see us full many a fair lady. \rTherefore shall your bodies dight in good apparel be." \r\rUpon a morning early went they on their way. \rWhat host of brave companions bore Siegfried company! \rGood steeds took they with them and garments rich to wear, \rAnd did in courtly fashion unto Brunhild\'s country fare. \r\r508 \rAs gazed from lofty parapet women fair to see, \rSpake the queen unto them: "Knows any who they be, \rWhom I see yonder sailing upon the sea afar? \rRich sails their ships do carry, whiter than snow they are." \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FARED TO HIS KNIGHTS 77 \r\r\r\r5\xc2\xa19 \rThen spake the king of Rhineland: "My good men they are, \rThat on my journey hither left I lying near. \rI\'ve sent to call them to me: now are they come, O Queen." \rWith full great amazing were the stately strangers seen. \r\rThere saw they Siegfried out on the ship\'s prow stand \r\rClad in costly raiment, and with him his good band. \r\rThen spake Queen Brunhild: "Good monarch, let me know, \r\rShall I go forth to greet them, or shall I greetings high forego?" \r\r5" \r\rHe spake: "Thou shalt to meet them before the palace go, \rSo that we see them gladly they may surely know." \rThen did the royal lady fulfil the king\'s behest. \rYet Siegfried in the greeting was not honored with the rest. \r\rLodgings were made ready and their armor ta\'en in hand. \r\rThen was such host of strangers come into that land, \r\rOn all sides they jostled from the great company. \r\rThen would the knights full valiant homeward fare to Burgundy. \r\rThen spake Queen Brunhild: "In favor would I hold \rWho might now apportion my silver and my gold \rTo my guests and the monarch\'s, for goodly store I have." \rThereto an answer Dankwart, Giselher\'s good warrior, gave: \r\r5i4 \r"Full noble royal Lady, give me the keys to hold. \rI trow I\'ll so divide it," spake the warrior bold, \r" If blame there be about it, that shall be mine alone." \rThat he was not a niggard beyond a doubt he soon had shown. \r\r5i5 \rWhen now Hagen\'s brother the treasure did command, \rSo many a lavish bounty dealt out the hero\'s hand, \rWhoso mark did covet, to him was given such store \rThat all who once were poor men might joyous live for evermore. \r\r\r\r78 EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r5i6 \rIn sooth good pounds a hundred gave he to each and all. \rA host in costly raiment were seen before the hall, \rWho in equal splendor ne\'er before were clad. \rWhen the queen did hear it, verily her heart was sad. \r\r5 J 7 \rThen spake the royal lady: "Good King, it little needs, \rThat now thy chamberlain of all my stately weeds \rLeave no whit remaining, and squander clean my gold. \rWould any yet prevent it, him would I aye in favor hold. \r\r5i8 \r"He deals with hand so lavish, in sooth doth ween the thane \rThat death I\'ve hither summoned; but longer I\'ll remain. \rEke trow I well to spend all my sire hath left to me." \rNe\'er found queen a chamberlain of such passing generosity. \r\rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "Lady, be thou told, \r\rThat the king of Rhineland raiment hath and gold \r\rSo plenteous to lavish that we may well forego \r\rTo carry with us homeward aught that Brunhild can bestow." \r\r520 \r"No; as high ye hold me," spake the queen again, \r"Let me now have filled coffers twice times ten \rOf gold and silken raiment, that may deal out my hand, \rWhen that we come over into royal Gunther\'s land." \r\r521 \rThen with precious jewels the coffers they filled for her. \rThe while her own chamberlain must be standing near: \rFor no whit would she trust it unto Giselher\'s man. \rWhereat Gunther and Hagen heartily to laugh began. \r\r522 \rThen spake the royal lady: "To whom leave I my lands? \rFirst must, they now be given in charge from out our hands." \rThen spake the noble monarch: "Whomsoe\'er it pleaseth thee, \rEid him now come hither, the same we\'ll let our Warden be." \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FARED TO HIS KNIGHTS 70 \r\r523 \rOne of her highest kindred near by the lady spied, \r\r\xc3\x91 He was her mother\'s brother \xc3\x91 to him thus spake the maid: \r\r"Now be to thee entrusted the castles and eke the land, \r\rUntil that here shall govern Gunther the king by his own hand." \r\r5 2 4 \rTrusty knights two thousand from her company \rChose she to journey with her unto Burgundy, \rBeyond those thousand warriors from Nibelungenland. \rThey made ready for the journey, and downward rode unto the \rstrand. \r\r525 \rSix and eighty ladies led they thence with her, \r\rThereto good hundred maidens that full beauteous were. \r\rThey tarried no whit longer, for they to part were fain. \r\rOf those they left behind them, O how they all to weep began! \r\r526 \rIn high befitting fashion quitted she her land: \rShe kissed of nearest kindred all who round did stand. \rAfter fair leave-taking they went upon the sea. \rBack to her father\'s country came never more that fair lady. \r\r527 \rThen heard you on the journey many a kind of play: \r\rEvery pleasant pastime in plenty had they. \r\rSoon had they for their journey a wind from proper art: \r\rSo with full great rejoicing did they from that land depart. \r\r528 \rYet would she on the journey not be the monarch\'s spouse: \rBut was their pleasant pastime reserved for his own house \rAt Worms within his castle at a high festival, \rWhither anon full joyous came they with their warriors all. \r\r\r\rSo NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\rbO \r\r\r\rNINTH ADVENTURE \r\xc2\xa5ffijow Siegfried was sent to TIElorms \r\r5 2 9 \rWhen that they had journeyed full nine days on their way, \rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "Now hear what I shall say. \rWe tarry with the tidings for Worms upon the Rhine. \rAt Burgundy already should now be messengers of thine." \r\r530 \rThen outspake King Gunther: "There hast thou spoken true. \rAnd this selfsame journey, none were so fit thereto \rAs thyself, friend Hagen. So do thou now ride on. \rThis our high court journey, none else can better make it known." \r\r53 1 \rThereto answered Hagen: "Poor messenger am I. \rLet me be treasure-warden. Upon the ships I\'ll stay \rNear by the women rather, their guardian to be, \rTill that we bring them safely into the land of Burgundy. \r\r53 2 \r"Now do thou pray Siegfried that he the message bear, \rFor he\'s a knight most fitting this thing to have in care. \rIf he decline the journey, then shalt thou courteously, \rFor kindness to thy sister, pray that he not unwilling be." \r\r533 \rHe sent for the good warrior who came at his command. \rHe spake: \'\'Since we are nearing home in my own land, \rSo should I send a message to sister dear of mine \rAnd eke unto my mother, that we are nigh unto the Rhine. \r\r534 \r"Thereto I pray thee, Siegfried, now meet my wish aright," \rSpake the noble monarch: "I\'ll ever thee requite." \rBut Siegfried still refused it, the full valiant man, \rTill that King Gunther sorely to beseech began. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED WAS SENT TO WORMS 81 \r\r535 \rHe spake: "Now bear the message, in favor unto me \r\rAnd eke unto Kriemhild a maiden fair to see, \r\rThat the stately maiden help me thy service pay." \r\rWhen had heard it Siegfried, ready was the knight straightway. \r\r536 \r"Now what thou wilt, command me: \'twill not be long delayed. \rThis thing will I do gladly for sake of that fair maid. \rWhy should I aught refuse her, who all my heart hath won? \rWhat thou for her commandest, whate\'er it be \'twill all be done." \r\r537 \r"Then say unto my mother, Ute the queen, \rThat we on our journey in joyous mood have been. \rLet know likewise my brothers what fortune us befell. \rEke unto all our kinsmen shalt thou then merry tidings tell. \r\r538 \r"Unto my fair sister shalt thou all confide. \rFrom me bring her fair compliment and from Brunhild beside, \rAnd eke unto our household and all my warriors brave. \rWhat my heart e\'er did strive for, how well accomplished it I have! \r\r539 \r"And say as well to Ortwein nephew dear of mine \rThat he do bid make ready at Worms beside the Rhine. \rAnd all my other kindred, to them made known shall be, \rWith Brunhild I am minded to keep a great festivity. \r\r54o \r"And say unto my sister, when that she hath learned \rThat I am to my country with many a guest returned, \rShe shall have care to welcome my bride in fitting way. \rSo all my thoughts of Kriemhild will be her service to repay." \r\r54i \rThen did Sir Siegfried straightway in parting greet \rHigh the Lady Brunhild, as \'twas very meet, \rAnd all her company; then toward the Rhine rode he. \rNor in this world a better messenger might ever be. \r\r\r\r82 NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r542 \rWith four and twenty warriors to Worms did he ride. \rWhen soon it was reported the king came not beside, \rThen did all the household of direst news have dread: \rThey feared their royal master were left in distant country dead. \r\r543 \rThen sprang they from the saddle, full high they were of mood. \r\rFull soon before them Giselher the prince so youthful stood, \r\rAnd Gemot his brother. How quickly then spake he, \r\rWhen he the royal Gunther saw not in Siegfried\'s company: \r\r544 \r"Be thou welcome, Siegfried. Yet shalt thou tell to me, \rWhy the king my brother cometh not with thee. \rBrunhild\'s prowess is it hath taken him, I ween; \rAnd so this lofty wooing hath naught but our misfortune been." \r\r545 \r"Now cease such ill foreboding. To you and friends hath sent \r\rMy royal companion his good compliment. \r\rSafe and sound I left him; myself did he command \r\rThat I should be his herald with tidings hither to your land. \r\r546 \r"Quickly shall ye see to it, how that it may be, \rThat I the queen and likewise your fair sister see. \rFrom Gunther and Brunhild the message will I tell \rThat hath now been sent them: the twain do find them passing \rwell. " \r\r547 \rThen spake the youthful Giselher: "So shalt thou go to her: \r\rHere dost thou on my sister a favor high confer. \r\rIn sooth she\'s mickle anxious how\'t with my brother be. \r\rThe maid doth see thee gladly, \xc3\x91 of that will I be surety." \r\r548 \rThen outspake Sir Siegfried: "If serve her aught I can, \rThat same thing most willing in truth it shall be done. \rWho now will tell the ladies I would with them confer?" \rThen was therein Giselher the stately knight his messenger. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED WAS SENT TO WORMS 83 \r\r549 \rGiselher the valiant unto his mother kind \r\rAnd sister spake the tidings when he the twain did find: \r\r"To us returned is Siegfried, the hero of Netherland; \r\rUnto the Rhine he cometh at my brother Gunther\'s command. \r\r55\xc2\xa1 \r"He bringeth us the tidings how\'t with the king doth fare. \r\rNow shall ye give permission that he \'fore you appear. \r\rHe\'ll tell the proper tidings from Isenland o\'er the main." \r\rYet mickle sad forebodings did trouble still the ladies twain. \r\rS5i \rThey sprang for their attire and donned it nothing slow. \r\rThen bade they that Siegfried to court should thither go. \r\rThat did he right willing for he gladly them did see. \r\rKriemhild the noble maiden spake to him thus graciously. \r\r552 \r"Welcome be, Sir Siegfried, thou knight right praiseworthy. \rYet where may King Gunther my noble brother be? \rIt is through Brunhild\'s prowess, I ween, he is forlorn. \rAlack of me, poor maiden, that I into this world was born!" \r\r553 \rThe valiant knight then answered: "Give me news-bringer\'s meed. \r\rKnow ye, fairest ladies, ye weep without a need. \r\rI left him well and happy, that would I have you know; \r\rThey two have sent me hither to bear the tidings unto you. \r\r554 \r"And offer thee good service both his bride and he, \rMy full noble lady, in love and loyalty. \rNow give over weeping, for straight will they be here." \rThey had for many a season heard not a tale to them so dear. \r\r555 \rWith fold of snow-white garment then her eyes so bright \r\rDried she after weeping. She gan thank the knight \r\rWho of these glad tidings had been the messenger. \r\rThen was a mickle sorrow and cause of weeping ta\'en from her. \r\r\r\r84 NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r556 \rShe bade the knight be seated, which he did willingly. \rThen spake the lovely maiden: "It were a joy to me, \rCould I the message-bringer with gold of mine repay. \rThereto art thou too high-born; I\'ll serve thee then in other way." \r\r557 \r"If I alone were ruler," spake he, "o\'er thirty lands, \rYet gifts I\'d take right gladly, came they from thy fair hands." \rThen spake the virtuous maiden: "In truth it shall be so." \rThen bade she her chamberlain forth for message-money go. \r\r558 \rFour and twenty armlets with stones of precious kind, \rThese gave she him for guerdon. \'Twas not the hero\'s mind, \rThat he himself should keep them: he dealt them all around \rUnto her fair attendants whom he within the chamber found. \r\r559 \rOf service, too, her mother did kindly offer make. \r"Then have I more to tell you," the keen warrior spake: \r"Of what the king doth beg you, when comes he to the Rhine. \rWilt thou perform it, lady, then will he e\'er to thee incline. \r\r560 \r"The noble guests he bringeth, \xc3\x91 this heard I him request, \rThat ye shall well receive them; and furthermore his hest, \rThat ye ride forth to meet him \'fore Worms upon the strand. \rSo have ye from the monarch faithfully his high command." \r\r56i \rThen spake the lovely maiden: "Full ready there am I. \rIf I in aught can serve him, I\'ll never that deny. \rIn all good faith and kindness shall it e\'er be done." \rThen deeper grew her color that from increase of joy she won. \r\r562 \rNever was royal message better received before. \rThe lady sheer had kissed him, if \'twere a thing to dare. \rFrom those high ladies took he his leave in courteous wise. \rThen did they there in Burgundy in way as Siegfried did advise. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED WAS SENT TO WORMS 85 \r\r563 \rSindold and Hunold and Rumold the thane \r\rIn truth were nothing idle, but wrought with might and main \r\rTo raise the sitting-places \'fore Worms upon the strand. \r\rThere did the royal Steward busy \'mid the workers stand. \r\r564 \rOrtwein and Gere thought longer not to bide, \rBut sent unto their kinsmen forth on every side. \rThey told of festive meeting there that was to be; \rAnd deck themselves to meet them did the maidens fair to see. \r\r565 \r\rThe walls throughout the palace were dight full richly all, \rLooking unto the strangers; and King Gunther\'s hall \rFull well with seats and tables for many a noble guest. \rAnd great was the rejoicing in prospect of the mighty feast. \r\r566 \rThen rode from every quarter hither through the land \rThe three monarchs\' kinsmen, who there were called to hand, \rThat they might be in waiting for those expected there. \rThen from enfolding covers took they store of raiments rare. \r\r567 \rSome watchers brought the tidings that Brunhild\'s followers were \rSeen coming riding hither. Then rose a mickle stir \rAmong the folk so many in the land of Burgundy. \rHeigh-ho! What valiant warriors alike on both parts might you see ! \r\r568 \rThen spake the fair Kriemhild: "Of my good maidens, ye \rWho at this reception shall bear me company, \rFrom out the chests now seek ye attire the very best. \rSo shall praise and honor be ours from many a noble guest." \r\r569 \rThen came the knights also and bade bring forth to view \r\rThe saddles richly furnished of ruddy golden hue, \r\rThat ladies fair should ride on at Worms unto the Rhine. \r\rBetter horse-equipment could never artisan design. \r\r\r\r86 NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r57\xc2\xa1 \rHeigh-ho!

Kriemhild there to greet \rThey went, all fair to look on, in shining garments clad. \rThen came eke well apparelled full many a fair and stately maid. \r\r573 \rFour and fifty were they of the land of Burgundy, \rAnd they were eke the noblest that ever you might see. \rAdorned with shining hair-bands the fair-haired maids came on. \rWhat now the king desired, that most carefully was done. \r\r574 \rMade of stuffs all costly, the best you might desire, \rBefore the gallant strangers wore they such rich attire \rAs well did fit the beauty of many amid the throng. \rHe sure had lost his senses, who could have wished them any wrong. \r\r575 \rOf sable and of ermine many a dress was worn. \rArms and hands a many did they full well adorn \rWith rings o\'er silken dresses that there did clothe them well. \rOf all the ready-making none might ever fully tell. \r\r576 \rFull many a well-wrought girdle in long and costly braid \rAbout the shining garments by many a hand was laid \rOn dress of precious ferrandine of silk from Araby. \rAnd full of high rejoicing were those maids of high degree. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED WAS SENT TO WORMS 87 \r\r577 \rWith clasps before her bosom was many a fair maid \rLaced full beauteously. She might well be sad, \rWhose full beaming color vied not with weeds she wore. \rSuch a stately company ne\'er possessed a queen before. \r\r578 \rWhen now the lovely maidens attired you might see, \rSoon were those beside them should bear them company, \rOf warriors high-hearted a full mickle band. \rAnd with their shields they carried full many an ashen shaft in hand. \r\r\r\rTENTH ADVENTURE \rDow JSrunbilo was receiveo at "CClorms \r\r579 \rOn yonder side Rhine river they saw a stately band, \r\rThe king and host of strangers, ride down unto the strand, \r\rAnd also many a lady sitting on charger led. \r\rBy those who should receive them was goodly preparation made. \r\r580 \rSoon they of Isenland the ship had entered then, \rAnd with them Siegfried\'s vassals the Nibelungen men; \rThey strained unto the shore with untiring hand \rWhen they beheld the monarch\'s friends upon the farther strand. \r\r58i \rNow list ye eke the story of the stately queen, \rUte, how at her bidding ladies fair were seen \rForth coming from the castle to ride her company. \rThen came to know each other full many a knight and fair lady. \r\r582 \rThe Margrave Gere but to the castle gate \rThe bridle held for Kriemheld; the keen Siegfried did wait \rThenceforward upon her. She was a beauteous maid. \rWell was the knight\'s good sendee by the lady since repaid. \r\r\r\r88 TENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r583 \rOrtwein the valiant Queen Ute rode beside, \rAnd many a knight full gallant was stately lady\'s guide. \rAt such a high reception, that may we say, I ween, \rWas ne\'er such host of ladies in company together seen. \r\r584 \rWith show of rider\'s talent the tilt was carried on, \rFor might the knights full gallant naught fitting leave undone, \rAs passed down to the river Kriemhild the lady bright. \rThen helped was many a lady fair from charger to alight. \r\r585 \rThe king had then come over and many a stranger too. \rHeigh-ho! What strong shafts splintered before the ladies flew! \rMany a shaft go crashing heard you there on shield. \rHeigh-ho! What din of costly arms resounded o\'er the field. \r\r586 \rThe full lovely maidens upon the shore did stand, \rAs Gunther with the strangers stepped upon the land; \rHe himself did Brunhild by the hand lead on. \rThen sparkled towards each other rich dress and many a shining \rstone. \r\r587 \rThen went Lady Kriemhild with fullest courtesy due, \rTo greet the Lady Brunhild and her retinue. \rAnd saw ye each the head-band with fair hand move aside \rWhen they kissed each other: high courtesy did the ladies guide \r\r588 \rThen spake the maiden Kriemhild, a high-born lady she: \r"Unto this our country shalt thou right welcome be, \rTo me and to my mother and each true friend of mine, \rThat we here have with us." Then each did unto each incline \r\r589 t u \r\rWithin their arms the ladies oft-times clasped each other. \r\rLike this fond reception heard ye of ne\'er another, \r\rAs when both the ladies there the bride did greet, \r\rQueen Ute and her daughter ; oft-times they kissed her lips so sweel \r\r\r\rHOW BRUNHILD WAS RECEIVED AT WORMS 89 \r\r\r\r59\xc2\xa1 \rWhen all of Brunhild\'s ladies were come upon the strand, \rThen was there taken full fondly by the hand \rBy the warriors stately many a fair lady. \rBefore the Lady Brunhild the train of fair maids might ye see. \r\r59i \rBefore their greetings ended a mickle time was gone, \rFor lips of rosy color were kissed there, many a one. \rLong stood they together, the royal ladies high, \rAnd so to look upon them pleased many a noble warrior\'s eye. \r\r59 2 \rThen spied with probing eye, too, who before did hear \rThat till then was never aught beheld so fair, \rAs those two royal ladies: they found it was no lie. \rIn all their person might ye no manner of deceit espy. \r\r593 \rWho there could spy fair ladies and judge of beauty rare, \rThey praised the wife of Gunther that she was passing fair; \rYet spake again the wise men who looked with keener gaze,^ \rThey rather would to Kriemhild before Brunhild award the praise. \r\r594 \rThen went unto each other maid and fair lady. \rFull many a fair one might ye in rich adornment see. \rThere stood rich tents a many, silken great and small, \rWherewith in every quarter \'fore Worms the field was covered all. \r\r595 \rOf the king\'s high kindred a mighty press there was. \rThen bade they Brunhild and Kriemhild on to pass, \rAnd with them all the ladies, where they in shade might be. \rThither did bring them warriors of the land of Burgundy. \r\r596 \rWhen now the strangers also on horse sat every one, \rPlenteous knightly tilting at shield was there begun. \rAbove the field rose dust-clouds, as had the country been \rAll in flames a-burning; who bore the honors there was seen. \r\r\r\rgo TENTH ADVENTURE \r\r597 \rLooked on full many a maiden as the knights did sport them so. \rMeseemeth that Sir Siegfried full many a to-and-fro \rDid ride with his good followers along \'fore many a tent. \rWith him of Nibelungen a thousand stately men there went. \r\r598 \rThen came of Tronje Hagen, whom the king did send; \r\rHe bade in pleasing manner the tourney have an end, \r\rBefore in dust be buried all the ladies fair. \r\rAnd ready to obey him soon the courteous strangers were. \r\r599 \rThen spake Sir Gemot: "Now let the chargers stand, \rUntil the air is cooler, for we must be at hand \rAs escort for fair ladies unto the stately hall; \rAnd will the king take saddle, so let him find you ready all." \r\r600 \rWhen now the sound of tourney o\'er all the field was spent, \rThen went for pleasant pastime \'neath many a lofty tent \rThe knights unto the ladies, and willing thither hied. \rAnd there they passed the hours till such time as they thence should \rride. \r\r601 \rJust before the evening when the sun was in the west, \rAnd the air grew cooler, no longer did they rest, \rBut both knights and ladies unto the castle passed. \rAnd eyes in loving glances on many a beauteous maid were cast. \r\r602 \rBy hand of goodly warrior many a coat was rent, \rFor in the country\'s custom they tourneyed as they went, \rUntil before the palace the monarch did dismount. \rThey tended fairest ladies as knights high-spirited are wont. \r\r603 \rAfter fairest greeting the queens did part again. \rDame Ute and her daughter, thither passed the twain \rWith train of fair attendants unto a hall full wide. \rDin of merrymaking heard ye there on every side. \r\r\r\rHOW BRUNHILD WAS RECEIVED AT WORMS 91 \r\r604 \rArranged were sitting-places where the king would be \rWith his guests at table. By him might ye see \rStanding the fair Brunhild. She wore a royal crown \rIn the monarch\'s country, , the which might well such mistress own. \r\r605 \rSeats for all the people at many a spacious board \rThere were, as saith the story, where victuals rich were stored. \rHow little there was lacking of all that makes a feast! \rAnd by the monarch saw ye sitting many a stately guest. \r\r606 \rThe royal host\'s attendants in basins golden red \rCarried water forward. And should it e\'er be said \rBy any that a better service did receive \rEver guests of monarch, I never could such thing believe. \r\r607 \rBefore the lord of Rhineland with water was waited on, \rUnto him Sir Siegfried, as fitting was, had gone; \rHe called to mind a promise that made by him had been \rEre that the Lady Brunhild afar in Isenland he\'d seen. \r\r608 \rHe spake : "Thou shalt bethink thee what once did plight thy hand, \rIf that the Lady Brunhild should come unto this land, \rThou\'dst give to me thy sister. Where now what thou hast sworn ? \rIn this thy wooing journey not small the labor I have borne." \r\r609 \rThen to his guest the monarch: "Well hast thou minded me, \rAnd by this hand shall never false word plighted be. \rTo gain thy wish I\'d help thee in the way as best I know." \rBidden then was Kriemhild forth unto the king to go. \r\r610 \rWith her full beauteous maidens unto the Hall she passed. \rThen sprang the youthful Giselher adown the steps in haste \r"Bid now these many maidens wend their way again; \rNone but my sister only unto the king shall enter in." \r\r\r\rg2 TENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r611 \r\rThen led they Kriemhild thither where the king was found, \rWith him were knights full noble from many a land around. \rWithin that Hall so spacious she waited the king\'s behest, \rWhat time the Lady Brunhild betook her likewise to the feast. \r\r612 \rThen spake the royal Gunther: " Sister mine full fair, \rRedeem the word I\'ve given, an hold\'st thou virtue dear. \rThee to a knight I plighted: An tak\'st thou him to man, \rThereby my wish full truly unto the warrior hast thou done." \r\r613 \rThen spake the noble maiden: " Brother full dear to me, \rNot long shalt thou entreat me. In truth I\'ll ever be \rObedient to thy bidding; that shall now be done, \rAnd him I\'ll take full gladly, my Lord, whom thou giv\'st me for \rman." \r\r614 \rBefore those fair eyes\' glances grew Siegfried\'s color red. \rThe knight to Lady Kriemhild his service offered. \rWithin a ring together then were led the twain, \rAnd they asked the maiden, if she to take the knight were fain. \r\rUpon her face not little was the modest glow; \rNathless to joy of Siegfried did fortune will it so, \rThat the maiden would not refuse the knight her hand. \rEke swore his wife to make her the noble king of Netherland. \r\r616 \rWhen he to her had plighted, and eke to him the maid, \rSiegfried to embrace her nothing more delayed, \rBut clasped in arms full fondly and oft the lady fair, \rAnd stately knights were witness how that he kissed the princess \rthere. \r\r617 \rWhen that the maids attendant from thence had ta\'en their leave ; \rIn place of honor seated Siegfried might ye perceive \rAnd by him fairest Kriemhild; and many a knight at hand \rWas seen of the Nibelungen at Siegfried\'s service ready stand. \r\r\r\rHOW BRUNHILD WAS RECEIVED AT WORMS 93 \r\r618 \rThere too was Gunther seated and with him Queen Brunhild. \rAt sight of Kriemhild sitting by Siegfried was she filled \rWith anger such as never before her heart did swell: \rShe wept, and tears in plenty adown her shining face there fell. \r\r619 \rThen spake who ruled the country: "What aileth, lady mine, \rThat so thou let\'st be dimmed thine eyes that brightly shine? \rBe straight of joyous spirit, for now at thy command \rMy land and my good castles and host of stately warriors stand." \r\r620 \r"Good cause to me for weeping," spake the lady fair. \r"For sake of this thy sister sorrow now I bear, \rWhom here behold I seated by one that serveth thee. \rThat must forever grieve me, shall she thus dishonored be." \r\r621 \rThen answered her King Gunther: "But for the nonce be still. \rAt other time more fitting the thing to thee I\'ll tell, \rWherefore thus my sister to Siegfried I did give. \rAnd truly with the hero may she ever joyous live." \r\r622 \rShe spake: "Her name and beauty thus lost it grieveth me. \rAn knew I only whither, from hence I\'d surely flee, \rThis night nor e\'er hereafter to share thy royal bed, \rSay\'st thou not truly wherefore Kriemhild thus hath Siegfried wed." \r\r623 \rThen spake the noble monarch: "Then unto thee be known \rThat he as stately castles, lands wide as I, doth own. \rAnd know thou that full surely a mighty monarch he; \rWherefore the fairest maiden I grant him thus his wife to be." \r\r624 \rWhate\'er the king did tell her, sad was she yet of mood. \rThen hastened from the tables full many a warrior good, \rAnd jousted that the castle walls gave back the din. \rAmid his guests the monarch waiting longingly was seen. \r\r\r\r94 TENTH ADVENTURE \r\r625 \rHe deemed \'twere better lying beside his fair lady. \rOf thinking on that plaisance his mind he could not free, \rAnd what her love would bring him before the night be past; \rHe many a glance full tender upon the Lady Brunhild cast. \r\r626 \rThe guests they bade give over in joust who combated, \rFor that with spouse new-wedded the monarch would to bed. \rLeaving then the banquet, there together met \rKriemhild and Brunhild: their bitter hate was silent yet. \r\r627 \rAt hand were their attendants; they longer tarried not, \rAnd chamberlains full lordly lights for them had brought. \rThen parted eke the followers of the monarchs twain, \rAnd bearing Siegfried company went full many a worthy thane. \r\r628 \rThe lords were both come thither where that they should lie. \rAs each one bethought him of loving victory \rTo win o\'er winsome lady, merry he grew of mood. \rThe noble Siegfried\'s pastime it was beyond all measure good. \r\r629 \rAs there Sir Siegfried by fair Kriemhild lay \rAnd to the maid devoted himself in such fond way \rAs noble knight beseemeth, they twain to him were one, \rAnd not a thousand others had he then ta\'en for her alone. \r\r630 \rI\'ll tell you now no further how he the lady plied, \rBut list ye first the story what Gunther did betide \rBy Lady Brunhild lying. In sooth the noble thane \rBy side of other ladies a deal more happily had lain. \r\r631 \rWithdrawn were now attendants, man and also maid; \rNot long to lock the chamber within the king delayed. \rHe weened to have good pleasure of that fair lady, \rYet was the time still distant when that she his wife should be. \r\r\r\rHOW BRUNHILD WAS RECEIVED AT WORMS 95 \r\r632 \rIn gown of whitest linen unto the bed she passed. \rThen thought the knight full noble: "Now have I here at last \rAll that I e\'er desired as long as I can tell." \rPerforce her stately beauty did please the monarch passing well. \r\rThat they should shine more dimly he placed the lights aside, \r\rThen where did lie the lady the thane full eager hied. \r\rHe placed himself a-nigh her, his joy right great it was, \r\rAs in his arms the monarch the winsome maid did there embrace. \r\r634 \rA loving plaisance had he with vigor there begun \rIf that the noble lady had let the same be done. \rShe then did rage so sorely that grieved was he thereat; \rHe weened to find who loved him, \xc3\x91 instead he found him naught \rbut hate. \r\r635 \rSpake she: "Good knight and noble, from this thing give o\'er. \r\rThat which thou here hast hope of, it may be nevermore. \r\rA maid I still will keep me \xc3\x91 well mayest thou know that \xc3\x91 \r\rUntil I learn that story." Gunther wrathy grew thereat. \r\r636 \r\rHer gown he wrought to ruin to win her maidenhead. \r\rWhereat did seize a girdle the full stately maid, \r\rA strong and silken girdle that round her sides she wore, \r\rAnd with the same the monarch she soon had brought to pains full \r\rsore. \r\r637 \rHis feet and his hands also, together bound she all, \r\rUnto a nail she bore him and hung him on the wall. \r\rHim who disturbed her sleeping in his love she sorely let, \r\rAnd from her mighty prowess he full nigh his death had met. \r\r638 \r\rThen gan he to entreat her, who master late had been. \r\r"From these my bonds now loose me, my full noble queen. \r\rNor trow I e\'er, fair lady, victor o\'er thee to be, \r\rAnd henceforth will I seldom seek to lie thus nigh to thee." \r\r\r\r9 6 TENTH ADVENTURE \r\r639 \rShe recked not how \'twere with him, as she full softly lay. \rThere hung he, will he nill he, the night through unto day, \rUntil the light of morning through the windows shone. \rCould he e\'er boast of prowess, small now the measure he did own. \r\r640 \r"Now tell me, lordly Gunther, wert thou thereat so sad, \rIf that in bonds should find thee" \xc3\x91spake the fairest maid- \r"Thy royal men-in-waiting, bound by lady\'s hand?" \rThen spake the knight full noble: "Thou should\'st in case most \r\revil stand. \r\r641 \r"Eke had I little honor therefrom," continued he. \r"For all thy royal honor let me then go to thee. \rSince that my fond embracements do anger thee so sore, \rWith these my hands I pledge thee to touch thy garment never- \r\r\r\rmore." \r\r\r\r642 \r\rThen she loosed him straightway and he once more stood free. \rTo the bed he went as erstwhile where rested his lady. \rBut far from her he laid him and well he now forebore \rTo stir the lady\'s anger by touching e\'en the gown she wore. \r\r643 \rAt length came their attendants who garments fresh did bring, \rWhereof was ready for them good store on that mormng. \rYet merry as his folk were, a visage sad did own \rThe lord of that proud country, for all he wore that day a crown. \r\r644 \rAs was the country\'s custom, a thing folk do of right, \rGunther and Brunhild presently were dight \rTo go unto the minster where the mass was sung. _ \rThither eke came Siegfried, and in their trains a mighty throng \r\r645 \rAs fitted royal honor for them was thither brought \rThe crown that each should carry and garments nchly wrought. \rThere were they consecrated; and when the same was done, \rSaw ye the four together happy stand and weanng crown. \r\r\r\rHOW BRUNHILD WAS RECEIVED AT WORMS 97 \r\r646 \rThere was knighted many a squire, \xc3\x91 six hundred or beyond \xc3\x91 \rIn honor of the crowning, that shall ye understand. \rArose full great rejoicing in the land of Burgundy \rAs hand of youthful warrior did shatter shaft right valiantly. \r\r647 \rThen sat in castle casement maidens fair to see, \rAnd many a shield beneath them gleamed full brilliantly. \rYet himself had sundered from all his men the king; \rThough joyous every other, sad-visaged stood he sorrowing. \r\r648 \rHe and the doughty Siegfried, how all unlike their mood! \rWell wist the thing did grieve him that noble knight and good. \rHe went unto the monarch and straight addressed him so: \r"This night how hast thou fared? In friendship give thou me to \rknow." \r\rG49 \rTo his guest the king gave answer: "Than shame and scathe I\'ve \r\rnaught. \rThe devil\'s dam I surely into my house have brought. \rWhen as I thought to have her she bound me like a thrall; \rUnto a nail she bore me and hung me high upon the wall. \r\r650 \r"There hung I sore in anguish the night through until day \rEre that she would unbind me, the while she softly lay! \rAnd hast thou friendly pity know then the grief I bear." \rThen spake the doughty Siegfried : \' \' Such grieves me verily to hear. \r\r"The which I\'ll show thee truly, wilt thou me not deny. \rI\'ll bring it that to-night she so near to thee shall He \rThat she to meet thy wishes shall tarry nevermore." \rThereat rejoice did Gunther to think perchance his trials o\'er. \r\r652 \rThen further spake Sir Siegfried: "With thee \'twill yet be right. \rI ween that all unequal we twain have fared this night. \rTo me thy sister Kriemhild dearer is than life; \rEke shall the Lady Brunhild be yet this coming night thy wife." \r\r\r\r9 8 TENTH ADVENTURE \r\r653 \r"I\'ll come unto thy chamber this night all secretly," \r\rSpake he, "and wrapped in mantle invisible I\'ll be, \r\rThat of this my cunning naught shall any know; \r\rAnd thy attendants shalt thou bid to their apartments go. \r\r654 \r"The lights I\'ll all extinguish held by each page in hand, \rBy the which same token shalt thou understand \rI present am to serve thee. I\'ll tame thy shrewish wife \rThat thou this night enjoy her, else forfeit be my caitiff life." \r\r655 \r"An thou wilt truly leave me" \xc3\x91 answered him the king \xc3\x91 \r\r\'My lady yet a maiden, I joy o\'er this same thing. \r\rSo do thou as thou wiliest; and takest thou her life, \r\rE\'en that I\'ll let pass o\'er me, \xc3\x91 to lose so terrible a wife." \r\r656 \r"Thereto," spake then Siegfried, "plight I word of mine, \rTo leave her yet a maiden. A sister fair of thine \rIs to me before all women I ever yet have seen." \rGunther believed right gladly what had by Siegfried plighted been. \r\r657 \rMeanwhile the merry pastime with joy and zest went on. \rBut all the din and bustle bade they soon be done, \rWhen band of fairest ladies would pass unto the hall \r\'Fore whom did royal chamberlains bid backward stand the people \rall. \r\r658 \rThe chargers soon and riders from castle court were sped. \rEach of the noble ladies by bishop high was led, \rWhen that before the monarchs they passed to banquet board, \rAnd in their train did follow to table many a stately lord. \r\r659 \rThere sat the king all hopeful and full of merriment; \r\rWhat him did promise Siegfried, thereon his mind was bent. \r\rTo him as long as thirty did seem that single day; \r\rTo plaisance with his lady, thither turned his thought alway. \r\r\r\rHOW BRUNHILD WAS RECEIVED AT WORMS 99 \r\r\r\r660 \rAnd scarce the time he bided while that the feast did last. \rNow unto her chamber the stately Brunhild passed, \rAnd for her couch did Kriemhild likewise the table leave. \rBefore those royal ladies what host ye saw of warriors brave! \r\r661 \rFull soon thereafter Siegfried sat right lovingly^ \rWith his fair wife beside him, and naught but joy had he. \rHis hand she clasped full fondly within her hand so white, \rUntil\xc3\x91 and how she knew not\xc3\x91 he did vanish from her sight. \r\r662 \rWhen she the knight did fondle, and straightway saw him not, \rUnto her maids attendant spake the queen distraught: \r"Meseemeth a mickle wonder where now the king hath gone. \rHis hands in such weird fashion who now from out mine own hath \r\rdrawn?" \r\r663 \rYet further not she questioned. Soon had he hither gone \rWhere with lights were standing attendants many a one. \rThe same he did extinguish in every page\'s hand; \rThat Siegfried then was present Gunther thereby did understand. \r\r664 \rWell wist he what he would there; so bade he thence be gone \rLadies and maids-in-waiting. And when that was done, \rHimself the mighty monarch fast did lock the door: \rTwo bolts all wrought securely he quickly shoved the same before. \r\r665 \rThe lights behind the curtains hid he presently. \rSoon a play was started (for thus it had to be), \rBetwixt the doughty Siegfried and the stately maid: \rThereat was royal Gunther joyous alike and sad. \r\r666 \rSiegfried there laid him by the maid full near. \rSpake she: "Let be, now, Gunther, an hast thou cause to fear \rThose troubles now repeated which befell thee yesternight." \rAnd soon the valiant Siegfried through the lady fell in sorry plight. \r\r\r\rioo TENTH ADVENTURE \r\r667 \rHis voice did he keep under and ne\'er a word spake he. \rIntently listened Gunther, and though he naught could see, \rYet knew he that in secret nothing \'twixt them passed. \rIn sooth nor knight nor lady upon the bed had mickle rest. \r\r668 \rHe did there as if Gunther the mighty king he were, \rAnd in his arms he pressed her, the maiden debonair. \rForth from the bed she hurled him where a bench there stood, \rAnd head of valiant warrior against a stool went ringing loud. \r\r669 \rUp sprang again undaunted the full doughty man, \rTo try for fortune better. When he anew began \rPerforce to curb her fury, fell he in trouble sore. \rI ween that ne\'er a lady did so defend herself before. \r\r670 \rWhen he would not give over, up the maid arose: \r"My gown so white thou never thus shalt discompose. \rAnd this thy villain\'s manner shall sore by thee be paid, \rThe same I\'ll teach thee truly," further spake the buxom maid. \r\r671 \rWithin her arms she clasped him, the full stately thane, \rAnd thought likewise to bind him, as the king yestreen, \rThat she the night in quiet upon her couch might lie. \rThat her dress he thus did rumple, avenged the lady grievously. \r\r672 \rWhat booted now his prowess and eke his mickle might? \rHer sovereignty of body she proved upon the knight; \rBy force of arm she bore him, \xc3\x91 \'twixt wall and mighty chest \r(For so it e\'en must happen) him she all ungently pressed. \r\r673 \r"Ah me!" \xc3\x91 so thought the hero \xc3\x91 "shall I now my life \r\rLose at hand of woman, then will every wife \r\rEvermore hereafter a shrewish temper show \r\rAgainst her lord\'s good wishes, who now such thing ne\'er thinks \r\rto do." \r\r\r\rHOW BRUNHILD WAS RECEIVED AT WORMS 101 \r\r\r\r674 \rAll heard the monarch meanwhile and trembled for the man. \rSore ashamed was Siegfried, and a-raging he began. \rWith might and main he struggled again to make him free, \rEre which to sorest trouble \'neath Lady Brunhild\'s hand fell he. \r\r675 \rLon- space to him it seemed ere Siegfried tamed her mood. \rShe "grasped his hand so tightly that \'neath the nails the blood \rOozed from the pressure, which made the hero wince. \rYet the stately maiden subdued he to obedience since. \r\r676 \rHer unrestrained temper that she so late displayed, \rAll overheard the monarch, though ne\'er a word he said. \r\'Gainst the bed did press her Siegfried that aloud she cried, \rUngentle was the treatment that he meted to the bride. \r\r677 \rThen grasped she for a girdle that round her sides she wore, \rAnd thought therewith to bind him; but her limbs and body o\'er \rStrained beneath the vigor that his strong arm displayed. \rSo was the struggle ended \xc3\x91 Gunther\'s wife was vanquished. \r\r678 \rShe spake: "O noble monarch, take not my life away. \rThe harm that I have done thee full well will I repay. \rNo more thy royal embraces by me shall be withstood, \rFor now I well have seen it, thou canst be lord o\'er woman\'s mood." \r\r679 \rFrom the couch rose Siegfried, lying he left the maid, \rAs if that he would from him lay his clothes aside. \rHe drew from off her finger a ring of golden sheen \rWithout that e\'er perceived his practice the full noble queen. \r\r680 \rThereto he took her girdle that was all richly wrought: \rIf from wanton spirit he did it, know I not. \rThe same he gave to Kriemhild: the which did sorrow bear. \rThen lay by one another Gunther and the maiden fair. \r\r\r\rio2 TENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r68 1 \rHearty were his embraces as such king became: \rPerforce must she relinquish her anger and her shame. \rIn sooth not little pallid within his arms she grew, \rAnd in that love-surrender how waned her mighty prowess too! \r\r682 \rThen was e\'en she not stronger than e\'er another bride; \rHe lay with fond embraces the beauteous dame beside. \rAnd had she struggled further, avail how could it aught? \rGunther, when thus he clasped her, such change upon her strength \rhad wrought. \r\r683 \rAnd with right inward pleasure she too beside him lay \rIn warmest love embracings until the dawn of day! \rMeantime now had Siegfried departure ta\'en from there, \rAnd was full well received by a lady debonair. \r\r684 \rHer questioning he avoided and all whereon she thought, \rAnd long time kept he secret what he for her had brought, \rUntil in his own country she wore a royal crown; \rYet what for her he destined, how sure at last it was her own. \r\r685 \rUpon the morn was Gunther by far of better mood \rThan he had been before it; joy thus did spread abroad \r\'Mid host of knights full noble that from his lands around \rTo his court had been invited, and there most willing service found. \r\r686 \rThe merry time there lasted until two weeks were spent, \rNor all the while did flag there the din of merriment \rAnd every kind of joyance that knight could e\'er devise; \rWith lavish hand expended the king thereto in fitting wise. \r\r687 \rThe noble monarch\'s kinsmen upon his high command \rBy gifts of gold and raiment told forth his generous hand, \rBy steed and thereto silver on minstrel oft bestowed. \rWho there did gift desire departed thence in merry mood. \r\r\r\rHOW BRUNHILD WAS RECEIVED AT WORMS 103 \r\r\r\r688 \rAll the store of raiment afar from Netherland, \rThe which had Siegfried\'s thousand warriors brought to hand \rUnto the Rhine there with them, complete \'twas dealt away, \rAnd eke the steeds well saddled: in sooth a lordly life led they. \r\r689 \rEre all the gifts so bounteous were dealt the guests among, \rThey who would straightway homeward did deem the waiting long. \rNe\'er had guests of monarch such goodly gifts before; \rAnd so as Gunther willed it the merry feast at last was o\'er. \r\r\r\rELEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\xc2\xa5fcow SiegfrteD came borne witb bis TKHtte \r\r690 \rWhen that now the strangers all from thence were gone, \rSpake unto his followers noble Siegmund\'s son: \r"We shall eke make ready home to my land to fare." \rUnto his spouse was welcome such news when she the same did hear. \r\r691 \rShe spake unto her husband: "When shall we hence depart? \rNot hastily on the journey I pray thee yet to start. \rWith me first my brothers their wide lands shall share." \rSiegfried yet it pleased not such words from Kriemhild to hear. \r\r692 \rThe princes went unto him and spake they there all three: \r" Now know thou well, Sir Siegfried, for thee shall ever be \rIn faithfulness our service ready while yet we live." \rThe royal thanes then thanked he who thus did proof of friendship \rgive. \r\r693 \r"With thee further share we," spake young Giselher, \r"The lands and eke the castles by us that owned are. \rIn wide lands whatsoever we rule o\'er warriors brave, \rOf the same with Kriemhild a goodly portion shalt thou have. \r\r\r\rio4 ELEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r694 \rThen spake unto the princes the son of Siegmund \rWhen he their lofty purpose did rightly understand: \r"God grant your goodly heritage at peace may ever be, \rAnd eke therein your people. The spouse in sooth so dear to me \r\r695 \r"May well forego the portion that ye to her would give. \rFor she a crown shall carry, if to such day I live, \rAnd queen more rich than any that lives she then must be. \rWhat else to her ye offer, therein I\'ll meet you faithfully." \r\r696 \rThen spake the Lady Kriemhild: "If wealth thou wilt not choose, \rYet gallant thanes of Burgundy shalt thou not light refuse. \rThey\'re such as monarch gladly would lead to his own land. \rOf these shall make division with me my loving brothers\' hand." \r\r697 \rThereto spake noble Gemot: "Now take to please thy mind. \rWho gladly will go with thee full many here thou\'lt find. \rOf thirty hundred warriors we give thee thousand men \rTo be thy royal escort." Kriemhild did summon then \r\r698 \rHagen of Tronje to her and Ortwein instantly: \rAnd would they and their kinsmen make her good company? \rTo hear the same did Hagen begin to rage full sore. \rQuoth he: "E\'en royal Gunther may thus bestow us nevermore. \r\r699 \r"Other men that serve thee, let them follow thee; \rThou know\'st the men of Tronje and what their pledges be: \rHere must we by the monarchs in service true abide; \rHereto as them we followed, so shall we henceforth keep their side." \r\r700 \rAnd so the thing was ended: to part they ready make. \rA high and noble escort did Kriemhild to her take, \rMaidens two and thirty and five hundred men also. \rIn Lady Kriemhild\'s company the Margrave Eckewart did go. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED CAME HOME WITH HIS WIFE 105 \r\r701 \rLeave took they all together, squire and also knight, \rMaidens and fair ladies, as was their wont aright. \rThere parted they with kisses and eke with clasp of hand: \rRight merrily they journeyed forth from royal Gunther\'s land. \r\r702 \rTheir friends did give them escort upon the way full far. \rNight-quarters at every station they bade for them prepare, \rWhere they might wish to tarry as on their way they went. \rThen straightway was a messenger unto royal Siegmund sent, \r\r7\xc2\xa13 \rTo him and Siegelind bearing thereof the joyful sign \r\rThat his son was coming from Worms upon the Rhine \r\rAnd with him Ute\'s daughter, Kriemhild the fair lady. \r\rAs this could other message nevermore so welcome be. \r\r704 \r"Well is me!" quoth Siegmund, "that I the day have known, \rWhen the fair Lady Kriemhild here shall wear a crown. \rThus higher shall my kingdom stand in majesty. \rMy son the noble Siegfried here himself the king shall be." \r\r70S \rThen dealt the Lady Siegelind velvet red in store, \r\rSilver and gold full heavy to them the news that bore: \r\rShe joyed to hear the story that there her ear did greet. \r\rThen decked themselves her ladies all in rich attire meet. \r\r706 \r\'Twas told, with Siegfried coming whom they did expect. \rThen bade they sitting-places straightway to erect, \rWhere he before his kinsmen a crown in state should wear. \rThen men of royal Siegmund forward rode to meet him there. \r\r707 \rWas e\'er more royal greeting, news have I not to hand, \rAs came the knights full noble into Siegmund\'s land. \rThere the royal Siegelind to Kriemhild forth did ride \rWith ladies fair a many, and followed gallant knights beside \r\r\r\r106 ELEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r708 \rOut a full day\'s journey to welcome each high guest. \rAnd little with the strangers did they ever rest \rUntil into a castle wide they came once more, \rThe same was called Xanten, where anon a crown they wore. \r\r709 \rWith smiling lips Dame Siegelind \xc3\x91 and Siegmund eke did this- \rTo show the love they bore her full oft did Kriemhild kiss, \rAnd eke the royal Siegfried: far was their sorrow gone. \rAnd all the merry company, good welcome had they every one. \r\r710 \rThe train of strangers bade they \'fore Siegmund\' s Hall to lead, \rAnd maidens fair a many down from gallant steed \rHelped they there dismounting. Full many a man was there \rTo do them willing service as was meet for ladies fair. \r\r711 \rHow great soe\'er the splendor erstwhile beside the Rhine, \rHere none the less was given raiment yet more fine, \rNor were they e\'er attired in all their days so well. \rFull many a wonder might I of their rich apparel tell. \r\r712 \rHow there in state resplendent they sat and had full store, \rAnd how each high attendant gold-broidered raiment wore, \rWith stones full rare and precious set with skill therein! \rThe while with care did serve them Siegelind the noble queen. \r\rThen spake the royal Siegmund before his people so: \r\r" To every friend of Siegfried give I now to know \r\rThat he before these warriors my royal crown shall wear." \r\rAnd did rejoice that message the thanes of Netherland to hear. \r\r714 \rHis crown to him he tendered and rule o\'er wide domain \rWhereof he all was master.

"An\'t pleaseth thee to go \rThither to the festival, we\'ll counsel what thou do. \rThou shalt with thousand warriors unto Rhine river ride. \rSo may\'st thou well with honor in the land of Burgundy abide." \r\r761 \rThen spake of Netherland Siegmund the king: \r"Will ye to the festival, why hide from me the thing! \rI\'ll journey with you thither, if it not displeasing be, \rAnd lead good thanes a hundred wherewith to swell your \rcompany." \r\r762 \r"And wilt thou with us journey, father full dear to me," \rSpake the valiant Siegfried, "full glad thereat I\'ll be. \rBefore twelve days are over from these my lands I fare." \rTo all who\'d join the journey steeds gave they and apparel rare. \r\r\r\rii4 TWELFTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r763 \rWhen now the lofty monarch was minded thus to ride \rBade he the noble messengers longer not to bide, \rAnd to his lady\'s kinsmen to the Rhine a message sent, \rHow that he would full gladly join to make them merriment. \r\r764 \rSiegfried and Kriemhild, this same tale we hear, \rTo the messengers gave so richly that the burden could not bear \rTheir horses with them homeward, such wealth in sooth he had \rThe horses heavy-laden drove they thence with hearts full glad. \r\r765 \rSiegfried and Siegmund their people richly clad. \r\rEckewart the Margrave, straightway he bade \r\rFor ladies choose rich clothing, the best that might be found, \r\rOr e\'er could be procured in all Siegfried\'s lands around. \r\r766 \rThe shields and the saddles gan they eke prepare, \rTo knights and fair ladies who with them should fare \rLacked nothing that they wished for, but of all they were possessed \rThen to his friends led Siegfried many a high and stately guest. \r\r767 \rThe messengers swift hasted homeward on their way, \rAnd soon again came Gere to the land of Burgundy. \rFull well was he received, and there dismounted all \rHis train from off their horses before the royal Gunther\'s Hall. \r\r768 \rOld knights and youthful squires crowded, as is their way, \rTo ask of them the tidings.

Full many a mighty pot, \r\rAnd spacious pans and kettles, how many might ye see! \r\rFor those to them were coming prepared they victuals plenteously. \r\rTHIRTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r1bow tbeg fareo to tbe ffeast \r\r778 \rLeave we now the ardor wherewith they did prepare, \rAnd tell how Lady Kriemhild and eke her maidens fair \rFrom land of Nibelungen did journey to the Rhine. \rNe\'er did horses carry such store of raiment rich and fine. \r\r779 \rCarrying-chests full many for the way they made ready. \rThen rode the thane Siegfried with his friends in company \rAnd eke the queen thither where joy they looked to find. \rWhere now was high rejoicing they soon in sorest grief repined. \r\r780 \rAt home behind them left they Lady Kriemhild\'s son \rThat she did bear to Siegfried \xc3\x91 \'twas meet that that be done. \rFrom this their festive journey rose mickle sorrow sore: \rHis father and his mother their child beheld they never more. \r\r781 \rThen eke with them thither Siegmund the king did ride. \rHad he e\'er had knowledge what should there betide \rAnon from that high journey, such had he never seen: \rNe\'er wrought upon dear kindred might so grievous wrong have \rbeen. \r\r782 \rMessengers sent they forward that the tidings told should be. \rThen forth did ride to meet them with gladsome company \rUte\'s friends full many and many a Gunther\'s man. \rWith zeal to make him ready unto his guests the king began. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY FARED TO THE FEAST 117 \r\r783 \rWhere he found Brunhild sitting, thither straight went he. \r\r"How received thee my sister, as thou cam\'st to this country? \r\rLike preparations shalt thou for Siegfried\'s wife now make." \r\r"Fain do I that; good reason have I to love her well," she spake. \r\r784 \rThen quoth the mighty monarch: "The morn shall see them here. \rWilt thou go forth to meet them, apace do thou prepare, \rThat not within the castle their coming we await. \rGuests more welcome never greeted I of high estate." \r\r785 \rHer maidens and her ladies straight did she command \r\rTo choose them rich apparel, the best within the land, \r\rIn which the stately company before the guests should go. \r\rThe same they did right gladly, that may ye full surely know. \r\r786 \rThen eke to offer service the men of Gunther hied, \rAnd all his doughty warriors saw ye by the monarch\'s side. \rThen rode the queen full stately the strangers forth to meet, \rAnd hearty was the welcome as she her loving guests did greet. \r\r787 \rWith what glad rejoicings the guests they did receive! \rThey deemed that Lady Kriemhild did unto Brunhild give \rNe\'er so warm a welcome to the land of Burgundy. \rBold knights that yet were strangers rejoiced each other there to see. \r\r788 \rNow come was also Siegfried with his valiant men. \rThe warriors saw ye riding thither and back again, \rWhere\'er the plain extended, with huge company. \rFrom the dust and crowding could none in all the rout be free. \r\r789 \rWhen the monarch of the country Siegfried did see \r\rAnd with him also Siegmund, spake he full lovingly: \r\r"Be ye to me full welcome and to all these friends of mine. \r\rOur hearts right glad they shall be o\'er this your journey to the \r\rRhine." \r\r\r\r"8 THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r790 \r"God give thee meed," spake Siegmund, a knight in honor grown. \r"Since that my son Siegfried thee for a friend hath known, \rMy heart hath e\'er advised me that thee I soon should see." \rThereto spake royal Gunther: "Joy hast thou brought full great \rto me." \r\r791 \rSiegfried was there received, as fitted his high state, \rWith full lofty honors, nor one did bear him hate. \rThere joined in way right courteous Gemot and Giselher: \rI ween so warm a welcome did they make for strangers ne\'er. \r\r792 \rThe spouse of each high monarch greeted the other there. \rEmptied was many a saddle, and many a lady fair \rBy hero\'s hand was lifted adown upon the sward. \rBy waiting on fair lady how many a knight sought high reward! \r\r793 \rSo went unto each other the ladies richly dight; \rThereat in high rejoicing was seen full many a knight, \rThat by both the greeting in such fair way was done. \rBy fair maidens standing saw ye warriors many a one. \r\r794 \rEach took the hand of other in all their company; \rIn courteous manner bending full many might ye see \rAnd loving kisses given by ladies debonair. \rRejoiced the men of Gunther and Siegfried to behold them there. \r\r795 \rThey bided there no longer but rode into the town. \rThe host bade to the strangers in fitting way be shown, \rThat they were seen full gladly in the land of Burgundy. \rHigh knights full many tilting before fair ladies might ye see. \r\r796 \rThen did of Tronje Hagen and eke Ortwein \rIn high feats of valor all other knights outshine. \rWhate\'er the twain commanded dared none to leave undone; \rBy them was many a service to their high guests in honor shown. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY FARED TO THE FEAST 119 \r\r797 \rShields heard ye many clashing before the castle gate \rWith din of lances breaking. Long in saddle sate \rThe host and guests there with him, ere that within they went. \rWith full merry pastime joyfully the hours they spent. \r\r798 \rUnto the Hall so spacious rode the merry company. \rMany a silken cover wrought full cunningly \rSaw ye beyond the saddles of the ladies debonair \rOn all sides down hanging. King Gunther\'s men did meet them \rthere. \r\r799 \rLed by the same the strangers to their apartments passed. \r\rMeanwhile oft her glances Brunhild was seen to cast \r\rUpon the Lady Kriemhild, for she was passing fair. \r\rIn lustre vied her color with the gold that she did wear. \r\r800 \rWithin the town a clamor at Worms on every hand \rArose amid their followers. King Gunther gave command \rTo Dankwart his Marshal to tend them all with care. \rThen bade he fitting quarters for the retinue prepare. \r\r801 \rWithout and in the castle the board for all was set: \rIn sooth were never strangers better tended yet. \rWhatever any wished for did they straightway provide: \rSo mighty was the monarch that naught to any was denied. \r\r802 \rTo them was kind attention and all good friendship shown. \rThe host then at the table with his guests sat him down. \rSiegfried they bade be seated where he did sit before. \rThen went with him to table full many a stately warrior more. \r\r803 \rGallant knights twelve hundred in the circle there, I ween, \rWith him sat at table. Brunhild the lofty queen \rDid deem that never vassal could more mighty be. \rSo well she yet was minded, she saw it not unwillingly. \r\r\r\ri2o THIRTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r804 \rThere upon an evening, as the king with guests did dine, \rFull many a rich attire was wet with ruddy wine, \rAs passed among the tables the butlers to and fro. \rAnd great was their endeavor full honor to the guests to show. \r\r805 \rAs long hath been the custom at high festivity \rFit lodging there was given to maid and high lady. \rFrom whence soe\'er they came there they had the host\'s good care; \rUnto each guest was meted of fitting honors fullest share. \r\r806 \rWhen now the night was ended and came forth the dawn, \rFrom chests they carried with them, full many a precious stone \rSparkled on costly raiment by hand of lady sought. \rStately robes full many forth to deck them then they brought. \r\r807 \rEre dawn was full appeared, before the Hall again \rCame knights and squires many, whereat arose the din \rE\'en before the matins that for the king were sung. \rWell pleased was the monarch at joust to see the warriors young. \r\r808 \rFull lustily and loudly many a horn did blare, \rOf flutes and eke of trumpets such din did rend the air \rThat loud came back the echo from Worms the city wide. \rThe warriors high-hearted to saddle sprung on every side. \r\r809 \rArose there in that country high a jousting keen \rOf many a doughty warrior whereof were many seen, \rWhom there their hearts more youthful did make of merry mood; \rOf these \'neath shield there saw ye many a stately knight and good.\' \r\r810 \rThere sat within the casements many a high lady \rAnd maidens many with them, the which were fair to see. \rDown looked they where did tourney many a valiant man. \rThe host with his good kinsmen himself a-riding soon began. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY FARED TO THE FEAST 121 \r\r811 \r\rThus they found them pastime, and fled the time full well; \rThen heard they from the minster the sound of many a bell. \rForth upon their horses the ladies thence did ride; \rMany a knight full valiant the lofty queens accompanied. \r\r812 \rThey then before the minster alighted on the grass. \rUnto her guests Queen Brunhild yet well-minded was. \rInto the spacious minster they passed, and each wore crown. \rTheir friendship yet was broken by direst jealousy anon. \r\r813 \rWhen the mass was ended went they thence again \rIn full stately manner. Thereafter were they seen \rJoyous at board together. The pleasure full did last, \rUntil days eleven amid the merry-making passed. \r\r\r\rFOURTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\xc2\xa5ffijow tbe (Queens JBerateD Bacb \xc2\xa9tbec \r\r814 \rBefore the time of vespers arose a mickle stir \rOn part of warriors many upon the courtyard there. \rIn knightly fashion made they the time go pleasantly; \rThither knights and ladies went their merry play to see. \r\r815 \rThere did sit together the queens, a stately pair, \rAnd of two knights bethought them, that noble warriors were. \rThen spake the fair Kriemhild: "Such spouse in sooth have I, \rThat all these mighty kingdoms might well beneath his sceptre lie." \r\r816 \rThen spake the Lady Brunhild: "How might such thing be? \rIf that there lived none other but himself and thee, \rSo might perchance his power rule these kingdoms o\'er; \rThe while that liveth Gunther, may such thing be nevermore." \r\r\r\r122 FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r817 \rThen again spake Kriemhild: " Behold how he doth stand \rIn right stately fashion before the knightly band, \rLike as the bright moon beameth before the star\'s of heaven. \rIn sooth to think upon it a joyous mood to me is given." \r\r818 \rThen spake the Lady Brunhild: " How stately thy spouse be, \rHowe\'er so fair and worthy, yet must thou grant to me \rGunther, thy noble brother, doth far beyond him go: \rIn sooth before all monarchs he standeth, shalt thou truly know." \r\r819 \rThen again spake Kriemhild: "So worthy is my spouse, \rThat I not have praised him here without a cause. \rIn ways to tell full many high honor doth he bear: \rBelieve well may\'st thou, Brunhild, he is the royal Gunther\'s peer." \r\r820 \r"Now guard thee, Lady Kriemhild, my word amiss to take, \rFor not without good reason here such thing I spake. \rBoth heard I say together, when them I first did see, \rWhen that erstwhile the monarch did work his royal will o\'er me, \r\r821 \rAnd when in knightly fashion my love for him he won, \rThen himself said Siegfried he were the monarch\'s man. \rFor liegeman thus I hold him, since he the same did say." \rThen spake fair Lady Kriemhild: " With me \'twere dealt in sorry \rway. \r\r822 \r"And these my noble brothers, how could they such thing see, \rThat I of their own liegeman e\'er the wife should be ? \rThus will I beg thee, Brunhild, as friend to friend doth owe, \rThat thou, as well befits thee, shalt further here such words forego." \r\r823 \r|\xc3\x88No whit will I give over," spake the monarch\'s spouse. \r"Wherefore should I so many a knight full valiant lose, \rWho to us in service is bounden with thy man ?" \rKriemhild the fair lady thereat sore to rage began. \r\r\r\rHOW THE QUEENS BERATED EACH OTHER 12 \r\r\r\ro \r\r\r\r824 \r"In sooth must thou forego it that he should e\'er to thee \rAught of service offer. More worthy e\'en is he \rThan is my brother Gunther, who is a royal lord. \rSo shalt thou please to spare me what I now from thee have heard. \r\r825 \r"And to me is ever wonder, since he thy liegeman is, \rAnd thou dost wield such power over us twain as this, \rThat he so long his tribute to thee hath failed to pay. \r\'Twere well thy haughty humor thou should\'st no longer here dis- \rplay." \r\r826 \r"Too lofty now thou soarest," the queen did make reply. \r"Now will I see full gladly if in such honor high \rThis folk doth hold thy person as mine own it doth." \rOf mood full sorely wrathful were the royal ladies both. \r\r827 \rThen spake the Lady Kriemhild: "That straightway shall be seen. \rSince that thou my husband dost thy liegeman ween, \rTo-day shall all the followers of both the monarchs know, \rIf I \'fore wife of monarch dare unto the minster go. \r\r828 \r"That I free-born and noble shalt thou this day behold, \rAnd that my royal husband, as now to thee I\'ve told, \r\'Fore thine doth stand in honor, by me shall well be shown. \rEre night shalt thou behold it, how wife of him thou call\'st thine own \r\r829 \rTo court shall lead good warriors in the land of Burgundy. \rAnd ne\'er a queen so lofty as I myself shall be \rWas seen by e\'er a mortal, or yet a crown did wear." \rThen mickle was the anger that rose betwixt the ladies there. \r\r830 \rThen again spake Brunhild: "Wilt thou not service own, \rSo must thou with thy women hold thyself alone \rApart from all my following, as we to minster go." \rThereto gave answer Kriemhild : "In truth the same I fain will do ." \r\r\r\r124 FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r831 \r\'Now dress ye fair, my maidens," Kriemhild gave command. \r"Nor shall shame befall me here within this land. \rAn have ye fair apparel, let now be seen by you. \rWhat she here hath boasted may Brunhild have full cause to rue." \r\r832 \rBut little need to urge them: soon were they richly clad \rIn garments wrought full deftly, lady and many a maid. \rThen went with her attendants the spouse of the monarch high ; \rAnd eke appeared fair Kriemhild, her body decked full gorgeously, \r\rWith three and forty maidens, whom to the Rhine led she, \rAll clad in shining garments wrought in Araby. \rSo came unto the minster the maidens fair and tall. \rBefore the hall did tarry for them the men of Siegfried all. \r\r834 \rThe people there did wonder how the thing might be, \rThat no more together the queens they thus did see, \rAnd that beside each other they went not as before. \rThereby came thanes a many anon to harm and trouble sore. \r\r835 \rHere before the minster the wife of Gunther stood. \rAnd good knights full many were there of merry mood \rWith the fair ladies that their eyes did see. \rThen came the Lady Kriemhild with a full stately company. \r\r836 \rWhate\'er of costly raiment decked lofty maids before, \r\'Twas like a windy nothing \'gainst what her ladies wore. \rThe wives of thirty monarchs \xc3\x91such riches were her own \xc3\x91 \rMight ne\'er display together what there by Lady Kriemhild shown. \r\r837 - \rShould any wish to do so he could not say, I ween, \rThat so rich apparel e\'er before was seen \rAs there by her maidens debonair was worn: \rBut that it grieved Brunhild had Kriemhild that to do forborne. \r\r\r\rHOW THE QUEENS BERATED EACH OTHER 125 \r\r838 \rThere they met together before the minster high. \rSoon the royal matron, through mickle jealousy, \rKriemhild to pass no further, did bid in rage ull sore: \r"She that doth owe her homage shall ne\'er go monarch\'s wife \rbefore." \r\r839 \r\rThen spake the Lady Kriemhild \xc3\x91 angry was her mood: \r" An could\' st thou but be silent that for thee were good. \rThyself hast brought dishonor upon thy fair body: \rHow might, forsooth, a harlot ever wife of monarch be?" \r\r840 \r"Whom mak\'st thou now a harlot?" the king\'s wife answered her. \r"That do I thee," spake Kriemhild, "for that thy body fair \rFirst was clasped by Siegfried, knight full dear to me. \rIn sooth \'twas ne\'er my brother won first thy maidenhead from \rthee. \r\r841 \r\r"How did thy senses leave thee? Cunning rare was this. \rHow let his love deceive thee, since he thy liegeman is? \rAnd all in vain," quoth Kriemhild, " the plaint I hear thee bring." \r"In sooth," then answered Brunhild, "I\'ll tell it to my spouse the \rking." \r\r842 \r\r"What reck I of such evil? Thy pride hath thee betrayed, \rThat thou deem\'st my homage should e\'er to thee be paid. \rKnow thou in truth full certain the thing may never be: \rNor shall I e\'er be ready to look for faithful friend in thee." \r\r843 \rThereat did weep Queen Brunhild: Kriemhild waited no more, \rBut passed into the minster the monarch\'s wife before, \rWith train of fair attendants. Arose there mickle hate, \r\rWhereby eyes brightly shining anon did grow all dim and wet. \r\r\r\r126 FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r844 \rHowever God they worshipped or there the mass was sung, \rDid deem the Lady Brunhild the waiting all too long, \rFor that her heart was saddened and angry eke her mood. \rTherefore anon must suffer many a hero keen and good. \r\r845 \rBrunhild with her ladies \'fore the minster did appear. \rThought she: "Now must Kriemhild further give me to hear \rOf what so loud upbraideth me this free-tongued wife. \rAnd if he thus hath boasted, amend shall Siegfried make with life." \r\r846 \rNow came the noble Kriemhild followed by warrior band. \rThen spake the Lady Brunhild: "Still thou here shalt stand. \rThou giv\'st me out for harlot: let now the same be seen. \rKnow thou, what thus thou sayest to me hath mickle sorrow been." \r\r847 \rThen spake the Lady Kriemhild: "So may\'st thou let me go. \rWith the ring upon my finger I the same can show: \rThat brought to me my lover when first by thee he lay." \rNe\'er did Lady Brunhild know grief as on this evil day. \r\r848 \rQuoth she: " This ring full precious some hand from me did steak \rAnd from me thus a season in evil way conceal: \rFull sure will I discover who this same thief hath been." \rThen were the royal ladies both in mood full angry seen. \r\r849 \rThen gave answer Kriemhild: " I deem the thief not I. \rWell hadst thou been silent, hold\'st thou thine honor high. \rI\'ll show it with this girdle that I around me wear, \rThat in this thing I err not: Siegfried hath lain by thee full near." \r\r850 \rWrought of silk of Nineveh a girdle there she wore, \rThat of stones full precious showed a goodly store. \rWhen saw it Lady Brunhild straight to weep gan she: \rSoon must Gunther know it and all the men of Burgundy. \r\r\r\rHOW THE QUEENS BERATED EACH OTHER 127 \r\r851 m \rThen spake the royal matron: "Bid hither come to me \rOf Rhine the lofty monarch. Hear straightway shall he \rHow that his sister doth my honor stain. \rHere doth she boast full open that I in Siegfried\'s arms have lain." \r\r852 \rThe king came with his warriors, where he did weeping find \rHis royal spouse Brunhild, then spake in manner kind: \r"Now tell me, my dear lady, who hath done aught to thee?" \rShe spake unto the monarch: "Thy wife unhappy must thou see. \r\r853 \r"Me, thy royal consort, would thy sister fain \r\rRob of all mine honor. To thee must I complain: \r\rShe boasts her husband Siegfried hath known thy royal bed." \r\rThen spake the monarch Gunther: "An evil thing she then hath \r\rsaid." \r\r854 \r"I did lose a girdle: here by her \'tis worn, \rAnd my ring all golden. That I e\'er was born, \rDo I rue full sorely if thou wardest not from me \rThis full great dishonor: that will I full repay to thee." \r\r855 \rThen spake the monarch Gunther: "Now shall he come near, \r\rAnd hath he such thing boasted, so shall he let us hear: \rEke must full deny it the knight of Netherland." \rThen straight the spouse of Kriemhild hither to bring he gave com- \rmand. \r\r856 \rWhen that angry-minded Siegfried them did see, \rNor knew thereof the reason, straightway then spake he: \r"Why do weep these ladies? I\'d gladly know that thing, \rOr wherefore to this presence I am bidden by the king." \r\r857 \rThen spake the royal Gunther: "Sore grieveth me this thing: \r\rTo me my Lady Brunhild doth the story bring, \r\rHow that thereof thou boastest that her fair body lay \r\rFirst in thy embraces: this doth thy Lady Kriemhild say." \r\r\r\ri28 FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r858 \rThereto gave answer Siegfried: "An if she thus hath. said, \rFull well shall she repent it ere doth rest my head: \rBefore all thy good warriors of that I\'ll make me free, \rAnd swear by my high honor such thing hath ne\'er been told by me." \r\r859 \rThen spake of Rhine the monarch: "That shalt thou let us see. \rThe oath that thou dost offer, if such performed be, \rOf all false accusation shalt thou delivered stand." \rIn ring to take their station did he the high-born thanes command. \r\r860 \rThe full valiant Siegfried in oath the hand did give. \rThen spake the lordly monarch: "Well now do I perceive \rHow thou art all blameless, of all I speak thee free; \rWhat here maintains my sister, the same hath ne\'er been done by \rthee." \r\r861 \rThereto gave answer Siegfried: "If gain should e\'er accrue \rUnto my spouse, that Brunhild from her had cause to rue, \rKnow that to me full sorely \'twould endless sorrow be." \rThen looked upon each other the monarchs twain right graciously. \r\r862 \r"So should we govern women," spake the thane Siegfried, \r" That to leave wanton babble they should take good heed. \rForbid it to thy wife now, to mine I\'ll do the same. \rSuch ill-becoming manner in sooth doth fill my heart with shame." \r\r863 \rNo more said many a lady fair, but thus did part. \rThen did the Lady Brunhild grieve so sore at heart, \rThat it must move to pity all King Gunther\'s men. \rTo go unto his mistress Hagen of Tronje saw ye then. \r\r864 \rHe asked to know her worry, as he her weeping saw. \rThen told she him the story. To her straight made he vow, \rThat Lady Kriemhild\'s husband must for the thing atone, \rElse henceforth should never a joyous day by him be known. \r\r\r\rHOW THE QUEENS BERATED EACH OTHER 129 \r\rX/865 \rThen came Ortwein and Gemot where they together spake, \rAnd there the knights did counsel Siegfried\'s life to take. \rThither came eke Giselherf son of Ute high. \rWhen heard he what they counselled, spake he free from treachery: \r\r866 \r"Ye good knights and noble, wherefore do ye that? \rNe\'er deserved hath Siegfried in such way your hate, \rThat he therefor should forfeit at your hands his life. \rIn sooth small matter is it that maketh cause for woman\'s strife." \r\r867 \r"Shall we rear race of bastards? " Hagen spake again: \r"Therefrom but little honor had many a noble thane. \rThe thing that he hath boasted upon my mistress high, \rTherefor my life I forfeit, or he for that same thing shall die." \r\r868 \rThen spake himself the monarch: "To us he ne\'er did give \rAught but good and honor: let him therefore live. \rWhat boots it if my anger I vent the knight upon? \rGood faith he e\'er hath shown us, and that full willingly hath \rdone." \r\r869 \rThen outspake of Metz Ortwein the thane: \r"In sooth his arm full doughty may bring him little gain. \rMy vengeance full he\'ll suffer, if but my lord allow." \rThe knights \xc3\x91 nor reason had they \xc3\x91 against him mortal hate did \rvow. \r\r870 \rNone yet his words did follow, but to the monarch\'s ear \rNe\'er a day failed Hagen the thought to whisper there: \rIf that lived not Siegfried, to him would subject be \rRoyal lands full many. The king did sorrow bitterly. \r\r871 \rThen did they nothing further: soon began the play. \rAs from the lofty minster passed they on their way, \rWhat doughty shafts they shattered Siegfried\'s spouse before! \rGunther\'s men full many saw ye there in rage full sore. \r\r\r\ri 3 o FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r872 \rSpake the king: "Now leave ye such mortal enmity: \rThe knight is born our honor and fortune good to be. \rKeen is he unto wonder, hath eke so doughty arm \rThat, were the contest open, none is who dared to work him harm." \r\r873 \r"Naught shall he know," quoth Hagen. "At peace ye well may \r\rbe: \rI trow the thing to manage so full secretly \rThat Queen Brunhild\'s weeping he shall rue full sore. \rIn sooth shall he from Hagen have naught but hate for evermore." \r\r874 \rThen spake the monarch Gunther: "How might such thing e\'er \r\rbe?" \rThereto gave answer Hagen: "That shalt thou hear from me. \rWe\'ll bid that hither heralds unto our land shall fare, \rHere unknown to any, who shall hostile tidings bear. \r\r875 \r" Then say thou \'fore the strangers that thou with all thy men \r\rWilt forth to meet the enemy. He\'ll offer service then \r\rIf that thus thou sayest, and lose thereby his life, \r\rCan I but learn the story from the valiant warrior\'s wife." \r\r876 \rThe king in evil manner did follow Hagen\'s rede, \rAnd the two knights, ere any man thereof had heed, \rHad treachery together to devise begun. \rFrom quarrel of two women died heroes soon full many a one. \r\rFIFTEENTH ADVENTURE \r1bow Siegfried was aSetrageD \r\r877 \rUpon the fourth morning two and thirty men \r\rSaw ye to court a-riding. Unto King Gunther then \r\rWere tidings borne that ready he should make for foe \xc3\x91 \r\rThis lie did bring to women many, anon full grievous woe. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED WAS BETRAYED 131 \r\r878 \rLeave had they \'fore the monarch\'s presence to appear, \rThere to give themselves out for men of Luedeger, \rHim erstwhile was conquered by Siegfried\'s doughty hand \rAnd brought a royal hostage bound unto King Gunther\'s land. \r\r879 \rThe messengers he greeted and to seat them gave command. \rThen spake one amongst them: "Allow that yet we stand \rUntil we tell the tidings that to thee are sent. \rKnow thou that warriors many on thee to wreak their hate are bent. \r\r880 \r" Defiance bids thee Luedegast and eke Luedeger \rWho at thy hands full sorely erstwhile aggrieved were: \rIn this thy land with hostile host they\'ll soon appear." \rTo rage began the monarch when such tidings he did hear. \r\r881 \rThose who did act thus falsely they bade to lodge the while. \rHow himself might Siegfried guard against such guile \rAs there they planned against him, he or ever one? \rUnto themselves \'twas sorrow great anon that e\'er \'twas done. \r\r882 \rWith his friends the monarch secret counsel sought. \rHagen of Tronje let him tarry not. \r\rOf the king\'s men yet were many who fain would peace restore: \rBut nowise would Hagen his dark purpose e\'er give o\'er. \r\r883 \rUpon a day came Siegfried when they did counsel take, \rAnd there the knight of Netherland thus unto them spake: \r"How goeth now so sorrowful amid his men the king? \rI\'ll help you to avenge it, hath he been wronged in anything." \r\r884 \rThen spake the monarch Gunther: "Of right do I lament, \rLuedegast and Luedeger have hostile message sent: \rThey will in open manner now invade my land." \rThe knight full keen gave answer: "That in sooth shall Siegfried\'s \rhand, \r\r\r\r132 FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r885 \r"As doth befit thy honor, know well to turn aside. \rAs erstwhile to thy enemies, shall now from me betide: \rTheir lands and eke their castles laid waste by me shall be \rEre that I give over: thereof my head be surety. \r\r886 \r"Thou and thy good warriors shall here at home abide, \rAnd let me with my company alone against them ride. \rThat I do serve thee gladly, that will I let them see; \rBy me shall thy enemies, \xc3\x91 that know thou \xc3\x91 full requited be." \r\r887 \r"Good tidings, that thou sayest," then the monarch said, \rAs if he in earnest did joy to have such aid. \rDeep did bow before him the king in treachery. \rThen spake Sir Siegfried: "Bring that but little care to thee." \r\r888 \rThen serving-men full many bade they ready be: \r\'Twas done alone that Siegfried and his men the same might see. \rThen bade he make them ready the knights of Netherland, \rAnd soon did Siegfried\'s warriors for fight apparelled ready stand. \r\r889 \r"My royal father Siegmund, here shalt thou remain," \rSpake then Sir Siegfried. "We come full soon again \rIf God but give good fortune, hither the Rhine beside; \rHere shalt thou with King Gunther full merrily the while abide." \r\r890 \rThen bound they on the banners as they thence would fare. \rMen of royal Gunther were full many there, \rWho naught knew of the matter, or how that thing might be: \rThere with Siegfried saw ye of knights a mickle company. \r\r891 \rTheir helms and eke their mail-coats bound on horse did stand: \rAnd doughty knights made ready to fare from out that land. \rThen went of Tronje Hagen where he Kriemhild found \rAnd prayed a fair leave-taking, for that to battle they were bound. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED WAS BETRAYED 133 \r\r892 \r"Now well is me, such husband I have," Kriemhild said, \r"That to my loving kindred can bring so potent aid, t**"" \rAs my lord Siegfried doth now to friends of me. \rThereby," spake the high lady, "may I full joyous-minded be. \r\r893 \r" Now full dear friend Hagen, call thou this to mind, \r\rGood-will I e\'er have borne thee, nor hate in any kind. \r\rLet now therefrom have profit the husband dear to me. \r\rIf Brunhild aught I\'ve injured may\'t not to him requited be. \r\r894 j \r\r"For that I since have suffered," spake the high lady, v*" - " \r"Sore punishment hath offered therefor the knight to me. \rThat I have aught e\'er spoken to make her sad of mood, \rVengeance well hath taken on me the valiant knight and good." \r\r895 \r"In the days hereafter shall ye be reconciled full well. \r\rKriemhild, beloved lady, to me shalt thou tell \r\rHow that in Siegfried\'s person I may service do to thee. \r\rThat do I gladly, lady, and unto none more willingly." \r\r896 \r"No longer were I fearful," spake his noble wife, \r"That e\'er in battle any should take from him his life, \rWould he but cease to follow his high undaunted mood: \rSecure were then forever the thane full valiant and good." \r\r897 \r"Lady," spake then Hagen, "an hast thou e\'er a fear \rThat hostile blade should pierce him, now shalt thou give to hear \rWith what arts of cunning I may the same prevent. \rOn horse and foot to guard him shall ever be my fair intent." \r\r898 \rShe spake: "Of my kin art thou, as I eke of thine. \rIn truth to thee commended be then dear spouse of mine, \rThat him well thou guardest whom full dear I hold." \rShe told to him a story \'twere better had c he left untold. \r\r\r\ri34 FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r899 \rShe spake: "A valorous husband is mine, and doughty too. \rWhen he the worm-like dragon by the mountain slew, \rIn its blood the stately knight himself then bathed, \rSince when from cutting weapons in battle is he all unscathed. \r\r900 \r"Nathless my heart is troubled when he in fight doth stand, \rAnd full many a spear-shaft is hurled by hero\'s hand, \rLest that I a husband full dear should see no more. \rAlack! How oft for Siegfried must I sit in sorrow sore! \r\r901 \r"On thy good-will I rest me, dear friend, to tell to thee, \rAnd that thy faith thou fully provest now to me, \rWhere that my spouse may smitten be by hand of foe. \rThis I now shall tell thee, and on thy honor this I do. \r\r902 \r"When from the wounded dragon reeking flowed the blood, \rAnd therein did bathe him the valiant knight and good, \rFell down between his shoulders full broad a linden leaf. \rThere may he be smitten; \'tis cause to me of mickle grief.\' \r\r903 \rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "Upon his tunic sew \r\rThou a little token. Thereby shall I know \r\rWhere I may protect him when in the fight we strain." \r\rShe weened to save the hero, yet wrought she nothing save his bane. \r\r904 \rShe spake: "All fine and silken upon his coat I\'ll sew \rA little cross full secret. There, doughty thane, shalt thou \rFrom my knight ward danger when battle rageth sore, \rAnd when amid the turmoil he stands his enemies before." \r\r9o5 \r\'That will I do," quoth Hagen, "lady full dear to me." \r\rThen weened eke the lady it should his vantage be, \r\rBut there alone did Kriemhild her own good knight betray. \r\rLeave of her took Hagen, and joyously he went away. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED WAS BETRAYED 135 \r\r906 \rThe followers of the monarch were all of merry mood. \rI ween that knight thereafter never any could \rOf treachery be guilty such as then was he \rWhen that Queen Kriemhild did rest on his fidelity \r\r\r\r\r\r\r907 \rWith his men a thousand upon the following day \rRode thence Sir Siegfried full joyously away. \rHe weened he should take vengeance for harm his friends did bear. \rThat he might view the tunic Hagen rode to him full near. \r\r908 \rWhen he had viewed the token sent Hagen thence away \rTwo of his men in secret who did other tidings say: \rHow that King Gunther\'s country had nothing now to fear \rAnd that unto the monarch had sent them royal Luedeger. \r\r909 \r\'Twas little joy to Siegfried that he must turn again \rEre for the hostile menace vengeance he had ta\'en. \rIn sooth the men of Gunther could scarce his purpose bend. \rThen rode he to the monarch, who thus began his thanks to lend: \r\r910 \r"Now God reward thee for it, my good friend Siegfried, \rThat thou with mind so willing hast holpen me in need. *- \rThat shall I e\'er repay thee, as I may do of right. \rTo thee before all other friends do I my service plight. \r\r911 \r"Now that from battle-journey free we are once more, \rSo will I ride a-hunting the wild bear and the boar \rAway to the Vosges forest, as I full oft have done." \rThe same had counselled Hagen, the full dark and faithless man. **"\' \r\r912 \r"To all my guests here with me shall now be told \rThat we ride forth at daybreak: themselves shall ready hold, \rWho will join the hunting; will any here remain \rFor pastime with fair ladies, the thing behold I eke full fain." \r\r\r\r136 SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r913 \r\rThen outspake Sir Siegfried ds in manner due: \r\r"If that thou rid\'st a-hunting, go I gladly too. \r\rA huntsman shalt thou grant me and good hound beside \r\rThat shall the game discover; so with thee to the green I\'ll ride." \r\r914 \rStraightway spake the monarch: "Wilt thou but one alone? \rAnd wilt thou, four I\'ll grant thee, to whom full well is known \rThe forest with the runways where most the game doth stray, \rAnd who unto the camp-fires will help thee back to find thy way." \r\r9i5 \rUnto his spouse then rode he, the gallant knight and bold. \rFull soon thereafter Hagen unto the king had told \rHow he within his power would have the noble thane: \rMay deed so dark and faithless ne\'er by knight be done again! I*""" \r\r\r\rSIXTEENTH ADVENTURE \r?fcow Siegfried was slain \r\r916 \rGunther and Hagen, the knights full keen, \rProposed with evil forethought a hunting in the green: \rThe boar within the forest they\'d chase with pointed spear, \rAnd shaggy bear and bison. \xc3\x91 What sport to valiant men more \rdear? \r\r917 \rWith them rode also Siegfried happy and light of heart: \rTheir load of rich refreshments was made in goodly part. \rWhere a spring ran cooling they took from him his life, \rWhereto in chief had urged them Brunhild, royal Gunther\'s wife. \r\r918 \rThen went the valiant Siegfried where he Kriemhild found; \rRich hunting-dress was laden and now stood ready bound \rFor him and his companions across the Rhine to go. \rThan this a sadder hour nevermore could Kriemhild know. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED WAS SLAIN 137 \r\r919 \rThe spouse he loved so dearly upon the mouth he kissed. \r"God grant that well I find thee again, if so He list, \rAnd thine own eyes to see me. \'Mid kin that hold thee dear \rMay now the time go gently, the while I am no longer near." \r\r920 \rThen thought she of the story \xc3\x91 but silence must she keep \xc3\x91 \rWhereof once Hagen asked her: then began to weep \rThe princess high and noble that ever she was born, \rAnd wept with tears unceasing the valiant Siegfried\'s wife forlorn. \r\r921 \rShe spake unto her husband: "Let now this hunting be. \rI dreamt this night of evil, how wild boars hunted thee, \rTwo wild boars o\'er the meadow, wherefrom the flowers grew red. \rThat I do weep so sorely have I poor woman direst need. \r\r922 \r"Yea, do I fear, Sir Siegfried, something treacherous, \rIf perchance have any of those been wronged by us \rWho might yet be able to vent their enmity. \rTarry thou here, Sir Siegfried: let that my faithful counsel be." \r\r9 2 3 \rQuoth he: " I come, dear lady, when some short days are flown. \r\rOf foes who bear us hatred here know I never one. \xc2\xa3*\xc2\xa5*???" \r\rAll of thine own kindred are gracious unto me, \r\rNor know I aught of reason why they should other-minded be." \r\r924 \r"But nay, beloved Siegfried, thy death I fear \'twill prove. \rThis night I dreamt misfortune, how o\'er thee from above \rDown there fell two mountains: I never saw thee more. \rAnd wilt thou now go from me, that must grieve my heart full sore." \r\r925 \rThe lady rich in virtue within his arms he pressed, \r\rAnd with loving kisses her fair form caressed. \r\rFrom her thence he parted ere long time was o\'er: \r\rAlas for her, she saw him alive thereafter nevermore. \r\r\r\r138 SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r926 \rThen rode from thence the hunters deep within a wold \rIn search of pleasant pastime. Full many a rider bold \rFollowed after Gunther in his stately train. \rGemot and Giselher, \xc3\x91 at home the knights did both remain. \r\r927 \rWent many a horse well laden before them o\'er the Rhine, \rThat for the huntsmen carried store of bread and wine, \rMeat along with fishes and other victualling, \rThe which upon his table were fitting for so high a king. \r\r928 \rThen bade they make encampment before the forest green \rWhere game was like to issue, those hunters proud and. keen, \rWho there would join in hunting, on a meadow wide that spread. \rThither also was come Siegfried: the same unto the king was said. \r\r929 \rBy the merry huntsmen soon were watched complete \rAt every point the runways. The company then did greet \rSiegfried the keen and doughty: ""Who now within the green \rUnto the game shall guide us, ye warriors so bold and keen?" \r\r"Now part we from each other," answered Hagen then, \r"Ere that the hunting we do here begin! \rThereby may be apparent to my masters and to me \rWho on this forest journey of the hunters best may be. \r\r93 1 \r"Let then hounds and huntsmen be ta\'en in equal share, \r\rThat wheresoever any would go, there let him fare. \r\rWho then is first in hunting shall have our thanks tins day." \r\rNot longer there together did the merry hunters stay. \r\r932 \rThereto quoth Sir Siegfried: "Of dogs have I no need, \rMore than one hound only of trusty hunting breed \rFor scenting well the runway of wild beast through the brake. \rAnd now the chase begin we!" \xc3\x91 so the spouse of Kriemhild spake \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED WAS SLAIN 139 \r\r933 \rThen took a practised hunter a good tracking-hound, \r\rThat did bring them where they game in plenty found, \r\rNor kept them long awaiting. Whate\'er did spring from lair \r\rPursued the merry huntsmen, as still good hunters everywhere. \r\r934 \rAs many as the hound started slew with mighty hand \r\rSiegfried the full doughty hero of Netherland. \r\rSo swiftly went his charger that none could him outrun; \r\rAnd praise before all others soon he in the hunting won. \r\r935 \rHe was in every feature a valiant knight and true. \r\rThe first within the forest that with his hand he slew \r\rWas a half-grown wild-boar that he smote to ground; \r\rThereafter he full quickly a wild and mighty lion found. \r\r936 \rWhen it the hound had started, with bow he shot it dead, \rWherewith a pointed arrow he had so swiftly sped \rThat the lion after could forward spring but thrice. \rAll they that hunted with him cried Siegfried\'s praise with merry \rvoice. \r\r937 \rSoon fell a prey unto him an elk and bison more, \rA giant stag he slew him and huge ure-oxen four. \rHis steed bore him so swiftly that none could him outrun; \rOf stag or hind encountered scarce could there escape him one. \r\r938 \r\rA boar full huge and bristling soon was likewise found, \r\rAnd when the same bethought him to flee before the hound, \r\rCame quick again the master and stood athwart his path. \r\rThe boar upon the hero full charged straightway in mickle wrath. \r\r939 \rThen the spouse of Kriemhild, with sword the boar he slew, \rA thing that scarce another hunter had dared to do. \rWhen he thus had felled him they lashed again the hound, \rAnd soon his hunting prowess was known to all the people round. \r\r\r\ri4o SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r940 \rThen spake to him his huntsmen: "If that the thing may be, \rSo let some part, Sir Siegfried, of the forest game go free; \rTo-day thou makest empty hillside and forest wild." \rThereat in merry humor the thane so keen and valiant smiled. \r\r941 \rThen they heard on all sides the din, from many a hound . \rAnd huntsmen eke the clamor so great was heard around \rThat back did come the answer from hill and forest tree \xc3\x91 \rOf hounds had four-and-twenty packs been set by hunter free. \r\r942 \rFull many a forest denizen from life was doomed to part. \rEach of all the hunters thereon had set his heart, \rTo win the prize in hunting. But such could never be, \rWhen they the doughty Siegfried at the camping-place did see. \r\r943 \rNow the chase was ended, \xc3\x91 and yet complete \'twas not. \rAll they to camp who wended with them thither brought \rSkin of full many an animal and of game good store. \rHeigho! unto the table how much the king\'s attendants bore.\' \r\r944 \rThen bade the king the noble hunters all to warn \rThat he would take refreshment, and loud a hunting-horn \rIn one long blast was winded: to all was known thereby \rThat the noble monarch at camp did wait their company.\' \r\r945 \rSpake one of Siegfried\'s huntsmen: "Master, I do know \r\rBy blast of horn resounding that we now shall go \r\rUnto the place of meeting: thereto I\'ll make reply." \r\rThen for the merry hunters blew the horn right lustily. \r\r946 \rThen spake Sir Siegfried: "Now leave we eke the green." \rHis charger bore him smoothly, and followed huntsmen keen. \rWith their rout they started a beast of savage kind, \rThat was a bear untamed. Then spake the knight to those behind: \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED WAS SLAIN * 141 \r\r947 \r"For our merry party some sport will I devise. \r\rLet slip the hound then straightway, a bear now meets my eyes, \r\rAnd with us shall he thither unto the camp-fire fare. \r\rFull rapid must his flight be shall he our company forbear." \r\r948 \rFrom leash the hound was loosened, the bear sprang through the \r\rbrake, \rWhen that the spouse of Kriemhild did wish him to o\'ertake. \rHe sought a pathless thicket, but yet it could not be, \rAs bruin fondly hoped it, that from the hunter he was free. \r\r949 \rThen from his horse alighted the knight of spirit high, \rAnd gan a running after. Bruin all unguardedly \rWas ta\'en, and could escape not. Him caught straightway the knight, \rAnd soon all unwounded had him bound in fetters tight. \r\r95\xc2\xa1 \rNor^^ws nor teeth availed him for aught of injury, \r\rButiRund he was to saddle. Then mounted speedily \r\rThe knight, and to the camp-fire in right merry way \r\rFor pastime led he bruin, the hero valiant and gay. \r\r95i \rIn what manner stately unto the camp he rode! \r\rHe bore a spear full mickle, great of strength and broad. \r\rA sword all ornamented hung down unto his spur, \r\rAnd wrought of gold all ruddy at side a glittering horn he wore. \r\r952 \rOf richer hunting-garments heard I ne\'er tell before. \rBlack was the silken tunic that the rider wore, \rAnd cap of costly sable did crown the gallant knight. \rHeigho, and how his quiver with well- wrought bands was rich bedight! \r\r953 \rA skin of gleaming panther covered the quiver o\'er, \r\rPrized for its pleasant odor. Eke a bow he bore, \r\rThe which to draw if ever had wished another man, \r\rA lever he had needed: such power had Siegfried alone. ? \r\r\r\ri 4 2 SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r954 \rOf fur of costly otter his mantle was complete, \rWith other skins embroidered from head unto the feet. \rAnd \'mid the fur all shining, full many a golden seam \rOn both sides of the valiant huntsman saw ye brightly gleam. \r\r955 \rBalmung, a goodly weapon broad, he also wore, \r\rThat was so sharp at edges that it ne\'er forbore \r\rTo cleave when swung on helmet: blade it was full good. \r\rStately was the huntsman as there with merry heart he rode. \r\r956 \rIf that complete the story to you I shall unfold, \rFull many a goodly arrow did his rich quiver hold \rWhereof were gold the sockets, and heads a hand-breadth each. \rIn sooth was doomed to perish whate\'er in flight the same did reach. \r\r957 \rPricking like goodly huntsman the noble knight did ride \rWhen him the men of Gunther coming thither spied. \rThey hasted out to meet him and took from him his steed, \rAs bruin great and mighty by the saddle he did lead. \r\r958 \rWhen he from horse alighted he loosed him every band \rFrom foot and eke from muzzle. Straight on every hand \rBegan the dogs a howling when they beheld the bear. \rBruin would to the forest: among the men was mickle stir. \r\r959 \rAmid the clamor bruin through the camp-fires sped: \r\rFfeigho, how the servants away before him fled! \r\rO\'erturned was many a kettle and flaming brands did fly: \r\rHeigho, what goodly victuals did scattered in the ashes lie! \r\r960 \rThen sprang from out the saddle knights and serving-men. \rThe bear was wild careering: the king bade loosen then \rAll the dogs that fastened within their leashes lay. \rIf this thing well had ended, then had there passed a merry day \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED WAS SLAIN H3 \r\r\r\rNot longer then they waited but with bow and eke with spear \rHasted the nimble hunters to pursue the bear, \rYet none might shoot upon him for all the dogs around, \rluchdamor was of voices that all the mountam did resound. \r\r962 \rWhen bv the dogs pursued the bear away did run, \rNone there that could o\'ertake him but Siegfried alone \rWhh ht stord he came upon him and killed him at a blow, \rAnd back unto the camp-fire bearing brum they did go. \r\r963 \rThen spake who there had seen it, he was a man of might. \rSoon to the table bade they come each noble knight, \rAnd on a smiling meadow the noble company sat. \rHdgho, wrth whit rare victuals did they upon the huntsmen wart! \r\r964 \rNe\'er appeared a butler wine for them to pour. \rThan they good knights were never better served before, \rAnd had there not in secret been lurking treachery \rThen were the entertainers from every cause of cavil free. \r\r9 6 5 \rThen spake Sir Siegfried: "A wonder \'tis to me, \rSince that from the kitchen so full supplied are we, \rWhy to us the butlers of wine bring not like store: \rIfsuch the huntsman\'s service a huntsman reckon me no more. \r\r966 \r"Meseems I yet did merit some share of courtesy." \rThe king who sat at table spake then in treachery: \r"Gladly shall be amended wherein we\'re guilty so \rThe fault it is of Hagen, he\'d willing see us thirsting go. \r\r967 \rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "Good master, hear me say, \rI weened for this our hunting we did go to-day \rUnto the Spessart forest: the wine I thither sent \rGo we to-day a-thirsting, I\'ll later be more prWervt. \r\r\r\r144 SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r968 \r\rThereto replied Sir Siegfried: "Small merit here is thine. \rGood seven horses laden with mead and sparkling wine \rShould hither have been conducted. If aught the same denied, \rThen should our place of meeting have nearer been the Rhine \rbeside." \r\r969 \r\rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "Ye noble knights and bold, \rI know here nigh unto us a spring that\'s flowing cold. \rBe then your wrath appeased, and let us thither go." \rThrough that same wicked counsel came many a thane to grievous \rwoe. \r\r970 \r\rSore was the noble Siegfried with the pangs of thirst: \rTo bid them rise from table was he thus the first. \rHe would along the hillside unto the fountain go: \rIn sooth they showed them traitors, those knights who there did \rcounsel so. \r\r971 \r\rOn wagons hence to carry the game they gave command \rWhich had that day been slaughtered by Siegfried\'s doughty hand. \rHe\'d carried off the honors, all who had seen did say. \rHagen his faith with Siegfried soon did break in grievous way. \r\r972 \r\rWhen now they would go thither to where the linden spread, \r\rSpake of Tronje Hagen: "To me hath oft been said, \r\rThat none could follow after Kriemhild\'s nimble knight \r\rOr vie with him in running : would that he\'d prove it to our sight !

Where bow and sword there lay, \rBoth did carry Hagen from him thence away, \rAnd again sprang quickly thither where the spear did stand: \rAnd for a cross the tunic of the valiant knight he scanned. \r\r\r\rJ 46 SIXTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r981 \rAs there the noble Siegfried to drink o\'er fountain bent \rThrough the cross he pierced him, that from the wound\' was sen \r1 he blood nigh to bespatter the tunic Hagen wore \rBy hand of knight such evil deed shall wrought be nevermore. \r\r982 \rThe spear he left projecting where it had pierced the heart \rIn terror as that moment did Hagen never start \rIn flight from any warrior he ever yet had found \rSoon as the noble Siegfried within him felt the mighty wound, \r\r983 \rRaging the knight full doughty up from the fountain sprang, \rThe while from \'twixt his shoulders stood out a spearshaft long. \rThe prince weened to find there his bow or his sword- \rThen m sooth had Hagen found the traitor\'s meet reward. \r\r984 \rWhen from the sorely wounded knight his sword was gone, \rI hen had he naught to \'venge him but his shield alone \rThis snatched he from the fountain and Hagen rushed upon \rAnd not at all escape him could the royal Gunther\'s man. \r\r985 \rThough he nigh to death was wounded he yet such might did wield \rI hat out in all directions flew from off the shield \rPrecious stones a many: the shield he clave in twain. \rThus vengeance fain had taken upon his foe the stately thane. \r\r986 \rBeneath his hand must Hagen stagger and fall to ground. \rSo swift the blow he dealt him, the meadow did resound \rHad sword in hand been swinging, Hagen had had his meed, \rbo sorely raged he stricken; to rage in sooth was mickle need. \r\r987 \rFaded from cheek was color, no longer could he stand, \rAnd all his might of body soon complete had waned, \rAs did a deathly pallor over his visage creep. \rFull many a fairest lady for the knight anon must weep. \r\r\r\rSIEGFRIED WAS SLAIN 147 \r\r988 \rSo sank amid the flowers Kriemhild\'s noble knight, \rWhile from his wound flowed thickly the blood before the sight. \rThen gan he reviling \xc3\x91 for dire was his need \xc3\x91 \rWho had thus encompassed his death by this same faithless deed, \r\r989 \rThen spake the sorely wounded: "O ye base cowards twain, \rDoth then my service merit that me ye thus have slain? \rTo you I e\'er was faithful and so am I repaid. \rAlas, upon your kindred now have ye shame eternal laid. \r\r990 \r" By this deed dishonored hereafter evermore \rAre their generations.

\r\r1066 \rEre that the wife of Siegfried was come unto the grave, \rWith water from the fountain full oft her face they lave, \rSo struggled with her sorrow the faithful lady fair. \rGreat beyond all measure was the grief that she did bear. \r\r1067 \rIt was a mickle wonder that e\'er her life she kept. \rMany a lady was there that helped her as she wept. \rThen spake the queen full noble: "Ye men that service owe \rTo Siegfried, as ye love me, now to me a mercy show. \r\r1068 \r"Upon this sorrow grant ye the little grace to me \rThat I his shining visage yet once more may see." \rSo filled she was with anguish and so long time she sought, \rPerforce they must break open the casket all so fairly wroug] \r\r1069 \rWhere she did see him lying they then the lady led. \rWith hand full white and spotless raised she his fair head; \rThen kissed she there all lifeless the good and noble knight,- \rAnd wept so that for sorrow ran blood from out her eyes so b \r\r1070 \rMournful was the parting that then did rend the twain. \rThence away they bore her, nor might she walk again, \rBut in a swoon did senseless the stately lady lie. \rIn sooth her winsome body for sorrow sore was like to die. \r\r\r\rHOW KRIEMHILD MOURNED FOR SIEGFRIED 159 \r\r1071 \rWhen they the knight full noble now in the grave had laid, \rBeheld ye every warrior beyond all measure sad \rThat with him was come hither from Nibelung country. \rFull seldom joyous-hearted might ye royal Siegmund see. \r\r1072 \rAnd many were among them that for sorrow great \rTill three days were over did nor drink nor eat. \rYet might they not their bodies long leave uncared-for so: \rFor food they turned from mourning as people still are wont to do. \r\r\r\rEIGHTEENTH ADVENTURE \rIbow SiegmunD fareD fbome &gatn \r\r1073 \rThen went royal Siegmund where he Kriemhild found. \r\rUnto the queen spake he: "Home must we now be bound. \r\rWe ween that guests unwelcome here are we by the Rhine. \r\rKriemhild, beloved lady, come now to country that is mine. \r\r1074 \r" Though from us hath been taken by foul traitor\'s hand \rThy good spouse and noble here in stranger land, \rThine be it not to suffer: good friend thou hast in me \rFor sake of son beloved : thereof shalt thou undoubting be. \r\r1075 \r" Eke shalt thou have, good lady, all the power to hold, \rThe which erstwhile hath shown thee Siegfried the thane full bold. \rThe land and the crown likewise, be they thine own to call, \rAnd gladly eke shall serve thee Siegfried\'s doughty warriors all." \r\r1076 \rThen did they tell the servants that they thence would ride, \rAnd straight to fetch the horses these obedient hied. \r\'Mid such as so did hate them it grieved them more to stay: \rLadies high and maidens were bidden dress them for the way. \r\r\r\r160 EIGHTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r1077 \rWhen that for royal Siegmund stood ready horse and man, \rHer kinsmen Lady Kriemhild to beseech began \rThat she from her mother would still forbear to go. \rThen spake the lofty lady: "That might hardly yet be so. \r\r1078 \r"How might I for ever look with eyes upon \rHim that to me, poor woman, such evil thing hath done?" \rThen spake the youthful Giselher: "Sister to me full dear, \rBy thy goodness shalt thou tarry with thy mother here." \r\r1079 \r"Who in this wise have harmed thee and so grieved thy heart, \rThyself may\'st spurn their service: of what is mine take part." \rUnto the knight she answered: "Such thing may never be. \rFor die I must for sorrow when that Hagen I should see." \r\r1080 \r"From need thereof I\'ll save thee, sister full dear to me, \rFor with thy brother Giselher shalt thou ever be. \rI\'ll help to still thy sorrow that thy husband lieth dead." \rThen spake she sorrow-stricken: "Thereof in sooth had Kriemhild \rneed." \r\r1081 \rWhen that the youthful Giselher such kindly offer made, \rThen her mother Ute and Gemot likewise prayed, \rAnd all her faithful kinsmen, that she would tarry there: \rFor that in Siegfried\'s country but few of her own blood there were. \r\r1082 \r" To thee they all are strangers," did Gemot further say. \rNor lived yet man so mighty but dead at last he lay. \rBethink thee that, dear sister, in comfort of thy mood. \rStay thou amid thy kinsmen, I counsel truly for thy good." \r\r1083 \rTo Giselher she promised that she would tarry there. \rFor the men of Siegmund the horses ready were, \rWhen they thence would journey to the Nibelungen land: \rOn carrying-horses laden the knights\' attire did ready stand. \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGMUND FARED HOME AGAIN 161 \r\r1084 \rWent the royal Siegmund unto Kriemhild then; \rHe spake unto the lady: "Now do Siegfried\'s men \rAwait thee by the horses. Straight shall we hence away, \rFor \'mid the men of Burgundy unwilling would I longer stay." \r\r1085 \rThen spake the Lady Kriemhild: " My friends have counselled me, \rThat by the love I bear them, here my home shall be, \rFor that no kinsmen have I in the Nibelungen land." \rGrieved full sore was Siegmund when he did Kriemhild understand. \r\r1086 \rThen spake the royal Siegmund: "To such give not thine ear, \rA queen \'mid all my kinsmen, thou a crown shalt wear \rAnd wield as lordly power as e\'er till now thou hast. \rNor thou a whit shalt forfeit, that we the hero thus have lost. \r\r1087 \r"And journey with us thither, for child\'s sake eke of thine: \rHim shalt thou never, lady, an orphan leave to pine. \rWhen hath grown thy son to manhood, he\'ll comfort thee thy mood. \rMeanwhile shall ready serve thee many a warrior keen and good." \r\r1088 \rShe spake: "O royal Siegmund, I may not thither ride, \rFor I here must tarry, whate\'er shall me betide, \r\'Mid them that are my kinsmen, who\'ll help my grief to share." \rThe knights had sore disquiet that such tidings they must hear. \r\r1089 \r"So might we say full truly," spake they every one, \r"That unto us still greater evil now were done, \rWould\' st thou longer tarry here amid our foes: \rIn sooth were never journey of knights to court more full of woes." \r\r1090 \r"Now may ye free from trouble in God\'s protection fare: \rI\'ll bid that trusty escort shall you have in care \rUnto Siegmund\'s country. My child full dear to me, \rUnto your knights\' good mercy let it well commended be." \r\r\r\r1 62 EIGHTEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1091 \r\rWhen that they well perceived how she would not depart, \rWept all the men of Siegmund and sad they were at heart. \rIn what right heavy sorrow Siegmund then took leave \rOf the Lady Kriemhild! Full sore thereover must he grieve. \r\r1092 \r"Woe worth this journey hither," the lofty monarch spake. \r"Henceforth from merry meeting shall nevermore o\'ertake \rKing or his faithful kinsmen what here our meed hath been. \rHere \'mid the men of Burgundy may we never be more seen." \r\r1093 \rThen spake the men of Siegfried in open words and plain: \r"An might we right discover who our lord hath slain, \rWarriors bent on vengeance shall yet lay waste this ground. \rAmong his kin in plenty may doughty foemen be found." \r\r1094 \rAnon he kissed Kriemhild and spake sorrowfully, \rWhen she there would tarry, and he the same did see: \r"Now ride we joy-forsaken home unto our land. \rFirst now what \'tis to sorrow do I rightly understand." \r\rFrom Worms away sans escort unto the Rhine they rode: \r\rI ween that they full surely did go in such grim mood, \r\rThat had against them any aught of evil dared, \r\rHand of keen Nibelungen had known full well their life to guard. \r\r1096 \rNor parting hand they offered to any that were there. \rThen might ye see how Gemot and likewise Giselher \rDid give him loving greeting. That as their very own \rThey felt the wrong he suffered, by the courteous knights and brave \rwas shown. \r\r1097 \rThen spake in words full kindly the royal knight Gemot: \r" God in heaven knoweth that of guilt I\'ve naught \rIn the death of Siegfried, that e\'er I e\'en did hear \rWI-lo here to him were hostile. Well may I of thy sorrow share." \r\r\r\rHOW SIEGFRIED FARED HOME AGAIN 163 \r\r1098 \rAn escort safe did furnish the young knight Giselher: \rForth from out that country he led them full of care, \rThe monarch with his warriors, to Netherland their home. \rHow joyless is the greeting as thither to their kin they come! \r\r1099 \rHow fared that folk thereafter, that can I nowise say. \rHere heard ye Kriemhild plaining as day did follow day, \rThat none there was to comfort her heart and sorry mood, \rDid Giselher not do it ; he faithful was to her and good. \r\r1100 \rThe while the fair Queen Brunhild in mood full haughty sat, \rAnd weep howe\'er did Kriemhild, but little recked she that, \rNor whit to her of pity displayed she evermore. \rAnon was Lady Kriemhild eke cause to her of sorrow sore. \r\r\r\rNINETEENTH ADVENTURE \rfjow tbe IRtbelungen Iboaro waa JBrougbt to THUorms \r\rIIOI \r\rWhen that the noble Kriemhild thus did widowed stand, \rRemained there with his warriors by her in that land \rEckewart the margrave, and served her ever true. \rAnd he did help his mistress oft to mourn his master too. \r\r1102 \rAt Worms a house they built her the minster high beside, \rThat was both rich and spacious, full long and eke full wide, \rWherein with her attendants joyless did she dwell. \rShe sought the minster gladly, \xc3\x91 that to do she loved full well. \r\r1 103 \rSeldom undone she left it, but thither went alway \rIn sorry mood where buried her loved husband lay. \rGod begged she in his mercy his soul in charge to keep, \rAnd, to the thane right faithful, for him full often did she weep. \r\r\r\r1 64 NINETEENTH ADVENTURE. \r\r1 104 \rUte and her attendants all times a comfort bore, \rBut yet her heart was stricken and wounded all so sore \rThat no whit might avail it what solace e\'er they brought. \rFor lover taken from her with such grief her heart was fraught, \r\r1105 \rAs ne\'er for spouse beloved a wife did ever show. \rThereby how high in virtue she stood ye well might know. \rShe mourned until her ending and while did last her life. \rAnon a mighty vengeance wreaked the valiant Siegfried\'s wife. \r\r1 106 \r\rAnd so such load of sorrow for her dead spouse she bore, \rThe story sayeth truly, for years full three or more, \rNor ever unto Gunther any word spake she, \rAnd meantime eke her enemy Hagen never might she see. \r\r1 107 \r\rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "Now seek\'st thou such an end, \rThat unto thee thy sister be well-disposed friend? \rThen Nibelungen treasure let come to this country: \rThereof thou much might\'st win thee, might Kriemhild friendly- \rminded be." \r\r1 108 \r\rHe spake: "Be that our effort. My brothers\' love hath she: \rThem shall we beg to win her that she our friend may be, \rAnd that she gladly see it that we do share her store." \r"I trow it well," spake Hagen, "may such thing be nevermore." \r\r1 109 \r\rThen did he Ortwein unto the court command \r\rAnd the margrave Gere. When both were found at hand, \r\rThither brought they Gemot and eke young Giselher. \r\rIn friendly manner sought they to win the Lady Kriemhild there. \r\r1 1 10 \r\rThen spake of Burgundy Gemot the warrior strong: \r"Lady, the death of Siegfried thou mournest all too long. \rWell will the monarch prove thee that him he ne\'er hath slain. \r\'Tis heard how that right sorely thou dost for him unending plain." \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGEN HOARD BROUGHT TO WORMS 165 \r\rmi \rShe spake: "The king none chargeth: t\'was Hagen\'s hand that \r\rslew. \rWhen Hagen me did question where might one pierce him through, \rHow might e\'er thought come to me that hate his heart did bear? \rThen \'gainst such thing to guard me," spake she, " had I ta\'en good \r\rcare. \r\r1112 \r\r"And kept me from betraying to evil hands his life, \r\rNor cause of this my weeping had I his poor lorn wife. \r\rMy heart shall hate forever who this foul deed have done." \r\rAnd further to entreat her young Giselher had soon begun. \r\r1113 \r\rWTien that to greet the monarch a willing mind spake she, \r\rHim soon with noble kinsmen before her might ye see. \r\rYet dare might never Hagen unto her to go: \r\rOn her he\'d wrought sore evil, as well his guilty mind did know. \r\r1114 \r\rWhen she no hatred meted unto Gunther as before, \r\rBy Hagen to be greeted were fitting all the more. \r\rHad but by his counsel no ill to her been done, \r\rSo might he all undaunted unto Kriemhild have gone. \r\r1115 \rNor e\'er was peace new offered kindred friends among \r\rSealed with tears so many. She brooded o\'er her wrong. \r\rTo all she gave her friendship save to one man alone. \r\rNor slain her spouse were ever, were not the deed by Hagen done. \r\r1116 \rSmall time it was thereafter ere they did bring to pass \rThat with the Lady Kriemhild the mighty treasure was, \rThat from Nibelungen country she brought the Rhine unto. \rIt was her bridal portion and \'twas fairly now her due. \r\r1117 \rFor it did journey thither Gemot and Giselher. \rWarriors eighty hundred Kriemhild commanded there \rThat they should go and fetch it where hidden it did lie, \rAnd where the good thane Alberich with friends did guard it faithfully. \r\r\r\r166 NINETEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1118 \rWhen saw they coming warriors from Rhine the hoard to take, \rAlberich the full valiant to his friends in this wise spake: \r"We dare not of the treasure aught from them withhold: \rIt is her bridal portion, \xc3\x91thus the noble queen hath told. \r\rIIIQ \r\r"Yet had we never granted," spake Alberich, "this to do, \r\rBut that in evil manner the sightless mantle too \r\rWith the doughty Siegfried we alike did lose, \r\rThe which did wear at all times the fa^r Kriemhild\'s noble spouse. \r\r1120 \r"Now alas hath Siegfried had but evil gain \rThat from us the sightless mantle the hero thus hath ta\'en, \rAnd so hath forced to serve him all these lands around." \rThen went forth the porter where full soon the keys he found. \r\r1121 \rThere stood before the mountain ready Kriemhild\'s men, \rAnd her kinsmen with them. The treasure bore they then \rDown unto the water where the ships they sought: \rTo where the Rhine flowed downward across the waves the hoard \rthey brought. \r\r1122 \rNow of the treasure further may ye a wonder hear: \rHeavy wains a dozen scarce the same might bear \rIn four days and nights together from the mountain all away, \rE\'en did each one of them thrice the journey make each day. \r\r1123 \rIn it was nothing other than gold and jewels rare. \rAnd if to every mortal on earth were dealt a share, \rNe\'er \'twould make the treasure by one mark the \'less. \rNot without good reason forsooth would Hagen it possess. \r\r1 1 24 \rThe wish-rod lay among them, of gold a little wand. \rWhosoe\'er its powers full might understand, \rThe same might make him master o\'er all the race of men. \rOf Alberich\'s kin full many with Gemot returned a<*ain. \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGEN HOARD BROUGHT TO WORMS 167 \r\r1125 \rWhen they did store the treasure in King Gunther\'s land, \rAnd to royal Kriemhild \'twas given \'neath her hand, \rStoring-rooms and towers could scarce the measure hold. \rNevermore such wonder might of wealth again be told. \r\r1126 \rAnd had it e\'en been greater, yea a thousandfold, \rIf but again might Kriemhild safe her Siegfried hold, \rFain were she empty-handed of all the boundless store. \rSpouse than she more faithful won a hero nevermore. \r\r1127 \rWhen now she had the treasure, she brought into that land \rKnights many from far distance. Yea, dealt the lady\'s hand \rSo freely that such bounty ne\'er before was seen. \rHigh in honor held they for her goodly heart the queen. \r\r1128 \rUnto both rich and needy began she so to give \rThat fearful soon grew Hagen, if that she would live \rLong time in such high power, lest she of warriors true \rSuch host might win to serve her, that cause would be her strength \rto rue. \r\r1129 \rSpake Gunther then: "The treasure is hers and freedom too. \rWherefore shall I prevent her, whate\'er therewith she do? \rYea, nigh she did her friendship from me evermore withhold. \rNow reck we not who shareth or her silver or her gold." \r\r1130 \rUnto the king spake Hagen: "No man that boasteth wit \rShould to any woman such hoard to hold permit. \rBy gifts she yet will bring it that will come the day \rWhen valiant men of Burgundy rue it with good reason may." \r\r1131 \rThen spake the monarch Gunther: "To her an oath I swore, \rThat I would cause of evil to her be nevermore, \rWhereof henceforth I\'ll mind me: sister she is to me." \rThen spake further Hagen: "Let me bear the guilt for thee." \r\r\r\r1 68 NINETEENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1132 \rMany they were that kept not there their plighted word: \rFrom the widow took they all that mighty hoard: \rEvery key had Hagen known to get in hand. \rRage filled her brother Gemot when he the thing did understand. \r\r1133 \rThen spake the knight Giselher: "Hagen here hath wrought \rSore evil to my sister: permit this thing I\'ll not. \rAnd were he not my kinsman, he\'d pay it with his life." \rAnew did fall aweeping then the doughty Siegfried\'s wife. \r\r"34 \r\rThen spake the knight Gemot: "Ere that forever we \rBe troubled with this treasure, let first commanded be \rDeep in the Rhine to sink it, that no man have it more." \rIn sad manner plaining Kriemhild stood Giselher before. \r\r1135 \rShe spake: "Beloved brother, be mindful thou of me: \rWhat life and treasure toucheth shalt thou my protector be." \rThen spake he to the lady: "That shaU sure betide, \rWhen we again come hither: now called we are away to ride." \r\r1136 \rThe monarch and his kinsmen rode from out the land, \rAnd in his train the bravest ye saw on any hand: \rWent all save Hagen only, and there he stayed for hate, \rThat he did bear to Kriemhild, and full gladly did he that. \r\rEre that the mighty monarch was thither come again, \rIn that while had Hagen all that treasure ta\'en. \rWhere Loch is by the river all in the Rhine sank he. \rHe weened thereof to profit, yet such thing might never be. \r\r1138 \rThe royal knights came thither again with many a man. \rKriemhild with her maidens and ladies then began \rTo mourn the wrong they suffered, that pity was to hear. \rFain had the faithful Giselher been unto her a comforter. \r\r\r\rTHE NIBELUNGEN HOARD BROUGHT TO WORMS 169 \r\r"39 \rThen spake they all together: "Done hath he grievous wrong." \r\rBut he the princes\' anger avoided yet so long \r\rAt last to win their favor. They let him live sans scathe. \r\rThen filled thereat was Kriemhild as ne\'er before with mickle wrath. \r\r1 140 \rEre that of Tronje Hagen had hidden thus the hoard, \rHad they unto each other given firm plighted word, \rThat it should he concealed while one of them might live. \rThereof anon nor could they to themselves nor unto other give. \r\r1141 \rWith renewed sorrows heavy she was of heart \rThat so her dear-loved husband perforce from life must part, \rAnd that of wealth they reft her.

Full eager were his company \r\r1252 \rBy the knight to be informed how the thing befell, \rAnd if betimes they knew it \'twould please them all full well, \rFor weary was the journey and long unto their land. \rSoon did the noble Ruediger again in Kriemhild\'s presence stand. \r\r1253 \rIn full earnest manner then the knight gan pray \r\rThe high royal lady that she to him might say \r\rWhat were from her the message to Etzel he should bear. \r\rNaught but denial only did he from the lady hear, \r\r1254 \rFor that her love might never by man again be won. \rThereto spake the margrave: "111 such thing were done. \rWherefore such fair body wilt thou to ruin give? \rSpouse of knight full worthy may\'st thou yet in honor live." \r\r1255 \rNaught booted how they besought her, till that Ruediger \rSpake in secret manner in the high lady\'s ear, \rHow Etzel should requite her for ills she e\'er did know. \rThen gan her mickle sorrow milder at the thought to grow. \r\r1256 \rUnto the queen then spake he: "Let now thy weeping be. \rIf \'mong the Huns hadst thou other none than me \rAnd my faithful kinsmen and my good men alone, \rSorely must he repay it who hath aught to thee of evil done." \r\r\r\r186 TWENTIETH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1257 \rThereat apace aU lighter the lady\'s sorrow grew, \rShe spake: "So swear thou truly, what any \'gainst me do, \rThat thou wilt be the foremost my sorrows to requite " \rThereto spake the margrave: "Lady, to thee my word I plight." \r\r1258 \rWith all his men together sware then Ruediger \rFaithfully to serve her, and in all things whatsoe\'er \rNaught would e\'er deny her the thanes from Etzel\'s land \rWhereof she might have honor: thereto gave Ruediger his hand. \r\rI2 59 \rThen thought the faithful lady: "Since I thus have won \rBand of friends so faithful, care now have I none \rHow shall speak the people in my sore need of me. \rThe death of my loved husband perchance shall yet avenged be." \r\r1260 \rThought she: "Since hath Etzel so many knights and true, \rAn shall I but command them, whate\'er I will I do. \rEke hath he such riches that free may be my hand: \rBereft of all my treasure by Hagen\'s faithless art I stand." \r\r1261 \rThen spake she unto Ruediger: "Were it not, as I do know \rThe king is yet a heathen, so were I fain to go \rWhithersoe\'er he willed it, and take him for my lord " \rThereto spake the margrave: "Lady, no longer hold such word. \r\r1262 \r" Such host he hath of warriors who Christians are as we, \rThat beside the monarch may care ne\'er come to thee. \rYea, may he be baptized through thee to Christian life: \rWell may\'st thou then rejoice thee to be the royal Etzel\'s wife." \r\r1263 \rThen spake again her brother: "Sister, thy favor lend, \rThat now all thy sorrow thereby may have an end." \rAnd so long they besought her that full of sadness she \rHer word at length had plighted the monarch Etzel\'s wife to be. \r\r\r\rHOW KING ETZEL SENT FOR KRIEMHILD 187 \r\r1264 \rShe spake: "You will I follow, I most lorn lady, \rThat I fare to Hunland, as soon as it may be \rThat I friends have ready to lead me to his land." \rBefore the knights assembled fair Kriemhild pledged thereto her \rhand. \r\r1265 \rThen spake again the margrave : " Two knights do serve thee true, \rAnd I thereof have many: \'tis easy thing to do, \rThat thee with fitting honor across the Rhine we guide. \rNor shalt thou, lady, longer here in Burgundy abide. \r\r1266 \r" Good men have I five hundred, and eke my kinsmen stand \rReady here to serve thee and far in Etzel\'s land, \rLady, at thy bidding. And I do pledge the same, \rWhene\'er thou dost admonish, to serve thee without cause for shame. \r\r1267 \r"Now bid with full equipment thy horses to prepare: \rRuediger\'s true counsel will bring thee sorrow ne\'er; \rAnd tell it to thy maidens whom thou wilt take with thee. \rFull many a chosen warrior on the way shall join our company." \r\r1268 \rThey had full rich equipment that once their train arrayed \rThe while that yet lived Siegfried, so might she many a maid \rIn honor high lead with her, as she thence would fare. \rWhat steeds all rich caparisoned awaited the high ladies there! \r\r1269 \rIf till that time they ever in richest dress were clad, \rThereof now for their journey full store was ready made, \rFor that they of the monarch had such tidings caught. \rFrom chests longtime well bolted forth the treasures rich were \rbrought. \r\r1270 \rLittle were they idle until the fifth day, \rBut sought rich dress that folded secure in covers lay. \rKriemhild wide did open all her treasure there, \rAnd largess great would give she unto the men of Ruediger. \r\r\r\r188 TWENTIETH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1271 \rStill had she of the treasure of Nibelungenland, \r(She weened the same in Hunland to deal with bounteous hand) \rSo great that hundred horses ne\'er the whole might bear. \rHow stood the mind of Kriemhild, came the tidings unto Hagen\'s \r\r\r\rear. \r\r\r\r1272 \rHe spake: "Since Kriemhild never may me in favor hold, \rE\'en so here must tarry Siegfried\'s store of gold. \rWherefore unto mine enemies such mickle treasure go? \rWhat with the treasure Kriemhild intendeth, that full well I know. \r\r1273 \r"Might she but take it thither, in sooth believe I that, \r\'Twould be dealt out in largess to stir against me hate. \rNor own they steeds sufficient the same to bear away. \r\'Twill safe be kept by Hagen \xc3\x91so shall they unto Kriemhild say." \r\r1274 \rWhen she did hear the story, with grief her heart was torn. \rEke unto the monarchs all three the tale was borne. \rFain would they prevent it: yet when that might not be, \rSpake the noble Ruediger in this wise full joyfully: \r\rI2 75 \r"Wherefore, queen full stately, weep\'st thou o\'er this gold? \rFor thee will King Etzel in such high favor hold \rWhen but his eyes behold thee, to thee such store he\'ll give \rThat ne\'er thou may\'st exhaust it : that, 1 ady, by my word believe." \r\r1276 \rThereto the queen gave answer: "Full noble Ruediger, \rGreater treasure never king\'s daughter had for share \rThan this that Hagen from me now hath ta\'en away." \rThen went her brother Gemot to the chamber where the treasure \rlay. \r\r1277 \rWith force he stuck the monarch\'s key into the door, \rAnd soon of Kriemhild\'s treasure they from the chamber bore \rMarks full thirty thousand or e\'en more plenteously. \rHe bade the guests to take it, which pleased King Gunther well \rto see. \r\r\r\rHOW KING ETZEL SENT FOR KRIEMHILD 189 \r\r1278 \rThen Gotelinde\'s husband of Bechelaren spake: \r"An if my Lady Kriemhild with her complete might take \rWhat treasure e\'er came hither from Nibelungenland, \rNe\'er a whit would touch it mine or my royal lady\'s hand. \r\r1279 \r"Now bid them here to keep it, for ne\'er the same I\'ll touch. \rYea, brought I from my country of mine own wealth so much, \rThat we upon our journey may be full well supplied, \rAnd ne\'er have lack in outlay as in state we homeward ride." \r\r1280 \rChests well filled a dozen from the time of old \rHad for their own her maidens, of the best of gold \rThat e\'er ye might discover: now thence away \'twas borne, \rAnd jewels for the ladies upon the journey to be worn. \r\r1281 \rOf the might she yet was fearful of Hagen grim and bold. \rStill had she of mass-money a thousand marks in gold, \rThat gave she for the soul\'s rest of her husband dear. \rSuch loving deed and faithful did touch the heart of Ruediger. \r\r1282 \rThen spake the lady mournful: "Who now that loveth me, \rAnd for the love they bear me may willing exiles be, \rWho with me to Hunland now away shall ride? \rTake they of my treasure and steeds and meet attire provide." \r\r1283 \rThen did the margrave Eckewart answer thus the queen: \r"Since I from the beginning of thy train have been, \rHave I e\'er right faithful served thee," spake the thane, \r"And to the end I\'ll ever thus faithful unto thee remain. \r\r1284 \r"Eke will I lead with me five hundred of my men, \rWhom I grant to serve thee in faithful way again. \rNor e\'er shall we be parted till that we be dead." \rLow bowing thanked him Kriemhild, as verily might be his meed. \r\r\r\r190 TWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1285 \rForth were brought the horses, for that they thence would fare. \rThen was a mickle weeping of friends that parted there. \rUte, queen full stately, and many a lady more \rShowed that from Lady Kriemhild to part did grieve their hearts \rfull sore. \r\r1286 \rA hundred stately maidens with her she led away, \rAnd as for them was fitting, full rich was their array. \rMany a bitter tear-drop from shining eye fell down: \rYet joys knew they full many eke in Etzel\'s land anon. \r\r1287 \rThither came Sir Giselher and Gemot as well, \rAnd with them train of followers, as duty did compel. \rSafe escort would they furnish for their dear sister then, \rAnd with them led of warriors a thousand brave and stately men. \r\r1288 \rThen came the valiant Gere, and Ortwein eke came he: \rRumold the High Steward might not absent be. \rUnto the Danube did they night-quarters meet provide. \rShort way beyond the city did the royal Gunther ride. \r\r1289 \rEre from the Rhine they started had they forward sent \rMessengers that full quickly unto Hunland went, \rAnd told unto the monarch how that Ruediger \rFor spouse at length had won him the high-born queen beyond \rcompare. \r\rTWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE \r\rf)ow IKriembtlo fateo to tbe tmns \r\r1290 \rThe messengers leave we riding.

Many a shield full broad \rOn the way did guard the ladies in hand of valiant thane. \rFull many a stately warrior from thence did backward turn again. \r\rI2 95 \rThence away they hastened down through Bavarian land. \r\rSoon were told the tidings how that was at hand \r\rA mickle host of strangers, where a cloister stands from yore \r\rAnd where the Inn its torrent doth into Danube river pour. \r\r1296 \rAt Passau in the city a lordly bishop bode. \rEmpty soon each lodging and bishop\'s palace stood: \rTo Bavarian land they hastened the high guests to meet, \rAnd there the Bishop Pilgrim the Lady Kriemhild fair did greet. \r\r1297 \rThe warriors of that country no whit grieved they were \rThus to see follow with her so many a maiden fair. \rUpon those high-born ladies their eyes with joy did rest. \rFull comfortable quarters prepared they for each noble guest. \r\r\r\rTWENTY-FIRST ADVENTURE \r\r\r\rWith his niece the bishop unto Passau rode \r\rWhen among the ^^.^^^^^ full fair, \r\rThat thither was come Kriemhild the bisncp \xc3\x88s \r\rSoon did the towns-people reception meet for her prepare. \r\r1299 ; \r\rThere to have them tarry was the bishop fain. \rTo to spLe Sir Eckewart: "Here may we not remain. \r\rUnto Ruediger\'s country ^\xc2\xaa^^ well is known." \rThanes many there await us, to whom our comi g \r\r1300 \rThe tidings now knew hkewise Lady Gotelinde fair. \r\raould she unto Lady Kriemhild show such courtesy, \r\rI3 01 \r\rThat she ride forth to meet her, and bring his warriors true \rUnwartunto the Ense.

Full many a bow was drawn, \rAs at the flying wild-fowl through air the bolt was sped. \rWith might the bow was bended as far as to the arrow\'s head. \r\ri34i \rA city by the Danube in Osterland doth stand, \rHight the same is Tulna: of many a distant land \rSaw Kriemhild there the customs, ne\'er yet to her were known. \rTo many there did greet her sorrow befell through her anon. \r\r1342 \rBefore the monarch Etzel rode a company \rOf merry men and mighty, courteous and fair to see, \rGood four-and-twenty chieftains, mighty men and bold. \rNaught else was their desire save but their mistress to behold. \r\r1343 \rThen the Duke Ramung from far Wallachia \rWith seven hundred warriors dashed forth athwart her way. \rTheir going might ye liken unto birds in flight. \rThen came the chieftain Gibeke, with his host a stately sight. \r\rJ 344 \rEke the valiant Hornbog with full thousand men \rFrom the king went forward to greet his mistress then. \rAfter their country\'s custom in joy they shouted loud; \rThe doughty thanes of Hunland likewise in merry tourney rode. \r\rT , r 345 \r\rinen came a chief from Denmark, Hawart bold and keen, \r\rAnd the valiant Iring, in whom no guile was seen, \r\rAnd Irnfried of Thuringia, a stately knight to see: \r\rKriemhild they greeted that honor high therefrom had she, \r\r\r\rHOW ETZEL KEPT THE WEDDING-FEAST 199 \r\r1346 \rWith good knights twelve hundred whom led they in their train. \rThither with three thousand came Bloedel eke, the thane \rThat was King Etzel\'s brother out of Hunland: \rUnto his royal mistress led he then his stately band. \r\r1347 \rThen did come King Etzel and Dietrich by his side \r\rWith all his doughty fellows. In state there saw ye ride \r\rMany a knight full noble, valiant and void of fear. \r\rThe heart of Lady Kriemhild did such host of warriors cheer. \r\r1348 \rThen to his royal mistress spake Sir Ruediger: \r"Lady, now give I greeting to the high monarch here. \rWhom to kiss I bid thee, grant him such favor then: \rFor not to all like greeting may\'st thou give \'mid Etzel\'s men." \r\r1349 \rThey lifted then from saddle the dame of royal state. \rEtzel the mighty monarch might then no longer wait, \rBut sprang from off his charger with many a warrior keen: \rUnto Kriemhild hasting full joyously he then was seen. \r\r!35\xc2\xa1 \rAs is to us related, did there high princes twain \r\rBy the lady walking bear aloft her train, \r\rAs the royal Etzel went forward her to meet, \r\rAnd she the noble monarch with kiss in kindly wise did greet. \r\rJ35 1 \rAside she moved her wimple, whereat her visage fair \r\rGleamed \'mid the gold around it. Though many a knight stood \r\rthere, \r\rThey deemed that Lady Helke did boast not fairer face. \r\rFull close beside the monarch his brother Bloedel had his place. \r\ri35 2 \rTo kiss him then Margrave Ruediger her did tell, \r\rAnd eke the royal Gibeke and Sir Dietrich as well. \r\rOf highest knights a dozen did Etzel\'s spouse embrace; \r\rOther knights full many she greeted with a lesser grace. \r\r\r\r200 TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE \r\r1353 \rAll the while that Etzel stood by Kriemhild so, \r\rDid the youthful riders as still they\'re wont to do: \r\rIn varied tourney saw ye each \'gainst the other pass, \r\rChristian knights and heathen, as for each the custom was. \r\r_ 1354 \rFrom men that followed Dietrich saw ye in kindly wise \rSplinters from the lances flying high arise \rAloft above their bucklers, from hand of good knight sent! \rBy the German strangers pierced was many a shield and rent. \r\r1355 \rFrom shaft of lances breaking did far the din resound. \r\rTogether came the warriors from all the land around, \r\rEke the guests of the monarch and many a knight there was. \r\rThence did the mighty monarch then with Lady Kriemhild pass. \r\r1356 \rStretched a fair pavilion beside them there was seen: \rWith tents as well was covered all around the green, \rWhere they now might rest them all that weary were. \rBy high-born knights was thither led full many a lady fair \r\r1357 \rWith their royal mistress, where in rich cushioned chair \rSat the queen full stately. \'Twas by the margrave\'s care \rThat well had been provided, with all that seemed good, \rA worthy seat for Kriemhild: thereat was Etzel glad of mood. \r\r1358 \rWTiat was by Etzel spoken, may I not understand. \rIn his right hand resting lay her fair white hand. \rThey sat in loving fashion, nor Ruediger would let \rThe king have secret converse with Lady Kriemhild as yet. \r\r1359 \r\'Twas bidden that the jousting on all sides they give o\'er. \rThe din of stately tourney heard ye then no more. \rAll the men of Etzel unto their tents did go, \rFor every warrior present did they full spacious lodging show. \r\r\r\rHOW ETZEL KEPT THE WEDDING-FEAST 201 \r\r1360 \rAnd now the day was ended and they did rest the night \rUntil beheld they shining once more the morning light. \rSoon on charger mounted again was many a man: \rHeigho, what merry pastime, the king to honor, they began! \r\r1361 \rBy the Huns the monarch bade honors high be shown. \rSoon rode they forth from Tulna unto Vienna town, \rWhere found they many a lady decked out in fair array: \rThe same the monarch Etzel\'s wife received in stately way. \r\r1362 \rIn very fullest measure upon them there did wait \rWhate\'er they might desire. Of knights the joy was great, \rLooking toward the revel. Lodging then sought each one. \rThe wedding of the monarch was in merry wise begun. \r\r1363 \rYet not for all might lodging within the town be had. \r\rAll that were not strangers, Ruediger them bade \r\rThat they find them lodgings beyond the city\'s bound. \r\rI ween that at all seasons by Lady Kriemhild\'s side was found \r\ri3 6 4 \rThe noble Sir Dietrich and many another thane, \rWho amid their labors but little rest had ta\'en, \rThat the guests they harbored of merry mood should be. \rFor Ruediger and his companions went the time full pleasantly. \r\r1365 \rThe wedding time was fallen upon a Whitsuntide, \rWnen the monarch Etzel lay Kriemhild beside \rIn the town at Vienna. So many men I ween \rThrough her former husband had not in her service been. \r\r1366 \rMany that ne\'er had seen her did her rich bounty take, \rAnd many a one among them unto the strangers spake: \r"We deemed that Lady Kriemhild of wealth no more had aught \rNow hath she by her giving here full many a wonder wrought." \r\r\r\r202 TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1367 \rThe wedding-feast it lasted for days full seventeen. \rNe\'er of other monarch hath any told, I ween, \rThat wedded with more splendor: of such no tale we hear. \rAll that there were present, new-made apparel did they wear. \r\r1368 \rI ween that far in Netherland sat she ne\'er before \rAmid such host of warriors. And this believe I more: \rWas Siegfried rich in treasure, that yet he ne\'er did gain, \rAs here she saw \'fore Etzel, so many a high and noble thane. \r\r1369 \rNor e\'er gave any other at his own wedding-tide \rSo many a costly mantle flowing long and wide, \rNor yet so rich apparel \xc3\x91 so may ye well believe \xc3\x91 \rAs here from hand of Kriemhild did they one and all receive. \r\r1370 \rHer friends and eke the strangers were of a single mind, \rThat they would not be sparing of treasure in any kind: \rWhat any from them desired, they gave with willing hand. \rMany a thane from giving himself of clothing reft did stand. \r\ri37i \rHow by her noble husband at the Rhine a queen she sat, \rOf that she still was minded, and her eye grew wet thereat. \rYet well she kept it hidden that none the same might mark. \rNow had she wealth of honor after long years of sorrow dark. \r\r1372 \rWhat any did with bounty, \'twas but an idle wind \rBy side of Dietrich\'s giving: what Etzel\'s generous mind \rBefore to him had given, complete did disappear. \rEke wrought there many a wonder the hand of bounteous Ruediger. \r\r1373 \rBloedelein the chieftain that came from Hunland, \r\rFull many a chest to empty did he then command, \r\rOf gold and eke of silver. That did they freely give. \r\rRight merrily the warriors of the monarch saw ye live. \r\r\r\rHOW ETZEL KEPT THE WEDDING-FEAST 20 \r\r\r\r.5 \r\r\r\r1374 \rLikewise the monarch\'s minstrels Werbel and Schwemmelein, \rWon they at the wedding each alone, I ween, \rMarks a good thousand or even more than that, \rWhenas fair Lady Kriemhild \'neath crown by royal Etzel sat. \r\r*375 \r\rUpon the eighteenth morning from Vienna town they went. \r\rThen in knightly pastime many a shield was rent \rBy spear full well directed by doughty rider\'s hand. \rSo came the royal Etzel riding into Hunland. \r\r1376 \rAt Heimburg\'s ancient castle they tarried over night. \rTell the tale of people no mortal ever might, \rAnd the number of good warriors did o\'er the country come. \rAh, what fairest women were gathered unto Etzel\'s home! \r\r1377 \rBy Miesenburg\'s majestic towers did they embark. \r\rWith horses eke and riders the water all was dark, \r\rAs if \'twere earth they trod on, as far as eye might see. \r\rThe way-worn ladies rested now on board right pleasantly. \r\r1378 \rNow was lashed together many a boat full good, \rThat no harm they suffered from the waves and flood. \rMany a stately awning likewise above them spread, \rJust as if beneath them had they land and flowery mead. \r\r1379 \rWhen to Etzelburg the tidings soon were borne along, \r\rTherein of men and women were seen a merry throng. \r\rWho once the Lady Helke as mistress did obey, \r\rAnon by Lady Kriemhild lived they many a gladsome day. \r\r1380 \rThere did stand expectant full many a maid high-born, \rThat since the death of Helke had pined all forlorn. \rDaughters of seven monarchs Kriemhild there waiting found, \rThat were the high adornment of all King Etzel\'s country round. \r\r\r\r2o 4 TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE \r\r1381 \rHerrat, a lofty princess, did all the train obey, \rSister\'s child to Helke, in whom high virtues lay, \rBetrothed eke of Dietrich, of royal lineage born, \rDaughter of King Nentwein; her did high honors eft adorn. \r\r1382 \rAgainst the strangers\' coming her heart with joy flowed o\'er: \rEke was thereto devoted of wealth a mickle store. \rWho might e\'er give the picture, how the king eft sat on throne ? \rNor had with any mistress the Huns such joyous living known. \r\r1383 \rAs with his spouse the monarch up from the river came, \r\rUnto the noble Kriemhild of each they told the name \r\r\'Mong them that she did find there: she fairer each did greet. \r\rAh, how mighty mistress she long did sit in Helke\'s seat! \r\r1384 \rReady and true the service to her was offered there. \rThe queen dealt out in plenty gold and raiment rare, \rSilver eke and jewels. What over Rhine she brought \rWith her unto Hunland, soon thereof retained she naught. \r\r1385 \rEke in faithful service she to herself did win \r\rAll the king\'s warriors and all his royal kin, \r\r\xc3\x91 So that ne\'er did Lady Helke so mighty power wield \r\rAs until death to Kriemhild such host did willing service yield. \r\r1386 \rThus stood so high in honor the \'court and country round, \rThat there at every season was pleasant pastime found \rBy each, whithersoever his heart\'s desire might stand: \rThat wrought the monarch\'s favor and the queen\'s full bounteous \rhand. \r\r\r\rKRIEMHILD\'S THOUGHT OF VENGEANCE 205 \r\rTWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE \r1bow Ikrtembilo tbougbt to avenge ber l&rong \r\r1387 \rIn full lordly honor, \xc3\x91 truth is that ye hear \xc3\x91 \rDwelt they with each other until the seventh year. \rMeanwhile Lady Kriemhild a son to Etzel bore, \rNor gladder might the monarch be o\'er aught for evermore. \r\r1388 \rYet would she not give over, nor with aught be reconciled, \rBut that should be baptized the royal Etzel\'s child \rAfter Christian custom: Ortlieb they did him call. \rThereat was mickle joyance over Etzel\'s borders all. \r\r1389 \rWhate\'er of highest virtues in Lady Helke lay, \r\rStrove the Lady Kriemhild to rival her each day. \r\rHerrat the stranger maiden many a grace she taught, \r\rWho yet with secret pining for her mistress Helke was distraught. \r\r1390 \rTo stranger and to native full well she soon was known, \rNe\'er monarch\'s country, said they, did royal mistress own \rThat gave with freer bounty; that held they without fear. \rSuch praise she bore in Hunland, until was come the thirteenth \ryear. \r\ri39i \rNow had she well perceived how all obeyed her will, \r\rAs service to royal mistress king\'s knights do render still, \r\rAnd how at every season twelve kings \'fore her were seen. \r\rShe thought of many a sorrow that wrought upon her once had been. \r\r1392 \rEke thought she of lordly power in Nibelungenland \rThat she erstwhile had wielded, and how that Hagen\'s hand \rOf it all had reft her with her lord Siegfried dead; \rShe thought for so great evil how might he ever be repaid. \r\r\r\r2o6 TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1393 \r" \'Twould be, might I but bring him hither into this land." \rShe dreamed that fondly led her full often by the hand \rGiselher her brother, full oft in gentle sleep \rThought she to have kissed him, wherefrom he sorrow soon must \rreap. \r\r1394 \rI ween the evil demon was Kriemhild\'s counsellor \rThat she her peace with Gunther should sacred keep no more, \rWhom she kissed in friendly token in the land of Burgundy. \rAdown upon her bosom the burning tears fell heavily. \r\r1395 \rOn her heart both late and early lay the heavy thought, \rHow that, herself all guiltless, thereto she had been brought, \rThat she must share in exile a heathen monarch\'s bed. \rThrough Hagen eke and Gunther come she was to such sore need, \r\r1396 \rFrom her heart such longing seldom might she dismiss. \rThought she: " A queen so mighty I am o\'er wealth like this, \rThat I upon mine enemies may yet avenge me well. \rFain were I that on Hagen of Tronje yet my vengeance fell. \r\r1397 \r"For friends that once were faithful full oft my heart doth long. \rWere they but here beside me that wrought on me such wrong, \rThen were in sooth avenged my lover reft of life; \rScarce may I bide that hour," spake the royal Etzel\'s wife. \r\r1398 \rKriemhild they loved and honored, the monarch\'s men each one \rAs they that came there with her: well might the same be done. \rThe treasure wielded Eckewart, and won good knights thereby. \rThe will of Lady Kriemhild might none in all that land deny. \r\r1399 \rShe mused at every season: "The king himself I\'ll pray,"\xc3\x91 \rThat he to her the favor might grant in friendly way, \rTo bring her kinsmen hither unto Hunland. \rWhat vengeful thought she cherished might none soever understanc \r\r\r\rKRIEMHILD\'S THOUGHT OF VENGEANCE 207 \r\r1400 \rAs she in stillest night-time by the monarch lay \r(In his arms enclosed he held her, as he was wont alway \rTo caress the noble lady: she was to him as life), \rAgain unto her enemies turned her thoughts his stately wife. \r\r1 401 \rShe spake unto the monarch: "My lord full dear to me, \rNow would I pray a favor, if with thy grace it be, \rThat thou wilt show unto me if merit such be mine \rThat unto my good kinsmen truly doth thy heart incline." \r\r1402 \rThe mighty monarch answered (from guile his heart was free): \r"Of a truth I tell thee, if aught of good may be \rThe fortune of thy kinsmen, \xc3\x91 of that I were full fain, \rFor ne\'er through love of woman might I friends more faithful gain." \r\r1403 \rThereat again spake Kriemhild: "That mayst thou well believe, \rFull high do stand my kinsmen; the more it doth me grieve \rThat they deign so seldom hither to take their way. \rThat here I live a stranger, oft I hear the people say." \r\r1404 \rThen spake the royal Etzel: "Beloved lady mine, \rSeemed not too far the journey, I\'d bid from yond the Rhine \rWhom thou wouldst gladly welcome hither unto my land." \rThereat rejoiced the lady when she his will did understand. \r\r1405 \rSpake she: "Wilt thou true favor show me, master mine, \rThen shalt thou speed thy messengers to Worms across the Rhine. \rWere but my friends acquainted what thing of them I would, \rThen to this land came hither full many a noble knight and good." \r\r1406 \rHe spake: "Whene\'er thou biddest, straight the thing shall be. \rThyself mightst ne\'er thy kinsmen here so gladly see, \rAs I the sons of Ute, high and stately queen. \rIt grieveth me full sorely that strangers here so long they\'ve been. \r\r\r\r2 o8 TWENTY-THIRD ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1407 \r"If this thing doth please thee, beloved lady mine, \rThen gladly send I thither unto those friends of thine \rAs messengers my minstrels to the land of Burgundy." \rHe bade the merry fiddlers lead before him presently. \r\r1408 \rThen hastened they full quickly to where they found the king \rBy side of Kriemhild sitting. He told them straight the thing, \rHow they should be his messengers to Burgundy to fare. \rFull stately raiment bade he for them straightway eke prepare. \r\r1409 \rFour and twenty warriors did they apparel well. \rLikewise did the monarch to them the message tell, \rHow that they King Gunther and his men should bid aright. \rThem eke the Lady Kriemhild to secret parley did invite. \r\r1410 \rThen spake the mighty monarch: "Now well my words attend. \rAll good and friendly greeting unto my friends I send, \rThat they may deign to journey hither to my country. \rFew be the guests beside them that were so welcome unto me. \r\r1411 \r" And if they be so minded to meet my will in aught, \rKriemhild\'s lofty kinsmen, that they forego it not \rTo come upon the summer here where I hold hightide, \rFor that my joy in living doth greatly with my friends abide." \r\r1412 \rThen spake the fiddle-player, Schwemmelein full bold: \r"When thinkst thou in this country such high feast to hold, \rThat unto thy friends yonder tell the same we may?" \rThereto spake King Etzel: "When next hath come midsummer \rday." \r\r1413 \r"We\'ll do as thou commandest," spake then Werbelein. \rUnto her own chamber commanded then the queen \rTo bring in secret manner the messengers alone. \rThereby did naught but sorrow befall full many a thane anon. \r\r\r\rKRIEMHILD\'S THOUGHT OF VENGEANCE 209 \r\r1414 \rShe spake unto the messengers: "Mickle wealth I give to you, \rIf my will in this matter right faithfully ye do, \rAnd bear what tidings send I home unto our country. \rI\'ll make you rich in treasure and fair apparelled shall ye be. \r\r1415 \r"And friends of mine so many as ever see ye may \r\rAt Worms by Rhine river, to them ye ne\'er shall say \r\rThat any mood of sorrow in me ye yet have seen. \r\rSay ye that I commend me unto the knights full brave and keen." \r\r1416 \r" Pray them that to King Etzel\'s message they give heed, \rThereby to relieve me of all my care and need, \rElse shall the Huns imagine that I all friendless am. \rIf I but a knight were, oft would they see me at their home. \r\r1417 \r"Eke say ye unto Gemot, brother to me full dear, \rTo him might never any disposed be more fair; \rPray him that he bring hither unto this country \rAll our friends most steadfast, that we thereby shall honored be. \r\r1418 \r" Say further eke to Giselher that he do have in mind, \rThat by his guilt I never did cause for sorrow find; \rHim therefore would I gladly here with mine own eyes see, \rAnd give him warmest welcome, so faithful hath he been to me. \r\r1419 \r" How I am held in honor, to my mother eke make plain. \rAnd if of Tronje Hagen hath mind there to remain, \rBy whom might they in coming through unknown lands be shown ? \rThe way to Hunland hither from youth to him hath well been \rknown." \r\r1420 \rNo whit knew the messengers wherefore she did advise \rThat they of Tronje Hagen should not in any wise \rLeave by the Rhine to tarry. That was anon their bane: \rThrough him to dire destruction was doomed full many a doughty \rthane. \r\r\r\r2io TWENTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r142 1 \rLetters and kindly greeting now to them they give; \rThey fared from thence rich laden, and merrily might live. \rLeave then they took of Etzel and eke his lady fair, \rAnd parted on their journey dight in apparel rich and rare. \r\r\r\rTWENTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r1bow imerbel anO Scbwemmel brougbt tbe flfceasage \r\r1422 \rWhen to the Rhine King Etzel his messengers had sent, \rWith hasty flight fresh tidings from land to land there went: \rWith messengers full quickly to his high festival \rHe bade them, eke and summoned. To many thereby did \rdeath befall. \r\r1423 \rThe messengers o\'er the borders of Hunland thence did fare \rUnto the land of Burgundy; thither sent they were \rUnto three lordly monarchs and eke their mighty men. \rTo Etzel\'s land to bid them hastily they journeyed then. \r\r1424 \rUnto Bechelaren rode they on their way, \rWhere found they willing service. Nor did aught delay \rRuediger to commend him and Gotelinde as well \rAnd eke their fairest daughter to them that by the Rhine did dwell. \r\r1425 \rThey let them not unladen with gifts from thence depart, \rSo did the men of Etzel fare on with lighter heart. \rTo Ute and to her household sent greeting Ruediger, \rThat never margrave any to them more well disposed were. \r\r1426 \rUnto Brunhild also did they themselves commend \rWith willing service offered and steadfast to the end. \rBearing thus fair greeting the messengers thence did fare, \rAnd prayed the noble margravine that God would have them in his \rcare. \r\r\r\rWERBEL AND SCHWEMMEL 211 \r\r1427 \rEre the messengers had fully passed o\'er Bavarian ground, \rHad the nimble Werbel the goodly bishop found. \rWhat greetings to his kinsmen unto the Rhine he sent, \rThat I cannot tell you; the messengers yet from him went \r\r1428 \rLaden with gold all ruddy, to keep his memory. \rThus spake the Bishop Pilgrim: "\'Twere highest joy to me \rMight I my sister\'s children here see in home of mine, \rFor that I may but seldom go unto them to the Rhine." \r\r1429 \rWhat were the ways they followed as through the lands they fared, \rThat can I nowise tell you. Yet never any dared \rRob them of wealth or raiment, for fear of Etzel\'s hand: \rA lofty king and noble, mighty in sooth was his command. \r\r1430 \rBefore twelve days were over came they unto the Rhine, \rAnd rode into Worms city Werbel and Schwemmelein. \rTold were soon the tidings to the kings and their good men, \rHow that were come strange messengers. Gunther the king did \rquestion then. \r\r143 1 \rAnd spake the monarch further: "Who here may understand \r\rWhence do come these strangers riding unto our land?" \r\rYet was never any might answer to him make, \r\rUntil of Tronje Hagen thus unto King Gunther spake: \r\ri43 2 \r"To us hath come strange tidings to hand this day, I ween, \r\rFor Etzel\'s fiddlers riding hither have I seen. \r\rThe same have by thy sister unto the Rhine been sent: \r\rFor sake of their high master now give we them fair compliment." \r\r1433 \rE\'en then did ride the messengers unto the castle door, \r\rAnd never royal minstrels more stately went before. \r\rBy the monarch\'s servants well received they were: \r\rThey gave them fitting lodging and for their raiment had a care. \r\r\r\r2i2 TWENTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1434 \rRich and wrought full deftly was the travelling-dress they wore, \rWherein they well with honor might go the king before; \rYet they at court no longer would the same garments wear. \rThe messengers inquired if any were might wish them there. \r\r1435 \rIn sooth in such condition many eke were found, \r\rWho would receive them gladly; to such they dealt around. \r\rThen decked themselves the strangers in garments richer far, \r\rSuch as royal messengers beseemeth well at court to wear. \r\r1436 \rBy royal leave came forward to where the monarch sat \rThe men that came from Etzel, and joy there was thereat. \rHagen then to meet them in courteous manner went, \rAnd heartily did greet them, whereat they gave fair compliment. \r\rJ 437 \rTo know what were the tidings, to ask he then began \rHow did find him Etzel and each valiant man. \rThen answer gave the fiddler: "Ne\'er higher stood the land, \rNor the folk so joyous: that shall ye surely understand." \r\r1438 \rThey went unto the monarch. Crowded was the hall. \rThere were received the strangers as of right men shall \rKindly greeting offer in other monarch\'s land. \rMany a valiant warrior saw Werbel by King Gunther stand. \r\r1439 \rRight courteously the monarch began to greet them then: \r"Now be ye both right welcome, Hunland\'s merry men, \rAnd knights that give you escort. Hither sent are ye \rBy Etzel mighty monarch unto the land of Burgundy?" \r\r1440 \rThey bowed before the monarch; then spake Werbelein: \r"My dear lord and master, and Kriemhild, sister thine, \rHither to thy country give fairest compliment. \rIn faith of kindly welcome us unto you they now have sent." \r\r\r\rWERBEL AND SCHWEMMEL 213 \r\r1441 \rThen spake the lofty ruler: "I joy o\'er this ye bring. \rHow liveth royal Etzel," further spake the king, \r"And Kriemhild, my sister, afar in Hunland?" \rThen answered him the fiddler: "That shalt thou straightway \runderstand. \r\r1442 \r"That never any people more lordly life might show \rThan they both do joy in, \xc3\x91 that shalt thou surely know, \xc3\x91 \rWherein do share their kinsmen and all their doughty train. \rWhen from them we parted, of our journey were they fain." \r\r1443 \r"My thanks for these high greetings ye bring at his command \r\rAnd from my royal sister. That high in joy they stand, \r\rThe monarch and his kinsmen, rejoiceth me to hear. \r\rFor, sooth to say, the tidings asked I now in mickle fear." \r\r1444 \rThe twain of youthful princes were eke come thitherward, \rAs soon as they the tidings from afar had heard. \rRight glad were seen the messengers for his dear sister\'s sake \rBy the young Giselher, who in such friendly manner spake: \r\r1445 \r"Right hearty were your welcome from me and brother mine, \r\rWould ye but more frequent ride hither to the Rhine; \r\rHere found ye friends full many whom glad ye were to see, \r\rAnd naught but friendly favors the while that in this land ye be." \r\r1446 \r"To us how high thy favor," spake Schwemmel, " know we well; \rNor with my best endeavor might I ever tell \rHow kindly is the greeting we bear from Etzel\' s hand \rAnd from your noble sister, who doth in highest honor stand. \r\r1447 \r"Your sometime love and duty recalleth Etzel\'s queen, \rAnd how to her devoted in heart we\'ve ever been. \rBut first to royal Gunther do we a message bear, \rAnd pray it be your pleasure unto Etzel\'s land to fare. \r\r\r\r2i 4 TWENTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1448 \r"To beg of you that favor commanded o\'er and o\'er \rEtzel mighty monarch and bids you know the more, \rAn will ye not your sister your faces give to see, \rSo would he know full gladly wherein by him aggrieved ye be, \r\r1449 \r" That ye thus are strangers to him and all his men. \rIf that his spouse so lofty to you had ne\'er been known, \rYet well he thought to merit that him ye\'d deign to see; \rIn sooth could naught rejoice him more than that such thing might \rbe." \r\ri4So \rThen spake the royal Gunther: "A sennight from this day \rShall ye have an answer, whereon decide I may \rWith my friends in counsel. The while shall ye repair \rUnto your place of lodging, and right goodly be your fare." \r\rI45 1 \rThen spake in answer Werbel: "And might such favor be \rThat we the royal mistress should first have leave to see, \rUte, the lofty lady, ere that we seek our rest?" \rTo him the noble Giselher in courteous wise these words addressed : \r\ri45 2 \r"That grace shall none forbid you. Will ye my mother greet, \rTherein do ye most fully her own desire meet. \rFor sake of my good sister fain is she you to see, \rFor sake of Lady Kriemhild ye shall to her full welcome be." \r\rJ 453 \rGiselher then led him unto the lofty dame, \r\rWho fain beheld the messengers from Hunland that came. \r\rShe greeted them full kindly as lofty manner taught, \r\rAnd in right courteous fashion told they to her the tale they brought. \r\r1454 \r"Pledge of loyal friendship sendeth unto thee \rNow my lofty mistress," spake Schwemmel. "Might it be, \rThat she should see thee often, then shalt thou know full well, \rIn all the world there never a greater joy to her befell." \r\r\r\rWERBEL AND SCHWEMMEL 215 \r\r1455 \rReplied the royal lady: "Such thing may never be. \rGladly as would I oft-times my dearest daughter see, \rToo far, alas, is distant the noble monarch\'s wife. \rMay ever yet full happy with King Etzel be her life. \r\r1456 \r"See that ye well advise me, ere that ye hence are gone, \rWhat time shall be your parting; for messengers I none \rHave seen for many seasons as glad as greet I you." \rThe twain gave faithful promise such courtesy full sure to do. \r\r1457 \rForthwith to seek their lodgings the men of Hunland went, \rThe while the mighty monarch for trusted warriors sent, \rOf whom did noble Gunther straightway question make, \rHow thought they of the message. Whereupon full many spake \r\r1458 \rThat he might well with honor to Etzel\'s land be bound, \rThe which did eke advise him the highest \'mongst them found, \rAll save Hagen only, whom sorely grieved such rede. \rUnto the king in secret spake he: "111 shall be thy meed. \r\r1459 \r"What deed we twain compounded art thou full well aware, \r\rWherefor good cause we ever shall have Kriemhild to fear, \r\rFor that her sometime husband I slew by my own hand. \r\rHow dare we ever journey then unto King Etzel\'s land?" \r\r1460 \rReplied the king: "My sister no hate doth harbor more. \rAs we in friendship kissed her, vengeance she forswore \rFor evil that we wrought her, ere that from hence she rode, \xc3\x91 \rUnless this message, Hagen, ill for thee alone forebode." \r\r1461 \r"Now be thou not deceived," spake Hagen, "say what may \rThe messengers from Hunland. If thither be thy way, \rAt Kriemhild\'s hands thou losest honor eke and life, \rFor full long-avenging is the royal Etzel\'s wife." \r\r\r\r216 TWENTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1462 \rAdded then his counsel the princely Gemot there: \r" Though be it thou hast reason thine own death to fear \rAfar in Hunnish kingdom, should we for that forego \rTo visit our high sister, that were in sooth but ill to do." \r\r1463 \rUnto that thane did likewise Giselher then say: \r"Since well thou know\'st, friend Hagen, what guilt on thee doth \r\rweigh, \rThen tarry here behind us and of thyself have care, \rAnd let who dares the journey with us unto my sister fare." \r\r1464 \rThereat did rage full sorely Tronje\'s doughty thane: \r" So shall ye ne\'er find any that were to go more fain, \rNor who may better guide you than I upon your way. \rAnd will ye not give over, know then my humor soon ye may." \r\r1465 \rThen spake the Kitchen Master, Rumold a lofty thane: \r"Here might ye guests and kinsmen in plenty long maintain \rAfter your own pleasure, for ye have goodly store. \rI ween ye ne\'er found Hagen traitor to you heretofore. \r\r1466 \r"If heed ye will not Hagen, still Rumold doth advise \r\xc3\x91For ye have faithful service from me in willing wise \xc3\x91 \rThat here at home ye tarry for the love of me, \rAnd leave the royal Etzel afar with Kriemhild to be. \r\r1467 \r\'Where in the world might ever ye more happy be \rThan here where from danger of every foeman free, \rWhere ye may go as likes you in goodliest attire, \rDrink wine the best, and stately women meet your heart\'s desire. \r\r1468 \r"And daily is your victual the best that ever knew \rA king of any country. And were the thing not true, \rAt home ye yet should tarry for sake of your fair wife \rEre that in childish fashion ye thus at venture set your life. \r\r\r\rWERBEL AND SCHWEMMEL 217 \r\r1469 \r" Thus rede I that ye go not. Mighty are your lands, \rAnd at home more easy may ye be freed from hostile hands \rThan if ye pine in Hunland. How there it is, who knows? \rO Master, go not thither, \xc3\x91 such is the rede that Rumold owes." \r\r1470 \r"We\'ll ne\'er give o\'er the journey," Gemot then did say, \r"When thus our sister bids us in such friendly way \rAnd Etzel, mighty monarch. Wherefore should we refrain? \rWho goes not gladly thither, here at home may he remain." \r\r1471 \rThereto gave answer Hagen: "Take not amiss, I pray, \rThese my words outspoken, let befall what may. \rYet do I counsel truly, as ye your safety prize, \rThat to the Huns ye journey armed full well in warlike guise. \r\r1472 \r" Will ye then not give over, your men together call, \rThe best that ye may gather from districts one and all. \rFrom out them all I\'ll choose you a thousand knights full good, \rThen may ye reck but little the vengeful Kriemhild\'s angry mood." \r\r1473 \r"I\'ll gladly heed thy counsel," straight the king replied, \r\rAnd bade the couriers traverse his kingdom far and wide. \r\rSoon they brought together three thousand men or more, \r\rWho little weened what mickle sorrow was for them in store. \r\r1474 \rJoyful came they riding to King Gunther\'s land. \rSteeds and equipment for them all he did command, \rWho should make the journey thence from Burgundy. \rWarriors many were there to serve the king right willingly. \r\r1475 \rHagen then of Tronje to Dankwart did assign \r\rOf their warriors eighty to lead unto the Rhine. \r\rEquipped in knightly harness were they soon at hand. \r\rRiding in gallant fashion unto royal Gunther\'s land. \r\r\r\r218 TWENTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1476 \rCame eke the doughty Volker, a noble minstrel he, \rWith thirty goodly warriors to join the company, \rWho wore so rich attire \'twould fit a monarch well. \rThat he would fare to Hunland, bade he unto Gunther tell. \r\r1477 \rWho was this same Volker that will I let you know: \rHe was a knight full noble, to him did service owe \rMany a goodly warrior in the land of Burgundy. \rFor that he well could fiddle, named the Minstrel eke was he. \r\r1473 \rThousand men chose Hagen, who well to him were known. \rWhat things in storm of battle their doughty arm had done, \rOr what they wrought at all times, that knew he full well. \rNor of them might e\'er mortal aught but deeds of valor tell. \r\r1479 \rThe messengers of Kriemhild, full loath they were to wait, \rFor of their master\'s anger stood they in terror great. \rEach day for leave to journey more great their yearning grew, \rBut daily to withhold it crafty Hagen pretext knew. \r\r1480 \rHe spake unto his master: "Well shall we beware \rHence to let them journey ere we ourselves prepare \rIn seven days thereafter to ride to Etzel\'s land: \rIf any mean us evil, so may we better understand. \r\r1481 \r" Nor may the Lady Kriemhild ready make thereto, \rThat any by her counsel scathe to us may do. \rYet if such wish she cherish, evil shall be her meed, \rFor many a chosen warrior with us shall we thither lead." \r\r1482 \rShields well-wrought and saddles, with all the mickle gear \rThat into Etzel\'s country the warriors should wear, \rThe same was now made ready for many a knight full keen. \rThe messengers of Kriemhild before King Gunther soon were seen. \r\r\r\rWERBEL AND SCHWEMMEL 219 \r\r1483 \rWhen were come the messengers, Gemot them addressed: \r" King Gunther now is minded to answer Etzel\'s quest. \rFull gladly go we thither with him to make high-tide \rAnd see our lofty sister, \xc3\x91 of that set ye all doubt aside." \r\r1484 \rThereto spake King Gunther: "Can ye surely say \rWhen shall be the high-tide, or upon what day \rWe shall there assemble?" Spake Schwemmel instantly: \r" At turn of sun in summer shall in sooth the meeting be." \r\r1485 \rThe monarch leave did grant them, ere they should take their way, \rIf that to Lady Brunhild they would their homage pay, \rHis high pleasure was it they unto her should go. \rSuch thing prevented Volker, and did his mistress\' pleasure so. \r\ri486 \r\r" In sooth, my Lady Brunhild hath scarce such health to-day \rAs that she might receive you," the gallant knight did say. \r"Bide ye till the morrow, may ye the lady see." \rWhen thus they sought her presence, might their wish not granted \rbe. \r\r1487 \rTo the messengers right gracious was the mighty king, \rAnd bade he from his treasure on shields expansive bring \rShining gold in plenty whereof he had great store. \rEke richest gifts received they from his lofty kinsmen more. \r\r1488 \rGiselher and Gemot, Gere and Ortwein, \rThat they were free in giving soon full well was seen. \rSo costly gifts were offered unto each messenger \rThat they dared not receive them, for Etzel\'s anger did they fear. \r\r1489 \rThen unto King Gunther Werbel spake again: \r" Sire, let now thy presents in thine own land remain. \rThe same we may not carry, my master hath decreed \rThat we accept no bounty. Of that in sooth we\'ve little need." \r\r\r\r22o TWENTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1490 \rThereat the lord of Rhineland was seen in high displeasure, \rThat they should thus accept not so mighty monarch\'s treasure? \rIn their despite yet took they rich dress and gold in store, \rThe which moreover with them home to Etzel\'s land they bore. \r\r1491 \rEre that they thence departed they Lady Ute sought, \rWhereat the gallant Giselher straight the minstrels brought \rUnto his mother\'s presence. Kind greetings sent the dame, \rAnd wish that high in honor still might stand her daughter\'s name. \r\r1492 \rThen bade the lofty lady embroidered silks and gold \rFor the sake of Kriemhild, whom loved she as of old, \rAnd eke for sake of Etzel, unto the minstrels give. \rWhat thus so free was offered might they in sooth right fain receive. \r\r1493 \rSoon now had ta\'en departure the messengers from thence, \rFrom knight and fairest lady, and joyous fared they hence \rUnto Suabian country; Gemot had given behest \rThus far for armed escort, that none their journey might molest. \r\r1494 \rWhen these had parted from them, safe still from harm were they, \rFor Etzel\'s might did guard them wherever led their way. \rNor ever came there any that aught to take would dare, \rAs into Etzel\'s country they in mickle haste did fare. \r\rM95 \rWhere\'er they friends encountered, to all they straight made known \rHow that they of Burgundy should follow after soon \rFrom Rhine upon their journey unto the Huns\' country. \rThe message brought they likewise unto Bishop Pilgrim\'s see. \r\r1496 \rAs down \'fore Bechelaren they passed upon their way, \rThe tidings eke to Ruediger failed they not to say, \rAnd unto Gotelinde, the margrave\'s wife the same. \rAt thought so soon to see them was filled with joy the lofty dame. \r\r\r\rWERBEL AND SCHWEMMEL 221 \r\r1497 \rHasting with the tidings each minstrel\'s courser ran, \rTill found they royal Etzel within his burgh at Gran. \rGreeting upon greeting, which they must all bestow, \rThey to the king delivered; with joy his visage was aglow. \r\r1498 \rWhen that the lofty Kriemhild did eke the tidings hear, \rHow that her royal brothers unto the land would fare, \rIn sooth her heart was gladdened; on the minstrels she bestowed \rRichest gifts in plenty, as she to her high station owed. \r\r1499 \rShe spake: "Now shall ye, Werbel and Schwemmel, tell to me \r"Who cometh of my kinsmen to our festivity, \rWho of all were bidden this our land to seek? \rNow tell me, when the message heard he, what did Hagen speak?" \r\r1500 \rAnswered: "He came to council early upon a day, \rBut little was of pleasant in what he there did say. \rWhen learned he their intention, in wrath did Hagen swear, \rTo death \'twere making journey, to country of the Huns to fare. \r\r1501 \r"Hither ail are coming, thy royal brothers three, \rAnd they right high in spirit. Who more shall with them be, \rThe tale to tell entire were more than I might do. \rTo journey with them plighted Volker the valiant fiddler too." \r\r1502 \r" \'Twere little lost, full truly," answered then the queen, \r"If by my eyes never Volker here were seen. \r\'Tis Hagen hath my favor, a noble knight is he, \rAnd mickle is my pleasure that him full soon we here may see." \r\riS\xc2\xa13 \rHer way the Lady Kriemhild then to the king did take, \r\rAnd in right joyous manner unto her consort spake: \r\r"How liketh thee the tidings, lord full dear to me? \r\rWhat aye my heart hath yearned for, that shall now accomplished \r\rbe." \r\r\r\r222 \r\r\r\rTWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE. \r\r\r\r1504 \r"Thy will my joy was ever," the lofty monarch said. \r"In sooth for my own kinsmen I ne\'er have been so glad, \rTo hear that they come hither unto my country. \rTo know thy friends are coming, hath parted sadness far from me. \r\ri5\xc2\xa15 \rStraight did the royal provosts give everywhere decree \rThat hall and stately palace well prepared should be \rWith seats, that unprovided no worthy guest be left. \rAnon by them the monarch should be of mickle joy bereft. \r\rTWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r1bow tbe fmfgbts all fareo to tbe Ibuns \r\r1506 \rTell we now no further how they here did fare. \rKnights more high in spirit saw ye journey ne\'er \rIn so stately fashion to the land of e\'er a king. \rOf arms and rich attire lacked they never anything. \r\r1507 \rAt Rhine the lordly monarch equipped his warriors well, \rA thousand knights and sixty, as I did hear tell, \rAnd eke nine thousand squires toward the festivity. \rWhom they did leave behind them anon must mourn full gnei \r\rously. \r\r1508 \rAs at Worms across the courtyard equipment full they bore, \rSpake there of Speyer a bishop old and hoar \rUnto Lady Ute: "Our friends have mind to fare \rUnto the festivity; may God their honor have in care." \r\r1509 \rThen spake unto her children Ute the noble dame: \r"At home ye here should tarry, ye knights full high in fame. \rMe dreamt but yester even a case of direst need, \rHow that in this country all the feathered fowl were dead. \r\r\r\rHOW THE KNIGHTS ALL FARED TO THE HUNS 223 \r\r1510 \r"Who recketh aught of dreamings," Hagen then replied, \r"Distraught is sure his counsel when trouble doth betide, \rOr he would of his honor have a perfect care. \rI counsel that my master straight to take his leave prepare. \r\r" Gladly shall we journey into EtzeFs land ; \rThere at their master\'s service may good knights ready stand, \rFor that we there shall witness Kriemhild\'s festivity." \rThat Hagen gave such counsel, rue anon full sore did he. \r\r1512 \rYet in sooth far other than this had been his word, \rHad not with bitter mocking Gemot his anger stirred. \rHe spake to him of Siegfried whom Kriemhild loved so, \rAnd said : "Therefore the journey would Hagen willingly forego." \r\r1513 \rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "Through fear I nothing do. \r\rWhenever will ye, Masters, set straight your hand thereto, \r\rWith you I\'ll gladly journey unto Etzel\'s land." \r\rMany a shield and helmet there hewed anon his mighty hand. \r\ri5 x 4 \rThe ships stood ready waiting, whereunto ample store \rOf clothing for the journey men full many bore, \rNor had they time for resting till shades of even fell. \rAnon in mood full joyous bade they friends at home farewell. \r\rTents full large and many arose upon the green, \rYonder side Rhine river. But yet the winsome queen \rCaressed the doughty monarch that night, and still did pray \rThat far from Etzel\'s country among his kinsmen might he stay. \r\r1516 \rWhen sound of flute and trumpet arose at break of day, \rA signal for their parting, full soon they took their way. \rEach lover to his bosom did friend more fondly press: \rKing Etzel\'s wife full many did part anon in dire distress. \r\r\r\r22 4 TWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\riSi7 \rThe sons of stately Ute, a good knight had they, \rA brave man and a faithful. When they would thence away, \rApart unto the monarch did he his mind reveal, \rAnd spake : " That ye will journey, may I naught but sorrow feel." \r\r1518 \rHight the same was Rumold, a man of doughty hand. \rHe spake: "To whom now leave ye people here and land? \rO that never any might alter your intent! \rSmall good, methinks, may follow message e\'er by Kriemhild sent." \r\r" The land to thee entrusted and eke my child shall be, \rAnd tender care of ladies, \xc3\x91so hast command from me. \rWhene\'er thou seest weeping, do there thy comfort give. \rYea, trust we free from sorrow at hand of Etzel\'s wife to live." \r\r1520 \rFor knight and royal master the chargers ready were, \rAs with fond embracing parted many there, \rWho long m joy together a merry life had led. \rBy winsome dame full many therefor must bitter tear be shed. \r\r1521 \rAs did those doughty warriors into the saddle spring, \rMight full many a lady be seen there sorrowing; \rFor told them well their spirit that thus so long to part \rDid bode a dire peril, the which must ever cloud the heart. \r\r1522 \rAs mounted stood the valiant thanes of Burgundy, \rMight ye a mickle stirring in that country see, \rBoth men and women weeping on either riverside. \rYet pricked they gaily forward, let what might their folk betide. \r\ri5 2 3 \rThe Nibelungen warriors in hauberks bright arrayed \rWent with them, a thousand, while at home behind them stayed \rFull many a winsome lady, whom saw they nevermore. \rThe wounds of doughty Siegfried still grieved the Lady Kriemhild \rsore. \r\r\r\rHOW THE KNIGHTS ALL FARED TO THE HUNS 225 \r\ri5 2 4 \rTheir journey they directed onward to the Main, \rUp through East Frankish country, the men of Gunther\'s train \rThither led by Hagen, who well that country knew; \rMarshal to them was Dankwart, a knight of Burgundy full true. \r\ri5 2 5 \rOn from East Frankish country to Schwanefeld they went, \r\rA train of valiant warriors of high accomplishment, \r\rThe monarchs and their kinsmen, all knights full worthy fame. \r\rUpon the twelfth morning the king unto the Danube came. \r\r1526 \rThe knight of Tronje, Hagen, the very van did lead, \rEver to the Nibelungen a surest help in need. \rFirst the thane full valiant down leapt upon the ground, \rAnd straightway then his charger fast unto a tree he bound. \r\r1527 \rFlooded were the waters and ne\'er a boat was near, \rWhereat began the Nibelungen all in dread to fear \rThey ne\'er might cross the river, so mighty was the flood. \rDismounted on the shore, full many a stately knight then stood. \r\r1528 \r"111 may it," spake then Hagen, "fare here with thee, \rLord of Rhine river. Now thyself mayst see \rHow flooded are the waters, and swift the current flows. \rI ween, before the morrow here many a goodly knight we lose." \r\r1529 \r"How wilt reproach me, Hagen?" the lofty monarch spake. \r"I pray thee yet all comfort not from our hearts to take. \rThe ford shalt thou discover whereby we may pass o\'er, \rHorse and equipment bringing safely unto yonder shore." \r\r1530 \r"In sooth, not I," quoth Hagen, "am yet so weary grown \rOf life, that in these waters wide I long to drown. \rEre that, shall warriors sicken in Etzel\'s far country \rBeneath my own arm stricken: \xc3\x91 \'tis my intent full certainly. \r\r\r\r226 TWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\rI53 1 \r"Here tarry by the water, ye gallant knights and good, \rThe while I seek the boatmen myself along the flood, \rWho will bring us over into Gelfrat\'s land." \rWith that the doughty Hagen took his trusty shield in hand. \r\ri53 2 \rHe cap-a-pie was armed, as thus he strode away, \rUpon his head a helmet that gleamed with brilliant ray, \rAnd o\'er his warlike harness a sword full broad there hung, \rThat on both its edges did fiercely cut, in battle swung. \r\r1533 \rHe sought to find the boatmen if any might be near, \rWhen sound of falling waters full soon upon his ear. \rBeside a rippling fountain, where ran the waters cool, \rA group of wise mermaidens did bathe themselves within the pool. \r\riS34 \rWare of them soon was Hagen and stole in secret near, \rBut fast away they hurried when they the sound did hear. \rThat they at all escaped him, filled they were with glee. \rThe knight did take their clothing, yet wrought none other injury. \r\r1535 \rThen spake the one mermaiden, Hadburg that hight: \r"Hagen, knight full noble, tell will we thee aright, \rAn wilt thou, valiant warrior, our garments but give o\'er, \rWhat fortune may this journey to Hunland have for thee in store." \r\r1536 \rThey hovered there before him like birds above the flood, \rWherefore did think the warrior that tell strange things they could, \rAnd all the more believed he what they did feign to say, \rAs to his eager question in ready manner answered they. \r\r1537 \rSpake one: "Well may ye journey to Etzel\'s country. \r\rThereto my troth I give thee in full security \r\rThat ne\'er in any kingdom might high guests receive \r\rSuch honors as there wait you, \xc3\x91this may ye in sooth believe." \r\r\r\rHOW THE KNIGHTS ALL FARED TO THE HUNS 227 \r\r1538 \rTo hear such speech was Hagen in sooth right glad of heart; \rHe gave to them their garments, and straightway would depart. \rBut when in strange attire they once more were dight, \rTold they of the journey into Etzel\'s land aright. \r\rIS39 \rSpake then the other mermaid, Siegelind that hight: \r"I warn thee, son of Aldrian, Hagen valiant knight, \r\'Twas but to gain her clothing my cousin falsely said, \rFor, comest thou to Hunland, sorely shalt thou be betrayed. \r\r1540 \r"Yea, that thou turnest backward is fitter far, I ween; \rFor but your death to compass have all ye warriors keen \rReceived now the bidding unto Etzel\'s land. \rWhoso doth thither journey, death leadeth surely by the hand." \r\ri54i \rThereto gave answer Hagen: "False speech hath here no gain. \rHow might it ever happen that we all were slain \rAfar in Etzel\'s country through hate of any man?" \rTo tell the tale more fully unto him she then began. \r\r1542 \rSpake again the other: "The thing must surely be, \rThat of you never any his home again shall see, \rSave only the king\'s chaplain; well do we understand \rThat he unscathed returneth unto royal Gunther\'s land." \r\r1543 _ \rThen spake the valiant Hagen again in angry way: \r"Unto my royal masters \'twere little joy to say \rThat we our lives must forfeit all in Hunland. \rNow show us, wisest woman, how pass we safe to yonder strand." \r\r1544 \rShe spake: "Since from thy purposed journey thou wilt not turn, \rWhere upward by the water a cabin stands, there learn \rWithin doth dwell a boatman, nor other find thou mayst." \rNo more did Hagen question, but strode away from there in haste. \r\r\r\r228 TWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\rI 545 \rAs went he angry-minded one from afar did say: \r"Now tarry still, Sir Hagen; why so dost haste away? \rGive ear yet while we tell thee how thou reachest yonder strand. \rMaster here is Else, who doth rule this borderland. \r\r1546 \r"Hight is his brother Gelfrat, and is a thane full rare, \rLord o\'er Bavarian country. Full ill with you \'twill fare, \rWill ye pass his border. Watchful must ye be, \rAnd eke with the ferryman \'twere well to walk right modestly. \r\r1547 \r\' He is so angry-minded that sure thy bane \'twill be, \r\rWilt thou not show the warrior all civility. \r\rWilt thou that he transport thee, give all the boatman\'s due. \r\rHe guardeth well the border and unto Gelfrat is full true. \r\r1548 \r"If he be slow to answer, then call across the flood \rThat thy name is Amelrich. That was a knight full good, \rWho for a feud did sometime go forth from out this land/ \rThe ferryman will answer, when he the name doth understand." \r\rtt I549 \r\rHagen high of spirit before those women bent, \r\rNor aught did say, but silent upon his way he went. \r\rAlong the shore he wandered till higher by the tide \r\rOn yonder side the river a cabin standing he espied. \r\rr 55\xc2\xa1 \rHe straight began a calling across the flood amain. \r^Now fetch me over, boatman," cried the doughty thane. \r"A golden armband ruddy I\'ll give to thee for meed. \rKnow that to make this crossing I in sooth have very need." \r\r1551 \rNot fiittng \'twas high ferryman his service thus should give, \rAnd recompense from any seldom might he receive; \rEke were they that served him full haughty men of mood. \rStill alone stood Hagen on the hither side the flood. \r\r\r\rHOW THE KNIGHTS ALL FARED TO THE HUNS 229 \r\rThen cried he with such power the wave gave back the sound, \r\rFor in strength far-reaching did the knight abound: \r\r"Fetch me now, for Amelrich, Else\'s man, am I, \r\rThat for feud outbroken erstwhile from this land did fly." \r\r1553 \rFull high upon his sword-point an armband did he hold, \r\rFair and shining was it made of ruddy gold, \r\rThe which he offered to him for fare to Gelfrat\'s land. \r\rThe ferryman high-hearted himself did take the oar in hand. \r\r1554 \rTo do with that same boatman was ne\'er a pleasant thing; \rThe yearning after lucre yet evil end doth bring. \rHere where thought he Hagen\'s gold so red to gain, \rMust he by the doughty warrior\'s fierce sword be slain. \r\r1555 \rWith might across the river his oar the boatman plied, \rBut he who there was named might nowhere be espied. \rHis rage was all unbounded when he did Hagen find, \rAnd loud his voice resounded as thus he spake his angry mind: \r\r1556 \r\r"Thou mayst forsooth be called Amelrich by name: \rWhom I here did look for, no whit art thou the same. \rBy father and by mother brother he was to me. \rSince me thou thus hast cozened, so yet this side the river be." \r\r1557 \r"Nay, by highest Heaven," Hagen did declare. \r\r" Here am I a stranger that have good knights in care. \r\rNow take in friendly manner here my offered pay, \r\rAnd guide me o\'er the ferry; my favor hast thou thus alway." \r\r1558 \rWhereat replied the boatman: "The thing may never be. \rThere are that to my masters do bear hostility; \rWherefore I never stranger do lead into this land. \rAs now thy life thou prizest, step straightway out upon the strand." \r\r\r\r230 TWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1559 \r" Deny me not," quoth Hagen, " for sad in sooth my mood. \rTake now for remembrance this my gold so good, \rAnd carry men a thousand and horses to yonder shore." \rQuoth in rage the boatman: " Such thing will happen nevermore." \r\r1560 \rAloft he raised an oar that mickle was and strong, \rAnd dealt such blow on Hagen, (but rued he that\' ere long,) \rThat in the boat did stumble that warrior to his knee. \rIn sooth so savage boatman ne\'er did the knight of Tronje see. \r\r1561 \rWith thought the stranger\'s anger the more to rouse anew, \rHe swung a mighty boat-pole that it in pieces flew \rUpon the crown of Hagen;\xc3\x91 he was a man of might. \rThereby did Else\'s boatman come anon to sorry plight. \r\r1562 \rFull sore enraged was Hagen, as quick his hand he laid \rUpon his sword where hanging he found the trusty blade. \rHis head he struck from off him and flung into the tide. \rKnown was soon the story to the knights of Burgundy beside. \r\r1563 \rWhile the time was passing that he the boatman slew, \rThe waters bore him downward, whereat he anxious grew. \rEre he the boat had righted began his strength to wane, \rSo mightily was pulling royal Gunther\'s doughty thane. \r\r1564 \rSoon he yet had turned it, so rapid was his stroke, \rUntil the mighty oar beneath his vigor broke. \rAs strove he his companions upon the bank to gain, \rNo second oar he found him. Yet soon the same made fast again, \r\rx 5 6 5 \rWith quickly snatched shield-strap, a fine and narrow band. \rDownward where stood a forest he sought again the land, \rAnd there his master found he standing upon the shore. \rIn haste came forth to meet him many a stately warrior more. \r\r\r\rHOW THE KNIGHTS ALL FARED TO THE HUNS 231 \r\r\r\r1566 \rThe gallant knight they greeted with right hearty mood. \rWhen in the boat perceived they reeking still the blood \rThat from the wound had issued where Hagen\'s sword did swing, \rScarce could his companions bring to an end their questioning. \r\r1567 \rWhen that royal Gunther the streaming blood did see \rWithin the boat there running, straightway then spake he: \r"Where is now the ferryman, tell me, Hagen, pray? \rBy thy mighty prowess his life, I ween, is ta\'en away." \r\r1568 \rThereto replied he falsely: "When the boat I found \rWhere slopeth a wild meadow, I the same unbound. \rHereabout no ferryman I to-day have seen, \rNor ever cause of sorrow unto any have I been." \r\r1569 \rThe good knight then of Burgundy, the gallant Gemot, spake: \r" Dear friends full many, fear I, the flood this day will take, \rSince we of the boatmen none ready here may find \rTo guide us o\'er the current. \'Tis mickle sorrow to my mind." \r\ri57o \rFull loudly cried then Hagen. "Lay down upon the grass, \rYe squires, the horse equipments. I ween a time there was, \rMyself was best of boatmen that dwelt the Rhine beside. \rTo Gelfrat\'s country trow I to bring you safely o\'er the tide." \r\ri57i \rThat they might come the sooner across the running flood, \rDrove they in the horses. Their swimming, it was good, \rFor of them never any beneath the waves did sink, \rThough many farther downward must struggle sore to gain the \rbrink. \r\riS72 \rTheir treasure and apparel unto the boat they bore, \rSince by no means the journey thought they to give o\'er. \rHagen was director, and safely reached the strand \rWith many a stalwart warrior bound unto the unknown land. \r\r\r\r2 3 2 TWENTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r1573 \rGallant knights a thousand first he ferried o\'er, \rWhereafter came his own men. Of others still were more, \rFor squires full nine thousand he led unto that land. \rThat day no whit was idle that valiant knight of Tronje\'s hand. \r\r1574 \rWhen he them all in safety o\'er the flood had brought, \rOf that strange story the valiant warrior thought, \rWhich erstwhile had told him those women of the sea. \rLost thereby the chaplain\'s life well-nigh was doomed to be. \r\r1575 \rBeside his priestly baggage he saw the chaplain stand, \rUpon the holy vestments resting with his hand. \rNo whit was that his safety; when Hagen him did see, \rMust the priest full wretched suffer sorest injury. \r\r1576 \rFrom out the boat he flung him ere might the thing be told, \rWhereat they cried together: "Hold, O Master, hold!" \rSoon had the youthful Giselher to rage thereat begun, \rAnd mickle was his sorrow that Hagen yet the thing had done. \r\r1577 \rThen outspake Sir Gemot, knight of Burgundy: \r" What boots it thee, Sir Hagen, that thus the chaplain die ? \rDared any else to do it, thy wrath \'twould sorely stir. \rWherein the priest\'s offending, thus thy malice to incur?" \r\r1578 \rTo swim the chaplain struggled. He thought him yet to free, \rIf any but would help him. Yet such might never be, \rFor that the doughty Hagen full wrathful was of mood. \rHe sunk him to the bottom, whereat aghast each warrior stood. \r\r1579 \rWhen that no help forthcoming the wretched priest might see, \r\rHe sought the hither shore, and fared full grievously. \r\rThough failed his strength in swimming, yet helped him God\'s own \r\rhand, \r\rThat he came securely back again unto the land. \r\r\r\rHOW THE KNIGHTS ALL FARED TO THE HUNS 233 \r\r1580 \rSafe yonder stood the chaplain and shook his dripping dress. \rThereby perceived Hagen how true was none the less \rThe story that did tell him the strange women of the sea. \rThought he: "Of these good warriors soon the days must ended \rbe." \r\r1581 \rWhen that the boat was emptied, and complete their store \rAll the monarch\'s followers had borne upon the shore, \rHagen smote it to pieces and cast it on the flood, \rWhereat in mickle wonder the valiant knights around him stood. \r\r1582 \r"Wherefore dost this, brother," then Sir Dankwart spake; \r"How shall we cross the river when again we make \rOur journey back from Hunland, riding to the Rhine?" \rBehold how Hagen bade him all such purpose to resign. \r\r1583 \rQuoth the knight of Tronje: "This thing is done by me, \rThat if e\'er coward rideth in all our company, \rWho for lack of courage from us away would fly, \rHe beneath these billows yet a shameful death must die." \r\r1584 \rOne there journeyed with them from the land of Burgundy, \rThat was a knight of valor, Volker by name was he. \rHe spake in cunning manner whate\'er might fill his mind, \rAnd aught was done by Hagen did the Fiddler fitting find. \r\r1585 \rReady stood their chargers, the carriers laden well; \rAt passage of the river was there naught to tell \rOf scathe to any happened, save but the king\'s chaplain. \rAfoot must he now journey back unto the Rhine again. \r\r\r\r234 TWENTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\rTWENTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\rDow \xc2\xa9elfrat was Slain bg Danfewart. \r\r1586 \rWhen now they all were gathered upon the farther strand, \rTo wonder gan the monarch: "Who shall through this land \rOn routes aright direct us, that not astray we fare?" \rThen spake the doughty Volker : " Thereof will I alone have care." \r\r1587 \r"Now hark ye all," quoth Hagen, "knight and squire too, \rAnd list to friendly counsel, as fitting is to do. \rFull strange and dark the tidings now ye shall hear from me: \rHome nevermore return we unto the land of Burgundy. \r\r1588 \r"Thus mermaids twain did tell me, who spake to me this morn, \rThat back we come not hither. You would I therefore warn \rThat armed well ye journey and of all ills beware. \rTo meet with doughty foemen well behooveth us prepare. \r\r1589 \r" I weened to turn to falsehood what those wise mermaids spake, \rWho said that safe this journey none again should make \rHome unto our country save the chaplain alone: \rHim therefore was I minded to-day beneath the flood to drown." \r\r1590 \rFrom company to company quickly flew the tale, \rWhereon grew many a doughty warrior\'s visage pale, \rAs gan he think in sorrow how death should snatch away \rAll ere the journey ended; and very need for grief had they. \r\ri59i \rBy Moeringen was it they had the river crossed, \r\rWhere also Else\'s boatman thus his fife had lost. \r\rThere again spake Hagen: "Since in such wise by me \r\rWrath hath been incurred, assailed full surely shall we be. \r\r\r\rHOW GELFRAT WAS SLAIN BY DANKWART 235 \r\rI59 2 \r"Myself that same ferryman did this morning slay. \r\rFar bruited are the tidings. Now arm ye for the fray, \r\rThat if Gelfrat and Else be minded to beset \r\rOur train to-day, they surely with sore discomfiture be met. \r\r1593 \r"So keen they are, well know I the thing they\'ll not forego. \r\rYour horses therefore shall ye make to pace more slow, \r\rThat never man imagine we flee away in fear." \r\r"That counsel will I follow," spake the young knight Giselher. \r\r1594 \r"Who will guide our vanguard through this hostile land?" \r"Volker shall do it," spake they, "well doth he understand \rWhere leadeth path and highway, a minstrel brave and keen." \rEre full the wish was spoken, in armor well equipped was seen \r\r1595 \rStanding the doughty Fiddler. His helmet fast he bound, \r\rAnd from his stately armor shot dazzling light around. \r\rEke to a staff he fastened a banner, red of hue. \r\rAnon with royal masters came he to sorest sorrow too. \r\ri59 6 \rUnto Gelfrat meanwhile had sure tidings flown, \r\rHow that was dead his boatman; the story eke was known \r\rUnto the doughty Else, and both did mourn his fate. \r\rTheir warriors they summoned, nor must long time for answer wait. \r\r1597 \rBut little space it lasted \xc3\x91 that would I have you know \xc3\x91 \r\rEre that to them hasted who oft a mickle woe \r\rHad wrought in stress of battle and injury full sore; \r\rTo Gelfrat now came riding seven hundred knights or more. \r\r1598 \rWhen they their foes to follow so bitterly began, \rLed them both their masters. Yet all too fast they ran \rAfter the valiant strangers vengeance straight to wreak. \rEre long from those same leaders did death full many a warrior \rtake. \r\r\r\r2 3 6 TWENTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1599 \rHagen then of Tronje the thing had ordered there, \r\xc3\x91 How of his friends might ever knight have better care?\xc3\x91 \rThat he did keep the rearguard with warriors many a one, \rAnd Dankwart eke, his brother; full wisely the thing was done. \r\r1600 \rWhen now the day was over and light they had no more, \rInjury to his followers gan he to dread full sore. \rThey shield in hand rode onward through Bavarian land, \rAnd ere they long had waited beset they were by hostile band. \r\r1601 \rOn either side the highway and close upon their rear \rOf hoofs was heard the clatter; too keen the chasers were. \rThen spake the valiant Dankwart: The foe is close at hand. \rNow bind we on the helmet, \xc3\x91wisdom doth the same command." \r\r1602 \rUpon the way they halted, nor else they safe had been. \rThrough the gloom perceived they of gleaming shields the sheen. \rThereupon would Hagen longer not delay: \r\r"Who rideth on the highway?"\xc3\x91 That must Gelfrat tell straight- \rway. \r\r1603 \rOf Bavaria the margrave thereupon replied: \r" Our enemies now seek we, and swift upon them ride. \rFain would I discover who hath my boatman slain. \rA knight he was of valor, whose death doth cause me grievous pain." \r\r1604 \rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "And was the boatman thine \rThat would not take us over? The guilt herein is mine. \rMyself did slay the warrior, and had, in sooth, good need, \rFor that beneath his valor I myself full nigh lay dead. \r\r1605 \r" For pay I rich attire did bid, and gold a store, \rGood knight, that to thy country he should us ferry o\'er. \rThereat he raged full sorely and on me swung a blow \rWith a mighty boat-pole, whereat I eke did angry grow. \r\r\r\rHOW GELFRAT WAS SLAIN BY DANKWART 237 \r\r1606 \r"For my sword then reached I and made his rage to close \rWith a wound all gaping: so thou thy knight didst lose. \rI\'ll give thee satisfaction as to thee seemeth good." \rStraightway began the combat, for high the twain in valor stood. \r\r1607 \r" Well know I," spake Gelfrat, " when Gunther with his train \rRode through this my country that we should suffer bane \rFrom Hagen, knight of Tronje. No more shaU he go free, \rBut for my boatman\'s slaying here a hostage must he be." \r\r1608 \rAgainst their shields then lowered for the charge the spear \rGelfrat and Hagen; eager to close they were. \rElse and Dankwart spurred eke in stately way, \rScanning each the other; then both did valorous arm display. \r\r1609 \rHow might ever heroes show doughty arm so well? \rBackward from off his charger from mighty tilt there fell \rHagen the valiant, by Gelf rat\'s hand borne down. \rIn twain was rent the breast-piece : to Hagen thus a fall was known. \r\r1610 \rWhere met in charge their followers, did crash of shafts resound. \rRisen eke was Hagen, who erst unto the ground \rWas borne by mighty lance-thrust, prone upon the grass. \rI ween that unto Gelfrat nowise of gentle mood he was. \r\r1611 \rWho held their horses\' bridles can I not recount, \rBut soon from out their saddles did they all dismount. \rHagen and Gelfrat straightway did fierce engage, \rAnd all their men around them did eke a furious combat wage. \r\r1612 \rThough with fierce onslaught Hagen upon Gelfrat sprung, \rOn his shield the noble margrave a sword so deftly swung \rThat a piece from off the border \'mid flying sparks it clave. \rWell-nigh beneath its fury fell dead King Gunther\'s warrior brave. \r\r\r\r238 TWENTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1613 \rUnto Dankwart loudly thereat he gan to cry: \r"Help! ho! my good brother! Encountered here have I \rA knight of arm full doughty, from whom I come not free." \rThen spake the valiant Dankwart: " Myself thereof the judge will \rbe." \r\r1614 \rNearer sprang the hero and smote him such a blow \rWith a keen-edged weapon that he in death lay low. \rFor his slain brother Else vengeance thought to take, \rBut soon with all his followers \'mid havoc swift retreat must make. \r\rci \xc2\xa5 l6lS \r\rSlam was now his brother, wound himself did bear, \r\rAnd of his followers eighty eke had fallen there, \r\rBy grim death snatched sudden. Then must the doughty knight, \r\rFrom Gunther\'s men to save him, turn away in hasty flight. \r\r1616 \rWhen that they of Bavaria did from the carnage flee, \rThe blows that followed after resounded frightfully; \rFor close the knights of Tronje upon their enemies chased, \rWho to escape the fury did quit the field in mickle haste. \r\r1617 \rThen spake upon their fleeing Dankwart the doughty thane: \r" Upon our way now let us backward turn again, \rAnd leave them hence to hasten all wet with oozing blood. \rUnto our friends return we, this verily meseemeth good." \r\r1618 \rWhen back they were returned where did the scathe befall, \rOutspake of Tronje Hagen: "Now look ye, warriors all, \rWho of our tale is lacking, or who from us hath been \rHere in battle riven through the doughty Gelfrat\'s spleen." \r\r1619 \r\rLament they must for warriors four from them were ta\'en. \r\rBut paid for were they dearly, for roundabout lay slain \r\rOf their Bavarian foemen a hundred or more. \r\rThe men of Tronje\'s bucklers with blood were wet and tarnished \ro\'er. \r\r\r\rHOW GELFRAT WAS SLAIN BY DANKWART 239 \r\r1620 \rFrom out the clouds of heaven a space the bright moon shone. \rThen again spake Hagen: "Bear report let none \rTo my beloved masters how we here did fare. \rLet them until the morrow still be free from aught of care." \r\r1621 \rWhen they were back returned who bore the battle\'s stress, \rSore troubled was their company from very weariness. \r"How long shall we keep saddle?" was many a warrior\'s quest. \rThen spake the valiant Dankwart : " Not yet may we find place of \rrest, \r\r1622 \r" But on ye all must journey till day come back again." \rVolker, knight of prowess, who led the foremost train, \rBade to ask the marshal: "This night where shall we be, \rThat rest them may our chargers, and eke my royal masters three ?" \r\r1623 \rThereto spake valiant Dankwart: "The same I ne\'er can say, \rYet may we never rest us before the break of day. \rWhere then we find it fitting we\'ll lay us on the grass." \rWhen they did hear his answer, what source of grief to all it was! \r\r1624 \rStill were they unbetrayed by reeking blood and red, \rUntil the sun in heaven its shining beams down shed \rAt morn across the hill-tops, that then the king might see \rHow they had been in battle. Spake he then full angrily: \r\r1625 \r"How may this be, friend Hagen? Scorned ye have, I ween, \r\rThat I should be beside you, where coats of mail have been \rThus wet with blood upon you. Who this thing hath done?" \rQuoth he: "The same did Else, who hath this night us set upon. \r\r1626 \r"To avenge his boatman did they attack our train. \rBy hand of my brother hath Gelfrat been slain. \rThen fled Else before us, and mickle was his need. \rOurs four, and theirs a thousand, remained behind in battle dead." \r\r\r\r2 4 o TWENTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r1627 \rNow can we not inform you where resting-place they found. \rBut cause to know their passing had the country-folk around, \rWhen there the sons of Ute to court did fare in state. \rAt Passau fit reception did presently the knights await. \r\r1628 \rThe noble monarchs\' uncle, Bishop Pilgrim that was, \rFull joyous-hearted was he that through the land did pass \rWith train of lusty warriors his royal nephews three. \rThat willing was his service, waited they not long to see. \r\r1629 \rTo greet them on their journey did friends lack no device, \rYet not to lodge them fully might Passau\'s bounds suffice. \rThey must across the water where spreading sward they found, \rAnd lodge and tent erected soon were stretching o\'er the ground. \r\r1630 \rNor from that spot they onward might journey all that day, \rAnd eke till night was over, for pleasant was their stay. \rNext to the land of Ruediger must they in sooth ride on, \rTo whom full soon the story of their coming eke was known. \r\r1631 \rWhen fitting rest had taken the knights with travel worn, \rAnd of Etzel\'s country they had reached the bourn, \rA knight they found there sleeping that ne\'er should aught but wake, \rFrom whom of Tronje Hagen in stealth a mighty sword did take. \r\r1632 \rHight in sooth was Eckewart that same valiant knight. \rFor what was there befallen was he in sorry plight, \rThat by those heroes\' passing he had lost his sword. \rAt Ruediger\'s marches found they meagre was the guard. \r\r1633 \r"O, woe is me dishonored," Eckewart then cried; \r\r"Yea, rueth me fully sorely, this Burgundian ride. \r\rW T hat time was taken Siegfried, did joy depart from me. \r\rAlack, O Master Ruediger, how ill my service unto thee!" \r\r\r\rHOW GELFRAT WAS SLAIN BY DANKWART 241 \r\r1634 \rHagen, full well perceiving the noble warrior\'s plight, \rGave him again his weapon and armbands six full bright. \r"These take, good knight, in token that thou art still my friend. \rA valiant warrior art thou, though dost thou lone this border tend." \r\r1635 \r"May God thy gifts repay thee," Eckewart replied, \r"Yet rueth me full sorely that to the Huns ye ride. \rErstwhile slew ye Siegfried and vengeance have to fear; \rMy rede to you is truly: "Beware ye well of danger here." \r\r1636 \r"Now must God preserve us," answered Hagen there. \r"In sooth for nothing further have these thanes a care \rThan for place of shelter, the kings and all their band, \rAnd where this night a refuge we may find within this land. \r\r1637 \r"Done to death our horses with the long journey are, \rAnd food as well exhausted," Hagen did declare. \r"Nor find we aught for purchase; a host we need instead, \rWho would in kindness give us, ere this evening, of his bread." \r\r1638 \rThereto gave answer Eckewart: "I\'ll show you such a one, \rThat so warm a welcome find ye never none \rIn country whatsoever as here your lot may be, \rAn if ye, thanes full gallant, the noble Ruediger will see. \r\r1639 \r"He dwelleth by the highway and is most bounteous host \rThat house e\'er had for master. His heart may graces boast, \rAs in the lovely May- time the flowrets deck the mead. \rTo do good thanes a service is for his heart most joyous deed." \r\r1640 \rThen spake the royal Gunther: "Wilt thou my messenger be, \rIf will my dear friend Ruediger, as favor done to me, \rHis hospitable shelter with all my warriors share, \rTherefor full to requite thee shall e\'er hereafter be my care." \r\r\r\r242 J , TWENTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r? ? \' . 1641 \r\r"Thy messenger am I gladly," Eckewart replied, \rAnd in right "willing manner straight away did ride, \rThe message thus received to Ruediger to bear. \rNor did so joyous tidings for many a season greet his ear. \r\r1642 \rHasting to Bechelaren was seen a noble thane. \rThe same perceived Ruediger, and spake: "O\'er yonder plain \rHither hastens Eckewart, who Kriemhild\'s might doth own." \rHe weened that by some foemen to him had injury been done. \r\r1643 \rThen passed he forth the gateway where the messenger did stand. \rHis sword he loosed from girdle and laid from out his hand. \rThe message that he carried might he not long withhold \rFrom the master and his kinsmen; full soon the same to them was \rtold. \r\r1644 \rHe spake unto the margrave: "I come at high command \rOf the lordly Gunther of Burgundian land, \rAnd Giselher and Gemot, his royal brothers twain. \rIn service true commends him unto thee each lofty thane. \r\r1645 \r"The like hath Hagen bidden and Volker as well \r\rWith homage oft-times proffered. And more have I to tell, \r\rThe which King Gunther\'s marshal to thee doth send by me: \r\rHow that the valiant warriors do crave thy hospitality." \r\r1646 \rWith smiling visage Ruediger made thereto reply: \r"Now joyeth me the story that the monarchs high \rDo deign to seek my service, that ne\'er refused shall be. \rCome they unto my castle, \'tis joy and gladness unto me." \r\r1647 \r"Dankwart the marshal hath bidden let thee know \rWho seek with them thy shelter as through thy land they go: \rThree score of valiant leaders and thousand knights right good, \rWith squires eke nine thousand." Thereat was he full glad of mood. \r\r\r\rHOW GELFRAT WAS SLAIN BY DANKWART 243 \r\r1648 \r"To me \'tis mickle honor," Ruediger then spake, \r"That through my castle\'s portals such guests will entry make, \rFor ne\'er hath been occasion my service yet to lend. \rNow ride ye, men and kinsmen, and on these lofty knights attend." \r\r1649 \rThen to horse did hasten knight and willing squire, \rFor glad they were at all times to do their lord\'s desire, \rAnd keen that thus their service should not be rendered late. \rUnwitting Lady Gotelinde still within her chamber sate. \r\r\r\rTWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\rDow tbeg came to JBecbelaren \r\r1650 \rThen went forth the margrave where two ladies sate, \rHis wife beside his daughter, nor longer did he wait \rTo tell the joyful tidings that unto him were brought, \rHow Kriemhild\'s royal brothers his hospitality had sought. \r\r1651 \r"Dearly loved lady," spake then Ruediger, \r"Full kind be thy reception to lordly monarchs here, \rThat now with train of warriors to court do pass this way. \rFair be eke thy greeting to Hagen, Gunther\'s man, this day. \r\r1652 \r"One likewise with them cometh, Dankwart by name, \rVolker bight the other, a knight of gallant fame. \rThyself and eke thy daughter with kiss these six shall greet; \rFull courteous be your manner as ye the doughty thanes shall meet." \r\r1653 \rGave straight their word the ladies, and willing were thereto. \rFrom out great chests they gorgeous attire in plenty drew, \rWhich they to meet the lofty strangers thought to wear. \rMickle was the hurry there of many a lady fair. \r\r\r\r244 TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1654 \rOn ne\'er a cheek might any but nature\'s hue be seen. \rUpon their head they carried band of golden sheen, \rThat was a beauteous chaplet, that so their glossy hair \rBy wind might not be ruffled: that is truth as I declare. \r\r1655 \rAt such employment busy leave we those ladies now. \rHere with mickle hurry across the plain did see \rFriends of noble Ruediger the royal guests to meet, \rAnd them with warmest welcome unto the margrave\'s land did greet. \r\r1656 \rWhen coming forth the margrave saw their forms appear, \rHow spake with heart full joyous the valiant Ruediger! \r"Welcome be ye, Sires, and all your gallant band. \rRight glad am I to see you hither come unto my land." \r\rThen bent the knights before him each full courteously. \rThat he good-will did bear them might they full quickly see. \rHagen had special greeting, who long to him was known; \rTo Volker eke of Burgundy was like highest honor shown. \r\r1658 \rThus Dankwart eke he greeted, when spake the doughty thane: \r"While we thus well are harbored, who then for all the train \rOf those that follow with us shall meet provision make?" \r"Yourselves this night right easy shall rest," the noble margrave \rspake. \r\r1659 \r"And all that follow with you, with equipment whatsoe\'er \rYe bring into my country of steed or warlike gear, \rSo sure shall it be guarded that of all the sum, \rE\'en to one spur\'s value, to you shall never damage come. \r\r1660 \r"Now stretch aloft, my squires, the tents upon the plain. \rWhat here ye have of losses will I make good again. \rUnbridle now the horses and let them wander free." \rUpon their way they seldom did meet like hospitality. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY CAME TO BECHELAREN 245 \r\r1661 \rThereat rejoiced the strangers. When thus it ordered was, \rRode the high knights forward. All round upon the grass \rLay the squires attendant and found a gentle rest. \rI ween, upon their journey was here provision costliest. \r\r1662 \rOut before the castle the noble margravine \rHad passed with her fair daughter. In her train were seen \rA band of lovely women and many a winsome maid, \rWhose arms with bracelets glittered, and all in stately robes \rarrayed. \r\r1663 \rThe costly jewels sparkled with far-piercing ray \rFrom out their richest vestments, and buxom all were they. \rNow came the strangers thither and sprang upon the ground. \rHow high in noble courtesy the men of Burgundy were found! \r\r1664 \rSix and thirty maidens and many a fair lady, \r\xc3\x91 Nor might ye ever any more winsome wish to see \xc3\x91 \rWent then forth to meet them with many a knight full keen. \rAt hands of noble ladies fairest greeting then was seen. \r\r1665 \rThe margrave\'s youthful daughter did kiss the kings all three \rAs eke had done her mother. Hagen stood thereby. \rHer father bade her kiss him; she looked the thane upon, \rWho filled her so with terror, she fain had left the thing undone. \r\r1666 \rWhen she at last must do it, as did command her sire, \rMingled was her color, both pale and hue of fire. \rLikewise kissed she Dankwart and the Fiddler eke anon: \rThat he was knight of valor to him was such high favor shown. \r\r1667 \rThe margrave\'s youthful daughter took then by the hand \rThe royal knight Giselher of Burgundian land. \rE\'en so led forth her mother the gallant Gunther high. \rWith those guests so lofty walked they there full joyfully. \r\r\r\r246 TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1668 \rThe host escorted Gemot to a spacious hall and wide, \rWhere knights and stately ladies sate them side by side. \rThen bade they for the strangers pour good wine plenteously: \rIn sooth might never heroes find fuller hospitality. \r\r1669 \rGlances fond and many saw ye directed there \rUpon Ruediger\'s daughter, for she was passing fair. \rYea, in his thoughts caressed her full many a gallant knight; \rA lady high in spirit, well might she every heart delight. \r\r1670 \rYet whatsoe\'er their wishes, might none fulfilled be. \rHither oft and thither glanced they furtively \rOn maidens and fair ladies, whereof were many there. \rRight kind the noble Fiddler disposed was to Ruediger. \r\r1671 \rThey parted each from other as ancient custom was, \rAnd knights and lofty ladies did separating pass \rWhen tables were made ready within the spacious hall. \rThere in stately manner they waited on the strangers all. \r\r1672 \rTo do the guests high honor likewise the table sought \rWith them the lofty margravine. Her daughter led she not, \rBut left among the maidens, where fitting was she sat. \rThat they might not behold her, grieved were the guests in sooth \rthereat. \r\r1673 \rThe drinking and the feasting, when \'twas ended all, \rEscorted was the maiden again into the hall. \rThen of merry jesting they nothing lacked, I ween, \rWherein was busy Volker, a thane full gallant and keen. \r\r1674 \rThen spake the noble Fiddler to all in lofty tone: \r" Great mercy, lordly margrave, God to thee hath shown, \rFor that he hath granted unto thee a wife \rOf so surpassing beauty, and thereto a joyous life. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY CAME TO BECHELAREN 247 \r\r1675 \r"If that I were of royal birth," the Fiddler spake, \r\r"And kingly crown should carry, to wife I\'d wish to take \r\rThis thy lovely daughter, \xc3\x91 my heart thus prompteth me. \r\rA noble maid and gentle and fair to look upon is she." \r\r1676 \rThen outspake the margrave: "How might such thing be, \rThat king should e\'er desire daughter born to me ? \rExiled from my country here with my spouse I dwell: \rWhat avails the maiden, be she favored ne\'er so well?" \r\r1677 \rThereto gave answer Gemot, a knight of manner kind: \r"If to my desire I ever spouse would find, \rThen would I of such lady right gladly make my choice." \rIn full kindly manner added Hagen eke his voice: \r\r1678 \r" Now shall my master Giselher take to himself a spouse. \rThe noble margrave\'s daughter is of so lofty house, \rThat I and all his warriors would glad her service own, \rIf that she in Burgundy should ever wear a royal crown." \r\r1679 \rGlad thereat full truly was Sir Ruediger, \rAnd eke Gotelinde: they joyed such words to hear. \rAnon arranged the heroes that her as bride did greet \rThe noble knight Giselher, as was for any monarch meet. \r\r1680 \rWhat thing is doomed to happen, who may the same prevent? \rTo come to the assembly they for the maidens sent, \rAnd to the knight they plighted the winsome maid for wife. \rPledge eke by him was given, his love should yet endure with life. \r\r1681 \rThey to the maid allotted castles and spreading land, \rWhereof did give assurance the noble monarch\'s hand \rAnd eke the royal Gemot, \'twould surely so be done. \rThen spake to them the margrave: "Lordly castles have I none, \r\r\r\r2 4 8 TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r1682 \r"Yet true shall be my friendship the while that I may live. \rUnto my daughter shall I of gold and silver give \rWhat hundred sumpter-horses full laden bear away, \rThat her husband\'s lofty kinsmen find honor in the fair array." \r\r1683 \rThey bade the knight and maiden within a ring to stand, \rAs was of old the custom. Of youths a goodly band, \rThat all were merry-hearted, did her there confront, \rAnd thought they on her beauty as mind of youth is ever wont. \r\r1684 \rWhen they began to question then the winsome maid, \rWould she the knight for husband, somewhat she was dismayed, \rAnd yet forego she would not to have him for her own. \rShe blushed to hear the question, as many another maid hath done. \r\r1685 \rHer father Ruediger prompted that Yes her answer be, \rAnd that she take him gladly. Unto her instantly \rSprang the young Sir Giselher, and in his arm so white \rHe clasped her to his bosom. \xc3\x91 Soon doomed to end Was her \rdelight. \r\r1686 \rThen spake again the margrave: "Ye royal knights and high, \rWhen that home ye journey again to Burgundy \rI\'ll give to you my daughter, as fitting is to do, \rThat ye may take her with you." They gave their plighted word \rthereto. \r\r1687 \rWhat jubilation made they yet at last must end. \rThe maiden then was bidden unto her chamber wend, \rAnd guests to seek their couches and rest until the day. \rFor them the host provided a feast in hospitable way. \r\r1688 \rWhen they had feasted fully and to the Huns\' country \rThence would onward journey, "Such thing shall never be," \rSpake the host full noble, "but here ye still shall rest. \rSeldom hath my good fortune welcomed yet so many a guest." \r\r\r\rHOW THEY CAME TO BECHELAREN 249 \r\r1689 \rThereto gave answer Dankwart: "In sooth it may not be. \rBread and wine whence hast thou and food sufficiently, \rOver night to harbor of guests so great a train?" \rWhen the host had heard it, spake he: "All thy words are vain. \r\r1690 \r"Refuse not my petition, ye noble lords and high. \rA fortnight\'s full provision might I in sooth supply, \rFor you and every warrior that journeys in your train. \rTill now hath royal Etzel small portion of my substance ta\'en." \r\r1691 \rThough fain they had declined it, yet they there must stay \rE\'en to the fourth morning. Then did the host display \rSo generous hand and lavish that it was told afar. \rHe gave unto the strangers horses and apparel rare. \r\r1692 \rThe time at last was over and they must journey thence. \rThen did the valiant Ruediger with lavish hand dispense \rUnto all his bounty, refused he unto none \rWhate\'er he might desire. Well-pleased they parted every one. \r\r1693 \rHis courteous retainers to castle gateway brought \rSaddled many horses, and soon the place was sought \rEke by the gallant strangers each bearing shield in hand, \rFor that they thence would journey onward into Etzel\'s land. \r\r1694 \rThe host had freely offered rich presents unto all, \rEre that the noble strangers passed out before the hall. \rHigh in honor lived he, a knight of bounty rare. \rHis fair daughter had he given unto Giselher. \r\r1695 \rEke gave he unto Gunther, a knight of high renown, \rWhat well might wear with honor the monarch as his own, \r\xc3\x91 Though seldom gift received he \xc3\x91 a coat of harness rare. \rThereat inclined King Gunther before the noble Ruediger. \r\r\r\r250 TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r1696 \rThen gave he unto Gemot a good and trusty blade, \rWherewith anon in combat was direst havoc made. \rThat thus the gift was taken rejoiced the margrave\'s wife: \rThereby the noble Ruediger was doomed anon to lose his life. \r\r1697 \rGotelinde proffered Hagen, as \'twas a fitting thing, \rHer gifts in kindly manner. Since scorned them not the king, \rEke he without her bounty to the high festivity \rShould thence not onward journey. Yet loath to take the same \rwas he. \r\r1698 \r"Of all doth meet my vision," Hagen then spake, \r"Would I wish for nothing with me hence to take \rBut alone the shield that hanging on yonder wall I see. \rThe same I\'d gladly carry into Etzel\'s land with me." \r\r1699 \rWhen the stately margravine Hagen\'s words did hear, \rBrought they to mind her sorrow, nor might she stop a tear. \rShe thought again full sadly how her son Nudung fell, \rSlain by hand of Wittich; and did her breast with anguish swell. \r\r1700 \rShe spake unto the hero: "The shield to thee I\'ll give. \rO would to God in heaven that he still did five, \rWhose hand erstwhile did wield it! In battle fell he low, \rAnd I, a wretched mother, must weep with never-ending woe." \r\r1701 \rThereat the noble lady up from the settle rose, \rAnd soon her arms all snow-white did the shield enclose. \rShe bore it unto Hagen, who made obeisance low; \rThe gift she might with honor upon so valiant thane bestow. \r\r1702 \rO\'er it, to keep its color, a shining cover lay \rWith precious stones all studded, nor ever shone the day \rUpon a shield more costly; if e\'er a longing eye \rDid covet to possess it, scarce thousand marks the same might buy. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY CAME TO BECHELAREN 251 \r\r1703 \rThe shield in charge gave Hagen thence away to bear. \rBefore his host then Dankwart himself presented there, \rOn whom the margrave\'s daughter did costly dress bestow. \rWherein anon in Hunland arrayed full stately he did go. \r\r1704 \rWhate\'er of gifts by any was accepted there, \rThem had his hand ne\'er taken, but that intent all were \rTo do their host an honor who gave with hand so free. \rBy his guests in combat soon doomed was he slain to be. \r\ri7\xc2\xa15 \rVolker the valiant to Gotelinde came \rAnd stood in courteous manner with fiddle \'fore the dame. \rSweet melodies he played her and sang his songs thereby, \rFor thought he from Bechelaren to take departure presently. \r\r1706 \rThe margravine bade to her a casket forth to bear. \rAnd now of presents given full freely may ye hear. \rTherefrom she took twelve armbands and drew them o\'er his hand. \r" These shalt thou with thee carry, as ridest thou to Etzel\'s land, \r\r1707 \r" And for my sake shalt wear them when at court thou dost appear, \rThat when thou hither comest I may the story hear \rHow thou hast done me honor at the high festival." \rWhat did wish the lady, faithfully performed he all. \r\r1708 \rThus to his guests the host spake: "That ye more safely fare, \rMyself will give you escort and bid them well beware \rThat upon the highway no ill on you be wrought." \rThereat his sumpter horses straightway laden forth were brought. \r\r1709 \rThe host was well prepared with five hundred men \rWith horse and rich attire. These led he with him then \rIn right joyous humor to the high festival. \rAlive to Bechelaren again came never one of all. \r\r\r\r252 TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1710 \rThence took his leave Sir Ruediger with kiss full lovingly; \rAs fitting was for Giselher, likewise the same did he. \rWith loving arms enfolding caressed they ladies fair. \rTo many a maid the parting did bring anon full bitter tear. \r\r1711 \rOn all sides then the windows were open wide flung, \rAs with his train of warriors the host to saddle sprung. \rI ween their hearts did tell them how they should sorrow deep, \rFor there did many a lady and many a winsome maiden weep. \r\r1712 \rFor dear friends left behind him grieved many a knight full sore, \rWhom they at Bechelaren should behold no more. \rYet rode they off rejoicing down across the sand \rHard by the Danube river on their way to Etzel\'s land. \r\r1713 \rThen spake to the Burgundians the gallant knight and bold, \rRuediger the noble: "Now let us not withhold \rThe story of our coming unto the Hun\'s country. \rUnto the royal Etzel might tidings ne\'er more welcome be." \r\r1714 \rDown in haste through Austria the messenger did ride, \rWho told unto the people soon on every side, \rFrom Worms beyond Rhine river were high guests journeying. \rNor unto Etzel\'s people gladder tidings might ye bring. \r\r1715 \rOnward spurred the messengers who did the message bear, \rHow now in Hunnish country the Nibelungen were. \r"Kriemhild, lofty lady, warm thy welcome be; \rIn stately manner hither come thy loving brothers three." \r\r1716 \rWithin a lofty casement the Lady Kriemhild stood, \rLooking for her kinsmen, as friend for friend full good. \rFrom her father\'s country saw she many a knight; \rEke heard the king the tidings, and laughed thereat for sheer delight. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY CAME TO BECHELAREN 253 \r\r1717 \r\r"Now well my heart rejoiceth," spake Lady Kriemhild. \r"Hither come my kinsmen with many a new -wrought shield \rAnd brightly shining hauberk: who gold would have from me, \rBe mindful of my sorrow; to him I\'ll ever gracious be." \r\r\r\rTWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r1bow tbe JBurgunofans came to JEtsel\'e Castle \r\r1718 \rWhen that the men of Burgundy were come into the land, \rHe of Bern did hear it, the aged Hildebrand. \rHe told it to his master, who sore thereat did grieve; \rThe knight so keen and gallant bade he in fitting way receive. \r\r1719 \rWolfhart the valiant bade lead the heroes forth. \rIn company wi th Dietrich rode many a thane of worth, \rAs out to receive them across the plain he went, \rWhere might ye see erected already many a stately tent. \r\r1720 \rWhen that of Tronje Hagen them far away espied, \rUnto his royal masters full courteously he said: \r"Now shall ye, doughty riders, down from the saddle spring, \rAnd forward go to meet them that here to you a welcome bring. \r\r1721 \r"A train there cometh yonder, well knew I e\'en when young. \rThanes they are full doughty of the land of Amelung. \rHe of Bern doth lead them, and high of heart they are; \rTo scorn their proffered greeting shall ye in sooth full well beware." \r\r1722 \rDismounted then with Dietrich, (as was meet and right,) \rAttended by his squire many a gallant knight. \rThey went unto the strangers and greeted courteously \rThe knights that far had ridden from the land of Burgundy. \r\r\r\r254 TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1723 \rWhen then Sir Dietrich saw them coming near, \rWhat words the thane delivered, now may ye willing hear, \rUnto Ute\'s children. Their journey grieved him sore. \rHe weened that Ruediger knowing had warned what lay for them \rin store. \r\r1724 \r"Welcome be ye, Masters, Gunther and Giselher, \rGemot and Hagen, welcome eke Volker \rAnd the valiant Dankwart. Do ye not understand? \rKriemhild yet sore bemoaneth the hero of Nibelungen land." \r\r1725 \r"Long time may she be weeping," Hagen spake again; \r" In sooth for years a many dead he lies and slain. \rTo the monarch now of Hunland should she devoted be: \rSiegfried returneth never, buried now long time is he." \r\r1726 \r"How Siegfried\'s death was compassed, let now the story be: \rWhile liveth Lady Kriemhild, look ye for injury." \rThus did of Bern Sir Dietrich unto them declare: \r"Hope of the Nibelungen, of her vengeance well beware." \r\r1727 \r"Whereof shall I be fearful?" the lofty monarch spake: \r"Etzel hath sent us message, (why further question make?) \rThat we should journey hither into his country. \rEke hath my sister Kriemhild oft wished us here as guests to see." \r\r1728 \r"I give thee honest counsel," Hagen then did say, \r" Now shalt thou here Sir Dietrich and his warriors pray \rTo tell thee full the story, if aught may be designed, \rAnd let thee know more surely how stands the Lady Kriemhild\'s \rmind." \r\r1729 \rThen went to speak asunder the lordly monarchs three, \rGunther and Gemot, and Dietrich went he. \r" Now tell us true, thou noble knight of Bern and kind, \rIf that perchance thou knowest how stands thy royal mistress\' \rmind." \r\r\r\rTHE BURGUNDIANS AT ETZEL\'S CASTLE 255 \r\r1730 \rThe lord of Bern gave answer: "What need to tell you more? \rI hear each day at morning weeping and wailing sore \rThe wife of royal Etzel, who piteous doth complain \rTo God in heaven that Siegfried her doughty spouse from her was \rta\'en." \r\ri73i \r"Then must we e\'en abide it,." was the fearless word \rOf Volker the Fiddler, "what we here have heard. \rTo court we yet shall journey and make full clear to all, \rIf that to valiant warriors may aught amid the Huns befall." \r\r1732 \rThe gallant thanes of Burgundy unto court then rode, \rAnd went in stately manner as was their country\'s mode. \rFull many a man in Hunland looked eagerly to see \rOf what manner Hagen, Tronje\'s doughty thane, might be. \r\r1733 \rFor that was told the story (and great the wonder grew) \r\rHow that of Netherland Siegfried he slew, \r\rThat was the spouse of Kriemhild, in strength without a peer, \r\rHence a mickle questioning after Hagen might ye hear. \r\r1734 \rGreat was the knight of stature, may ye know full true, \rBuilt with breast expansive; mingled was the hue \rOf his hair with silver; long he was of limb; \rAs he strode stately forward might ye mark his visage grim. \r\r1735 \rThen were the thanes of Burgundy unto quarters shown, \rBut the serving-man of Gunther by themselves alone. \rThus the queen did counsel, so filled she was with hate. \rAnon where they were harbored the train did meet with direst fate. \r\r1736 \rDankwart, Hagen\'s brother, marshal was he. \rTo him the king his followers commended urgently, \rThat he provide them plenty and have of them good care. \rThe noble knight of Burgundy their safety well in mind did bear. \r\r\r\r256 TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r1737 \rBy her train attended, Queen Kriemhild went \r\rTo greet the Nibelungen, yet false was her intent. \r\rShe kissed her brother Giselher and took him by the hand: \r\rThereat of Tronje Hagen did tighter draw his helmet\'s band. \r\r1738 \r"After such like greeting," the doughty Hagen spake, \r"Let all watchful warriors full precaution take: \rDiffers wide the greeting on masters and men bestowed. \rUnhappy was the hour when to this festival we rode." \r\r\r\r!739 \rShe spake: "Now be ye welcome to whom ye welcome be. \r\rFor sake of friendship never ye greeting have from me. \r\rTell me now what bring ye from Worms across the Rhine, \r\rThat ye so greatly welcome should ever be to land of mine?" \r\r1740 \r"An I had only known it," Hagen spake again, \r"That thou didst look for present from hand of every thane, \rI were, methinks, so wealthy \xc3\x91 had I me bethought \xc3\x91 \rThat I unto this country likewise to thee my gift had brought." \r\r1741 \r"Now shall ye eke the story to me more fully say: \rThe Nibelungen treasure, where put ye that away? \rMy own possession was it, as well ye understand. \rThat same ye should have brought me hither unto Etzel\'s land." \r\r1742 \r"In sooth, my Lady Kriemhild, full many a day hath flown \rSince of the Nibelungen hoard I aught have known. \rInto the Rhine to sink it my lords commanded me: \rVerily there must it until the day of judgment be." \r\r1743 \rThereto the queen gave answer: "Such was e\'en my thought. \r\rThereof right little have ye unto me hither brought, \r\rAlthough myself did own it and once o\'er it held sway. \r\r\'Tis cause that I for ever have full many a mournful day." \r\r\r\rTHE BURGUNDIANS AT ETZEL\'S CASTLE 257 \r\r1744 \r"The devil have I brought thee," Hagen did declare. \r"My shield it is so heavy that I have to bear, \rAnd my plaited armor; my shining helmet see, \rAnd sword in hand I carry, \xc3\x91 so might I nothing bring for thee." \r\r1745 \rThen spake the royal lady unto the warriors all: \r\r"Weapon shall not any bear into the hall. \rTo me now for safe keeping, ye thanes shall give them o\'er." \r"In sooth," gave answer Hagen, "such thing shall happen never- \rmore. \r\r1746 \r"Such honor ne\'er I covet, royal lady mild, \rThat to its place of keeping thou shouldst bear my shield \rWith all my other armor, \xc3\x91 for thou art a queen. \rSuch taught me ne\'er my sire: myself will be my chamberlain." \r\r1747 \r"Alack of these my sorrows!" the Lady Kriemhild cried; \r\r"Wherefore will now my brother and Hagen not confide \r\rTo me their shields for keeping? Some one did warning give. \r\rKnew I by whom \'twas given, brief were the space that he might \r\rlive." \r\r1748 \r\rThereto the mighty Dietrich in wrath his answer gave: \r\r"\'Tis I who now these noble lords forewarned have, \r\rAnd Hagen, knight full valiant of the land of Burgundy. \r\rNow on! thou devil\'s mistress, let not the deed my profit be." \r\r1749 \rGreat shame thereat did Kriemhild\'s bosom quickly fill; \r\rShe feared lest Dietrich\'s anger should work her grievous ill. \r\rNaught she spake unto them as thence she swiftly passed, \r\rBut fierce the lightning glances that on her enemies she cast. \r\ri75o \rBy hand then grasped each other doughty warriors twain: \r\rHight the one was Dietrich, with Hagen, noble thane. \r\rThen spake in courteous manner that knight of high degree: \r\r"That ye are come to Hunland, \'tis very sorrow unto me s \r\r\r\r258 TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\rI75 1 \r"For what hath here been spoken by the lofty queen." \rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "Small cause to grieve, I ween." \rHeld converse thus together those brave warriors twain, \rKing Etzel which perceiving thus a questioning began: \r\r1752 \r"I would learn full gladly," \xc3\x91 in such wise spake he \xc3\x91 \r"Who were yonder warrior, to whom so cordially \rDoth greeting give Sir Dietrich. Meseemeth high his mood. \rWhosoe\'er his sire, a thane he is of mettle good." \r\r\r\r1753 \rUnto the king gave answer of Kriemhild\'s train a knight: \r\r" Born he was of Tronje, Aldrian his sire hight. \r\rHow merry here his bearing, a thane full grim is he. \r\rThat I have spoken truly, shalt thou anon have cause to see.\'L \r\r1754 \r"How may I then perceive it that fierce his wrath doth glow?" \rNaught of basest treachery yet the king did know, \rThat anon Queen Kriemhild \'gainst her kinsmen did contrive, \rWhereby returned from Hunland not one of ail their train alive. \r\r1755 \r"Well knew I Aldrian, he once to me was thane: \rPraise and mickle honor he here by me did gain. \rMyself a knight did make him, and gave him of my gold. \rHelke, noble lady, did him in highest favor hold. \r\r1756 \r"Thereby know I fully what Hagen since befell. \rTwo stately youths as hostage at my court did dwell, \rHe and Spanish Walter, from youth to manhood led. \rHagen sent I homeward; Walter with Hildegunde fled." \r\r1757 \rHe thought on ancient story that long ago befell. \rHis doughty friend of Tronje knew he then right well, \rWhose youthful valor erstwhile did such assistance lend. \rThrough him in age he must be bereft of many a dearest friend. \r\r\r\rHOW HE AROSE NOT BEFORE HER 259 \r\rTWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE \rDow "foe arose not before 1ber \r\r1758 \rThen parted from each other the noble warriors twain, \rHagen of Tronje and Dietrich, lofty thane. \rThen did King Gunther\'s warrior cast a glance around, \rSeeking a companion the same he eke full quickly found. \r\r1759 \rAs standing there by Giselher he did Volker see, \r\rHe prayed the nimble Fiddler to bear him company, \r\rFor that full well he knew it how grim he was of mood, \r\rAnd that in all things was he a knight of mettle keen and good. \r\r1760 \rWhile yet their lords were standing there in castle yard \rSaw ye the two knights only walking thitherward \rAcross the court far distant before the palace wide. \rThe chosen thanes recked little what might through any\'s hate \rbetide. \r\r1761 \rThey sate them down on settle over against a hall, \rWherein dwelt Lady Kriemhild, beside the palace wall. \rFull stately their attire on stalwart bodies shone. \rAll that did look upon them right gladly had the warriors known. \r\r1762 \rLike unto beasts full savage were they gaped upon, \rThe two haughty heroes, by full many a Hun. \rEke from a casement Etzel\'s wife did them perceive: \rOnce more to behold them must fair Lady Kriemhild grieve. \r\r1763 \rIt called to mind her sorrow, and she to weep began, \rWhereat did mickle wonder many an Etzel\'s man, \rWhat grief had thus so sudden made her sad of mood. \rSpake she: " That hath Hagen, ye knights of mettle keen and good." \r\r\r\r260 TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1764 \rThey to their mistress answered: "Such thing, how hath it been? \rFor that thee right joyous we but now have seen. \rNe\'er lived he so daring that, having wrought thee ill, \rHis life he must not forfeit, if but to vengeance point thy will." \r\r1765 \r"I live but to requite him that shall avenge my wrong; \r\rWhate\'er be his desire shall unto him belong. \r\rProstrate I beseech you," \xc3\x91so spake the monarch\'s wife\xc3\x91 \r\r"Avenge me upon Hagen, and forfeit surely be his life." \r\r1766 \rThree score of valiant warriors made ready then straightway \rTo work the will of Kriemhild and her hest obey \rBy slaying of Sir Hagen, the full valiant thane, \' \rAnd eke the doughty Fiddler ; by shameful deed thus sought they \rgain. \r\r1767 \rWhen the queen beheld there so small their company, \rIn full angry humor to the warriors spake she : \r"What there ye think to compass, forego such purpose yet: \rSo small in numbers never dare ye Hagen to beset. \r\r1768 \r" How doughty e\'er be Hagen, and known his valor wide, \rA man by far more doughty that sitteth him beside, \rVolker the Fiddler: a warrior grim is he. \rIn sooth may not so lightly the heroes twain confronted be." \r\r1769 \rWhen that she thus had spoken, ready soon were seen \rFour hundred stalwart warriors; for was the lofty queen \rFull intent upon it to work them evil sore. \rTherefrom for all the strangers was mickle sorrow yet in store. \r\r1770 \rWhen that complete attire\'d were her^ retainers seen, \rUnto the knights impatient in such wise spake the queen: \r"Now bide ye yet a moment and stand ye ready so, \rWhile I with crown upon me unto my enemies shall go. \r\r\r\rHOW HE AROSE NOT BEFORE HER 261 \r\r1771 \r"And list while I accuse him how he hath wrought me bane, \rHagen of Tronje, Gunther\'s doughty thane. \rI know his mood so haughty, naught he\'ll deny of all. \rNor reck I what of evil therefrom may unto him befall." \r\r1772 \rThen saw the doughty Fiddler \xc3\x91 he was a minstrel keen\xc3\x91 \rAdown the steps descending the high and stately queen \rWho issued from the castle. When he the queen espied, \rSpake the valiant Volker to him was seated by his side: \r\r1773 \r" Look yonder now, friend Hagen, how that she hither hies \r\rWho to this land hath called us in such treacherous wise. \r\rNo monarch\'s wife I ever saw followed by such band \r\rOf warriors armed for battle, that carry each a sword in hand. \r\r1774 \r"Know\'st thou, perchance, friend Hagen, if hate to thee they bear? \rThen would I well advise thee of them full well beware \rAnd guard both life and honor. That methinks were good, \rFor if I much mistake not, full wrathful is the warriors\' mood. \r\r1775 \r" Of many eke among them so broad the breasts do swell, \rThat who would guard him \'gainst them betimes would do it well. \rI ween that \'neath their tunics they shining mail-coats wear: \rYet might I never tell thee, \'gainst whom such evil mind they bear." \r\r1776 \rThen spake all wrathful-minded Hagen the warrior keen: \r"On me to vent their fury is their sole thought, I ween, \rThat thus with brandished weapons their onward press we see. \rDespite them all yet trow I to come safe home to Burgundy. \r\r\r\r1777 \r"Now tell me, friend Volker, wilt thou beside me steyid, \rIf seek to work me evil here Kriemhild\'s band? \rThat let me hear right truly, as I am dear to thee. \rBy thy side forever shall my service faithful be. \r\r\r\re stand, \r\r\r\r262 TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1778 \r"Full surely will I help thee," the minstrel straight replied; \r"And saw I e\'en a monarch with all his men beside \rHither come against us, the while a sword I wield \rNot fear shall ever prompt me from thy side one pace to yield." \r\r1779 \r"Now God in heaven, O Volker, give thy high heart its meed. \rWill they forsooth assail me, whereof else have I need? \rWilt thou thus stand beside me as here is thy intent, \rLet come all armed these warriors, on whatsoever purpose bent." \r\r1780 \r"Now rise we from this settle," the minstrel spake once more, \r"While that the royal lady passeth here before. \rTo her be done this honor as unto lady high. \rOurselves in equal manner shall we honor eke thereby." \r\r1781 \r"Nay, nay! as me thou lovest," Hagen spake again, \r"For so would sure imagine here each hostile thane \rThat \'twere from fear I did it, should I bear me so. \rFor sake of never any will I from this settle go. \r\r1782 \r"Undone we both might leave it in sooth more fittingly. \rWherefore should I honor who bears ill-will to me? \rSuch thing will I do never, the while I yet have life. \rNor reck I aught how hateth me the royal Etzel\'s wife." \r\r1783 \rThereat defiant Hagen across his knee did lay \rA sword that shone full brightly, from whose knob did play \rThe fight of glancing jasper greener than blade of grass. \rWell perceived Kriemhild that it erstwhile Siegfried\'s was. \r\r1784 \rWhen she tk^sword espie\'d, to weep was sore her need. \rThe hilt jM ilining golden, the sheath a band of red. \rAs it recf^Hpfer sorrow, her tears had soon begun; \rI ween for thTat same purpose \'twas thus by dauntless Hagen done. \r\r\r\rHOW HE AROSE NOT BEFORE HER 263 \r\r1785 \rEke the valiant Volker a fiddle-bow full strong \r\rUnto himself drew nearer; mickle it was and long, \r\rLike unto a broad-sword full sharp that was and wide. \r\rSo sat they all undaunted the stately warriors side by side. \r\r1786 \rThere sat the thanes together in such defiant wise \rThat would never either from the settle rise \rThrough fear of whomsoever. Then strode before their feet \rThe lofty queen, and wrathful did thus the doughty warriors greet. \r\r1787 \rQuoth she: "Now tell me, Hagen, upon whose command \rDarest thou thus to journey hither to this land, \rAnd knowest well what sorrow through thee my heart must bear. \rWert thou not reft of reason, then hadst thou kept thee far from \rhere." \r\r1788 \r"By none have I been summoned," Hagen gave reply. \r"Three lofty thanes invited were to this country: \rThe same I own as masters and service with them find. \rWhene\'er they make court journey \'twere strange should I remain \rbehind." \r\r1789 \rQuoth she: "Now tell me further, wherefore didst thou that \rWhereby thou hast deserved my everlasting hate? \r\'Twas thou that slewest Siegfried, spouse so dear to me, \rThe which, till life hath ended, must ever cause for weeping be." \r\r1790 \rSpake he: "Why parley further, since further word were vain? \rE\'en I am that same Hagen by whom was Siegfried slain, \rThat deft knight of valor. How sore by him \'twas paid \rThat the Lady Kriemhild dared the fair Brunhild upbraid! \r\r1791 \r" Beyond all cavil is it, high and royal dame, \rOf all the grievous havoc I do bear the blame. \rAvenge it now who wisheth, woman or man tho\'t be.\' \rAn I unto thee he not, I\'ve wrought thee sorest injury." \r\r\r\r264 TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r1792 \rShe spake: "Now hear, ye warriors, how denies he not at all \rThe cause of all my sorrow. Whate\'er may him befall \rReck I not soever, that know ye, Etzel\'s men." \rThe overweening warriors blank gazed upon each other then. \r\rJ 793 \rHad any dared the onset, seen it were full plain \r\rThe palm must be awarded to the companions twain, \r\rWho had in storm of battle full oft their prowess shown. \r\rWhat that proud band designed through fear must now be left un. \r\rdone. \r\r1794 \rOutspake one of their number: "Wherefore look thus to me? \rWhat now I thought to venture left undone shall be, \rNor for reward of any think I my life to lose; \rTo our destruction lures us here the royal Etzel\'s spouse." \r\r1795 \rThen spake thereby another: "Like mind therein have I. \r\rThough ruddy gold were offered like towers piled high, \r\rYet would I never venture to stir this Fiddler\'s spleen. \r\rSuch are the rapid glances that darting from his eyes I\'ve seen. \r\r1796 \r"Likewise know I Ha gen from youthful days full well, \rNor more about his valor to me need any tell. \rIn two and twenty battles I the knight have seen, \rWTiereby sorest sorrow to many a lady\'s heart hath been. \r\r1797 \r" When here they were with Etzel, he and the knight of Spain \rBore storm of many a battle in many a warlike train \rFor sake of royal honor, so oft thereof was need. \rWherefore of right are honors high the valiant Hagen\'s meed. \r\r1798 \r"Then was yet the hero but a child in years; \rNow how hoary-headed who were his youthful feres i \rTo wisdor|Aow attained, a warrior grim and strong, \rEke bears^e with him Balmung, the which he gained by mickle \rwrong." \r\r\r\rHOW HE AROSE NOT BEFORE HER 265 \r\r1799 \rTherewith the matter ended, and none the fight dared start, \rWhereat the Lady Kriemhild full heavy was of heart. \rHer warriors thence did vanish, for feared they death indeed \rAt hands of the Fiddler, whereof right surely was there need. \r\r1800 \rOutspake then the Fiddler: "Well we now have seen, \rThat enemies here do greet us, as we forewarned have been. \rBack unto the monarchs let us straight repair, \rThat none against our masters to raise a hostile hand may dare. \r\r1801 \r" How oft from impious purpose doth fear hold back the hand, \rWhere friend by friend doth only firm in friendship stand, \rUntil right sense give warning to leave the thing undone. \rThus wisdom hath prevented the harm of mortals many a one." \r\r1802 \r"Heed I will thy counsel," Hagen gave reply. \rThen passed they where the monarchs found they presently \rIn high state received within the palace court. \rLoud the valiant Volker straight began after this sort \r\r1803 \rUnto his royal masters: "How long will ye stand so, \rThat foes may press upon you ? To the king ye now shall go, \rAnd from his lips hear spoken how is his mind to you." \rThe valiant lords and noble consorted then by two and two. \r\r1804 \rOf Bern the lofty Dietrich took by the hand \rGunther the lordly monarch of Burgundian land; \rIrnfried escorted Gemot, a knight of valor keen, \rAnd Ruediger with Giselher going unto the court was seen. \r\r1805 \rHowe\'er with fere consorted there any thane might be, \rVolker and Hagen ne\'er parted company, a \r\rSave in storm of battle when they did reach life\'s bourne. \r\'Twas cause that highborn ladies anon in grievous way must mourn. \r\r\r\r266 TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r1806 \rUnto the court then passing with the kings were seen, \rOf their lofty retinue a thousand warriors keen, \rAnd threescore thanes full valiant that followed in their train; \rThe same from his own country had doughty Hagen with him ta\'en. \r\r1807 \rHawart and eke Iring, chosen warriors twain, \rSaw ye walk together in the royal train. \rBy Dankwart and Wolfhart, a thane of high renown, \rWas high courtly bearing there before the others shown. \r\r1808 \rWhen the lord of Rhineland passed into the hall, \rEtzel mighty monarch waited not at all, \rBut sprang from off his settle when he beheld him nigh. \rBy monarch ne\'er was given greeting so right heartily. \r\r1809 \r"Welcome be, Lord Gunther, and eke Sir Gemot too, \rAnd your brother Giselher. My greetings unto you \rI sent with honest purpose to Worms across the Rhine; \rAnd welcome all your followers shall be unto this land of mine. \r\r1810 \r"Right welcome be ye likewise, doughty warriors twain, \rVolker the full valiant, and Hagen dauntless thane, \rTo me and to my lady here in my country. \rUnto the Rhine to greet you many a messenger sent she." \r\r1811 \rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: " Thereof I\'m well aware, \rAnd did I with my masters not thus to Hunland fare, \rTo do thee honor had I ridden unto thy land." \rThen took the lofty monarch the honored strangers by the hand. \r\r1812 \rHe led them to the settle whereon himself he sat, \rThen poured they for the strangers \xc3\x91 with care they tended that \xc3\x91 \rIn goblets wide and golden mead and mulberry wine, \rAnd bade right hearty welcome unto the knights afar from Rhine. \r\r\r\rHOW HE AROSE NOT BEFORE HER 267 \r\r1813 \rThen spake the monarch Etzel: "This will I freely say: \rNaught in this world might happen to bring my heart more joy, \rThan that ye lofty heroes thus are come to me. \rThe queen from mickle sadness thereby make ye likewise free. \r\r1814 \r" To me \'twas mickle wonder wherein had I transgressed, \rThat I for friends had won me so many a noble guest, \rYet ye had never deigned to come to my country. \r\'Tis now turned cause of gladness that you as guests I here may see." \r\r1815 \rThereto gave answer Ruediger, a knight of lofty mind: \r"Well mayst thou joy to see them; right honor shalt thou find \rAnd naught but noble bearing in my high mistress\' kin. \rWith them for guest thou likewise many a stately thane dost win." \r\r1816 \rAt turn of sun in summer were the knights arrived \rAt mighty Etzel\'s palace. Ne\'er hath monarch lived \rThat lordly guests did welcome with higher compliment. \rWhen come was time of eating, the king with them to table went. \r\r1817 \rAmid his guests more stately a host was seated ne\'er. \rThey had in fullest measure of drink and goodly fare; \rWhate\'er they might desire, they ready found the same. \rTales of mickle wonder had spread abroad the heroes\' fame. \r\rTHIRTIETH ADVENTURE \r\rf>ow tbeg kept <3uar& \r\r1818 \rAnd now the day was ended and nearing was the night. \rCame then the thought with longing unto each way-worn knight, \rWTien that they might rest them and to their beds be shown. \r\'Twas mooted first by Hagen and straight was answer then made \rknown. \r\r\r\r268 THIRTIETH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1819 \rTo Etzel spake then Gunther: "Fair days may God thee give\' \rTo bed we\'ll now betake us, an be it by thy leave; \rWe\'ll come betimes at morning, if so thy pleasure be." \rFrom his guests the monarch parted then full courteously. \r\r1820 \rUpon the guests on all sides the Huns yet rudely pressed, \rWhereat the valiant Volker these words to them addressed: \r"How dare ye \'fore these warriors thus beset the way? \rIf that ye desist not, rue such rashness soon ye may. \r\r1821 \r"Let fall will I on some one such stroke of fiddle-bow, \rThat eyes shall fill with weeping if he hath friend to show. \rWhy make not way before us, as fitting were to do! \rKnights by name ye all are, but knighthood\'s ways unknown to \ryou." \r\r1822 \rWhen outspake the Fiddler thus so wrathfully \rBackward glanced bold Hagen to see what this might be. \rQuoth he: "He redes you rightly, this keen minstrel knight. \rYe followers of Kriemhild, now pass to rest you for the night. \r\r1823 \r"The thing whereof ye\'re minded will none dare do, I ween. \r\rIf aught ye purpose \'gainst us, on the morrow be that seen, \r\rAnd let us weary strangers the night in quiet pass; \r\rI ween, with knights of honor such evermore the custom was." \r\r1824 \rThen were led the strangers into a spacious hall \rWhere they found prepared for the warriors one and all \rBeds adorned full richly, that were both wide and long. \rYet planned the Lady Kriemhild to work on them the direst wrong. \r\r1825 \rRich quilted mattress covers of Arras saw ye there \rLustrous all and silken, and spreading sheets there were \rWrought of silk of Araby, the best might e\'er be seen. \rO\'er them lay rich embroidered stuffs that cast a brilliant sheen \r\r\r\rHOW THEY KEPT GUARD 269 \r\r1826 \rCoverlets of ermine full many might ye see, \rWith sullen sable mingled, whereunder peacefully \rThey should rest the night through till came the shining day. \rA king with all retinue ne\'er, I ween, so stately lay. \r\r1827 \r"Alack for these night-quarters!" quoth young Giselher, \r"Alack for my companions who this our journey share! \rHow kind so e\'er my sister\'s hospitality, \rDead by her devising, I fear me, are we doomed to be." \r\r1828 \r"Let now no fears disturb you," Hagen gave reply; \r"Through the hours of sleeping keep the watch will I. \rI trust full well to guard you until return the day, \rThereof be never fearful; let then preserve him well who may." \r\r1829 \rInclined they all before him thereat to give him grace. \rThen sought they straight their couches; in sooth \'twas little space \rUntil was softly resting every stately man. \rBut Hagen, valiant hero, the while to don his armor gan. \r\r1830 \rSpake then to him the Fiddler, Volker a doughty thane: \r"I\'ll be thy fellow, Hagen, an wilt thou not disdain, \rWhile watch this night thou keepest, until do come the morn." \rRight heartily the hero to Volker then did thanks return. \r\r183-1 \r\r"God in heaven requite thee, Volker, trusty fere. \rIn all my time of trouble wished I none other near, \rNone other but thee only, when dangers round me throng. \rI\'ll well repay that favor, if death withhold its hand so long." \r\r1832 \rArrayed in glittering armor both soon did ready stand; \rEach did take unto him a mighty shield in hand, \rAnd passed without the portal there to keep the way. \rThus were the strangers guarded, and trusty watchers eke had they. \r\r\r\r270 THIRTIETH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1833 \rVolker the valiant, as he sat before the hall, \r\rLeaned his trusty buckler meanwhile against the wall, \r\rThen took in hand his fiddle as he was wont to do: \r\rAll times the thane would render unto his friends a service true. \r\r1834 \rBeneath the hall\'s wide portal he sat on bench of stone; \rThan he a bolder fiddler was there never none. \rAs from his chords sweet echoes resounded through the hall, \rThanks for glad refreshment had Volker from the warriors all. \r\r1835 \rThen from the strings an echo the wide hall did fill, \r\rFor in his fiddle-playing the knight had strength and skill. \r\rSofter then and sweeter to fiddle he began \r\rAnd wiled to peaceful slumber many an anxious brooding man. \r\r1836 \r\rWhen they were wrapped in slumber and he did understand, \r\rThen took again the warrior his trusty shield in hand \r\rAnd passed without the portal to guard the entrance tower, \r\rAnd safe to keep his fellows where Kriemhild\'s crafty men did \r\rlower. \r\r1837 \rAbout the hour of midnight, or earlier perchance, \rThe eye of valiant Volker did catch a helmet\'s glance \rAfar from out the darkness: the men of Kriemhild sought \rHow that upon the strangers might grievous scathe in stealth be \rwrought. \r\r1838 \rQuoth thereat the Fiddler: "Friend Hagen, \'tis full clear \rThat we do well together here this watch to share. \rI see before us yonder men armed for the fight; \rI ween they will attack us, if I their purpose judge aright." \r\r1839 \r"Be silent, then," spake Hagen, "and let them come more nigh. \rEre that they perceive us shall helmets sit awry, \rBy good swords disjointed that in our hands do swing. \rTale of vigorous greeting shall they back to Kriemhild bring." \r\r\r\rHOW THEY KEPT GUARD 271 \r\r1840 \rAmid the Hunnish warriors one full soon did see, \rThat well the door was guarded; straightway then cried he: \r"The thing we here did purpose \'tis need we now give o\'er, \rFor I behold the Fiddler standing guard before the door. \r\r1841 \r"Upon his head a helmet of glancing light is seen, \rWelded strong and skilful, dintless, of clearest sheen. \rThe mail-rings of his armor do sparkle like the fire, \rBeside him stands eke Hagen; safe are the strangers from our ire." \r\r1842 \rStraightway they back returned. When Volker that did see, \rUnto his companion wrathfully spake he: \r"Now let me to those caitiffs across the court-yard go; \rWhat mean they by such business, from Kriemhild\'s men I fain \rwould know." \r\r1843 \r"No, as thou dost love me," Hagen straight replied; \r"If from this hall thou partest, such ill may thee betide \rAt hands of these bold warriors and from the swords they bear, \rThat I must haste to help thee, though here our kinsmen\'s bane it \rwere. \r\r1844 \r"Soon as we two together have joined with them in fight, \rA pair or two among them will surely hasten straight \rHither to this hall here, and work such havoc sore \rUpon our sleeping brethren, as must be mourned evermore." \r\r1845 \rThereto gave answer Volker: "So much natheless must be, \rThat they do learn full certain how I the knaves did see, \rThat the men of Kriemhild hereafter not deny \rWhat they had wrought full gladly here with foulest treachery." \r\r1846 \rStraightway then unto them aloud did Volker call: \r"How go ye thus in armor, ye valiant warriors all? \rOr forth, perchance, a-robbing, Kriemhild\'s men, go ye? \rMyself and my companion shall ye then have for company." \r\r\r\r272 THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE \r\r1847 \rThereto no man gave answer. Wrathful grew his mood: \r"Fie, ye caitiff villains," spake the hero good, \r"Would ye us so foully have murdered while we slept? \rWith knights so high in honor full seldom thus hath faith been \r\rkept." \r\r1848 \rThen unto Queen Kriemhild were the tidings borne, \rHow her men did fail their purpose: \'twas cause for her to mourn. \rYet otherwise she wrought it, for grim she was of mood: \rAnon through her must perish full many a valorous knight and \r\rgood. \r\rTHIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE \r\r1bow tbeg went to ^Bbass \r\r1849 \r"So cool doth grow my armor," Volker made remark, \r"I ween but little longer will endure the dark. \rBy the air do I perceive it, that soon will break the day." \rThen waked they many a warrior who still in deepest slumber lay. \r\r1850 \rWhen brake the light of morning athwart the spacious hall, \rHagen gan awaken the stranger warriors all, \rIf that they to the minster would go to holy mass. \rAfter the Christian custom, of bells a mickle ringing was. \r\r1851 \rThere sang they all uneven, that plainly might ye see \rHow Christian men and heathen did not full well agree. \rEach one of Gunther\'s warriors would hear the service sung, \rSo were they all together up from their night-couches sprung. \r\r1852 \rThen did the warriors lace them in so goodly dress, \rThat never heroes any, that king did e\'er possess, \rMore richly stood attired; that Hagen grieved to see. \rQuoth he: "Ye knights, far other here must your attire be. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY WENT TO MASS 273 \r\r1853 \r"Yea, know among you many how here the case doth stand. \r\rBear ye instead of roses your good swords in hand, \r\rFor chaplets all bejewelled your glancing helmets good, \r\rSince we have well perceived how is the angry Kriemhild\'s mood. \r\r1854 \r"To-day must we do battle, that will I now declare. \rInstead of silken tunic shall ye good hauberks wear, \rAnd for embroidered mantle a trusty shield and wide, \rThat ye may well defend you, if ye must others\' anger bide. \r\ri8S5 \r"My masters well beloved, knights and kinsmen true, \r\'Tis meet that ye betake you unto the minster too, \rThat God do not forsake you in peril and in need, \rFor certain now I make you that death is nigh to us indeed. \r\r1856 \r" Forget ye not whatever wrong ye e\'er have done, \rBut there \'fore God right meekly all your errors own; \rThereto would I advise you, ye knights of high degree, \rFor God alone in heaven may will that other mass ye see." \r\r1857 \rThus went they to the minster, the princes and their men. \rWithin the holy churchyard bade them Hagen then \rStand all still together that they part not at all. \rQuoth he : " Knows not any what may at hands of Huns befall. \r\r1858 \r" Let stand, good friends, all ready, your shields before your feet, \rThat if ever any would you in malice greet, \rWith deep-cut wound ye pay him; that is Hagen\'s rede, \rThat from men may never aught but praises be your meed." \r\r1859 \rVolker and Hagen, the twain thence did pass \rBefore the broad minster. Therein their purpose was \rThat the royal Kriemhild must meet them where they stood \rThere athwart her pathway. In sooth full grim she was of mood. \r\r\r\r274 THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE . \r\ri860 \rThen came the royal Etzel and eke his spouse full fair. \rAttired were the warriors all in raiment rare \rThat following full stately with her ye might see; \rThe dust arose all densely round Kriemhild\'s mickle company. \r\r1861 \rWhen the lofty monarch thus all armed did see \rThe kings and their followers, straightway then cried he: \r" How see I in this fashion my friends with helm on head ? \rBy my troth I sorrow if ill to them have happened. \r\r1862 \r"I\'ll gladly make atonement as doth to them belong. \rHath any them affronted or done them aught of wrong, \rTo me \'tis mickle sorrow, well may they understand. \rTo serve them am I ready, in whatsoever they command." \r\r1863 \rThereto gave answer Hagen: " Here hath wronged us none. \r\'Tis custom of my masters to keep their armor on \rTill full three days be over, when high festival they hold. \rDid any here molest us, to Etzel would the thing be told." \r\r1864 \rFull well heard Kriemhild likewise how Hagen gave reply. \rUpon him what fierce glances flashed furtively her eye! \rYet betray she would not the custom of her country, \rThough well she long had known it in the land of Burgundy. \r\r1865 \rHow grim soe\'er and mighty the hate to them she bore, \rHad any told to Etzel how stood the thing before, \rWell had he prevented what there anon befell. \rSo haughty were they minded that none to him the same would telL \r\r1866 \rWith the queen came forward there a mighty train, \rBut no two handbreadths yielded yet those warriors twain \rTo make way before her. The Huns did wrathful grow, \rThat their mistress passing should by them be jostled so. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY WENT TO MASS 275 \r\r1867 \rEtzel\'s highborn pages were sore displeased thereat, \rAnd had upon the strangers straightway spent their hate, \rBut that they durst not do it their high lord before. \rThere was a niickle pressing, yet naught of anger happened more. \r\r1868 \rWhen they thence were parting from holy service done, \rOn horse came quickly prancing full many a nimble Hun. \rWith the Lady Kriemhild went many a maiden fair, \rAnd eke to make her escort seven thousand knights rode there. \r\r1869 \rKriemhild with her ladies within the casement sat \rBy Etzel, mighty monarch, \xc3\x91 full pleased he was thereat. \rThey wished to view the tourney of knights beyond compare. \rWhat host of strangers ridinc thronged the court before them there! \r\r1870 \rThe marshal with the squires not in vain ye sought, \rDankwart the full valiant: with him had he brought \rHis royal master\'s followers of the land of Burgundy. \rFor the valiant Nibelungen the steeds well saddled might ye see. \r\r1871 \rWhen their steeds they mounted, the kings and all their men, \rVolker thane full doughty, gave his counsel then, \rThat after their country\'s fashion they ride a mass mellay. \rHis rede the heroes followed and tourneyed in full stately way. \r\r1872 \rThe knight had counsel given in sooth that pleased them well; \rThe clash of arms in mellay soon full loud did swell. \rMany a valiant warrior did thereto resort, \rAs Etzel and Kriemhild looked down upon the spacious court. \r\r1873 \rCame there unto the mellay six hundred knights of those \rThat followed Dietrich\'s bidding, the strangers to oppose. \rPastime would they make them with the men of Burgundy, \rAnd if he leave had granted, had done the same right willingly. \r\r\r\r276 THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1874 \rIn their company rode there how many a warrior bold! \rWhen unto Sir Dietrich then the thing was told, \rForbade he that \'gainst Gunther\'s men they join the play. \rHe feared lest harm befall them, and well his counsel did he weigh. \r\rWhen of Bern the warriors thence departed were, \rCame they of Bechelaren, the men of Ruediger, \rBearing shield five hundred, and rode before the hall; \rRather had the margrave that they came there not at all. \r\r1876 \rPrudently then rode he amid their company \rAnd told unto his warriors how they might plainly see, \rThat the men of Gunther were in evil mood: \rDid they forego the mellay, please him better far it would. \r\r1877 \rWhen they were thence departed, the stately knights and bold, \rCame they of Thuringia, as hath to us been told, \rAnd of them of Denmark a thousand warriors keen. \rFrom crash of spear up-flying full frequent were the splinters seen. \r\r1878 \rIrnfried and Hawart rode into the mellay, \rWhom the gallant men of Rhineland received in knightly play: \rFull oft the men of Thuringia they met in tournament, \rWhereby the piercing lance-point through many a stately shield was \rsent. \r\r1879 \rEke with three thousand warriors came Sir Bloedel there. \rEtzel and Kriemhild were of his coming ware, \rAs this play of chivalry before them they did see. \rNow hoped the queen that evil befall the men of Burgundy. \r\r1880 \rSchrutan and Gibecke rode into the mellay, \rEke Ramung and Hornbog after the Hunnish way; \rYet must they come to standstill \'fore the thanes of Burgundy. \rHigh against the palace wall the splintered shafts did fly. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY WENT TO MASS 277 \r\r1881 \rHow keen soe\'er the contest, \'twas naught but knightly sport. \rWith shock of shields and lances heard ye the palace court \rLoud give back the echo where Gunther\'s men rode on. \rHis followers in the jousting on every side high honor won. \r\r1882 \rSo long they held such pastime and with so mickle heat \rThat through the broidered trappings oozed clear drops of sweat \rFrom the prancing chargers whereon the knights did ride. \rIn full gallant manner their skill against the Huns they tried. \r\r1883 \rThen outspake the Fiddler, Volker deft of hand: \r"These knights, I ween, too timid are \'gainst us to stand. \rOft did I hear the story what hate to us they bore; \rThan this a fairer season to vent it, find they nevermore." \r\r1884 \r"Lead back unto the stables," once more spake Volker then, \r"Now our weary chargers; we\'ll ride perchance again \rWhen comes the cool of evening, if fitting time there be. \rMayhap the queen will honor award to men of Burgundy." \r\r1885 \rBeheld they then prick hither one dressed in state so rare \rThat of the Huns none other might with him compare. \rBelike from castle tower did watch his fair lady; \rSo gay was his apparel as it some knight\'s bride might be. \r\r1886 \rThen again quoth Volker: "How may I stay my hand? \rYonder ladies\' darling a knock shall understand. \rLet no man here deter me, I\'ll give him sudden check. \rHow spouse of royal Etzel thereat may rage, I little reck." \r\r1887 \r"Nay, as thou dost love me," straight King Gunther spake; \r"All men will but reproach us if such affront we make. \rThe Huns be first offenders, for such would more befit." \rStill did the royal Etzel in casement by Queen Kriemhild sit. \r\r\r\r278 THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1888 \r"I\'ll add unto the mellay," Hagen did declare; \r"Let now all these ladies and knights be made aware \rHow we can ride a charger; \'twere well we make it known, \rFor, come what may, small honor shall here to Gunther\'s men be \rshown." \r\r1889 \rOnce more the nimble Volker into the mellay spurred, \rWhereat full many a lady soon to weep was heard. \rHis lance right through the body of that gay Hun he sent: \r\'Twas cause that many a woman and maiden fair must sore lament. \r\r1890 \rStraight dashed into the mellay Hagen and his men. \rWith three score of his warriors spurred he quickly then \rForward where the Fiddler played so lustily. \rEtzel and Kriemhild full plainly might the passage see. \r\r1891 \rThen would the kings their minstrel \xc3\x91 that may ye fairly know \xc3\x91 \rLeave not all defenceless there amid the foe. \rWith them a thousand heroes rode forth full dexterously, \rAnd soon had gained their purpose with show of proudest chivalry. \r\r1892 \rWhen in such rude fashion the stately Hun was slain, \rMight ye hear his kinsmen weeping loud complain. \rThen all around did clamor: "Who hath the slayer been?" \r"None but the Fiddler was it, Volker the minstrel keen." \r\r1893 \rFor swords and for shields then called full speedily \rThat slain margrave\'s kinsmen of the Hun\'s country. \rTo avenge him sought they Volker in turn to slay. \rIn haste down from the casement royal Etzel made his way. \r\r1894 \rArose a mighty clamor from the people all; \rThe kings and men of Burgundy dismounted \'fore the hall, \rAnd likewise their chargers to the rear did send. \rCame then the mighty Etzel and sought to bring the strife to end. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY WENT TO MASS 279 \r\r1895 \rFrom one of that Hun\'s kinsmen who near by him did stand \r\rSnatched he a mighty weapon quick from out his hand, \r\rAnd therewith backward smote them, for fierce his anger wrought. \r\r"Shall thus my hospitality unto these knights be brought to \r\rnaught?" \r\r1896 \r"If ye the valiant minstrel here \'fore me should slay," \rSpake the royal Etzel, "it were an evil day. \rWhen he the Hun impaled I did observe full well, \rThat not through evil purpose but by mishap it so befell. \r\r1897 \r"These my guests now must ye ne\'er disturb in aught." \rHimself became their escort. Away their steeds were brought \rUnto the stables by many a waiting squire, \rWho ready at their bidding stood to meet their least desire. \r\r1898 \rThe host with the strangers into the palace went, \rNor would he suffer any further his wrath to vent. \rSoon were the tables ready and water for them did wait. \rMany then had gladly on them of Rhineland spent their hate. \r\r1899 \rNot yet the lords were seated till some time was o\'er. \rFor Kriemhild o\'er her sorrow meantime did trouble sore. \rShe spake: "Of Bern, O Master, thy counsel grant to me, \rThy help and eke thy mercy, for here in sorry plight I be." \r\r1900 \rTo her gave answer Hildebrand, a thane right praiseworthy: \r"Who harms the Nibelungen shall ne\'er have help of me, \rHow great soe\'er the guerdon. Such deed he well may rue, \rFor never yet did any these gallant doughty knights subdue." \r\r1901 \rEke in courteous manner Sir Dietrich her addressed: \r"Vain, O lofty mistress, unto me thy quest. \rIn sooth thy lofty kinsmen have wronged me not at all, \rThat I on thanes so valorous should thus with murderous purpose \rfall. \r\r\r\r28o THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1902 \r"Thy prayer doth thee small honor, O high and royal dame, \rThat upon thy kinsmen thou so dost counsel shame. \rThy grace to have they deemed when came they to this land. \rNevermore shall Siegfried avenged be by Dietrich\'s hand." \r\r1903 \rWhen she no guile discovered in the knight of Bern, \rUnto Bloedel straightway did she hopeful turn \rWith promise of wide marches that Nudung erst did own. \rSlew him later Dankwart that he forgot the gift full soon. \r\r1904 \rSpake she: " Do thou help me, Sir Bloedel, I pray. \rYea, within the palace are foes of mine this day, \rWho erstwhile slew Siegfried, spouse full dear to me. \rWho helps me to avenge it, to him I\'ll e\'er beholden be." \r\r!9\xc2\xa15 \rThereto gave answer Bloedel: "Lady, be well aware, \r\rNe\'er to do them evil \'fore Etzel may I dare, \r\rFor to thy kinsmen, lady, beareth he good will. \r\rNe\'er might the king me pardon, wrought I upon them aught of ill." \r\r1906 \r" But nay, Sir Bloedel, my favor shalt thou have evermore. \rYea, give I thee for guerdon silver and gold in store, \rAnd eke a fairest lady, that Nudung erst should wed: \rBy her fond embraces may\'st thou well be comforted. \r\r1907 \r" The land and eke the castles, all to thee I\'ll give; \rYea, may\'st thou, knight full noble, in joyance ever live, \rCall\'st thou thine the marches, wherein did Nudung dwell. \rWhate\'er this day I promise, fulfil it all I will full well." \r\r1908 \rWhen understood Sir Bloedel what gain should be his share, \rAnd pleased him well the lady for that she was so fair, \rBy force of arms then thought he to win her for his wife. \rThereby the knight aspirant was doomed anon to lose his life. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY WENT TO MASS 281 \r\r1909 \r" Unto the hall betake thee," quoth he unto the queen, \r" Alarum I will make thee ere any know, I ween. \rAtone shall surely Hagen where he hath done thee wrong: \rTo thee I\'ll soon give over King Gunther\'s man in fetters strong." \r\r1910 \r"To arms, to arms!" quoth Bloedel, "my good warriors all: \rIn their followers\' quarters upon the foe we\'ll fall. \rHerefrom will not release me royal Etzel\'s wife. \rTo win this venture therefore fear not each one to lose his life." \r\r1911 \rWhen at length Queen Kriemhild found Bloedel well content \rTo fulfil her bidding, she to table went \rWith the monarch Etzel and eke a goodly band. \rDire was the treason she against the guests had planned. \r\r1912 \rSince in none other manner she knew the strife to start, \r(Kriemhild\'s ancient sorrow still rankled in her heart), \rBade she bring to table Etzel\'s youthful son: \rBy woman bent on vengeance how might more awful deed be done ? \r\ri9 J 3 \rWent upon the instant four of Etzel\'s men, \r\rAnd soon came bearing Ortlieb, the royal scion, then \r\rUnto the princes\' table, where eke grim Hagen sate. \r\rThe child was doomed to perish by reason of his deadly hate. \r\r1914 \rWhen the mighty monarch then his child did see, \rUnto his lady\'s kinsmen in manner kind spake he : \r" Now, my good friends, behold ye here my only son, \rAnd child of your high sister: may it bring you profit every one. \r\r19*5 \r\r" Grow he but like his kindred, a valiant man he\'ll be, \r\rA mighty king and noble, doughty and fair to see. \r\rLive I but yet a little, twelve lands shall he command; \r\rMay ye have faithful service from the youthful Ortlieb\'s hand. \r\r\r\r282 THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE \r\r1916 \r"Therefore grant me favor, ye good friends of mine; \rWhen to your country ride, ye again unto the Rhine, \rShall ye then take with you this your sister\'s son, \rAnd at your hands may ever by the child full fair be done. \r\r1917 \r"Bring him up in honor until to manhood grown. \rIf then in any country hath wrong to you been done, \rHe\'ll help you by his valor vengeance swift to wreak." \rEke heard the Lady Kriemhild royal Etzel thus to speak. \r\r1918 \r"Well might these my masters on his faith rely, \rGrew he e\'er to manhood," Hagen made reply: \r"Yet is the prince, I fear me, more early doomed of fate. \r\'Twere strange did any see me ever at court on Ortlieb wait." \r\r1919 \rThe monarch glanced at Hagen, sore grieved at what he heard; \rAlthough the king full gallant thereto spake ne\'er a word, \rNatheless his heart was saddened and heavy was his mind. \rNowise the mood of Hagen was to merriment inclined. \r\r1920 \rIt grieved all the princes and the royal host \rThat of his child did Hagen make such idle boast. \rThat they must likewise leave it unanswered, liked they not: \rThey little weaned what havoc should by the thane anon be wrought. \r\r\r\rTHIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE \r\r\xc2\xa5fcow JBloe&el was Slain \r\r1921 \rThe knights by Bloedel summoned soon armed and ready were, \rA thousand wearing hauberks straightway did repair \rWhere Dankwart sat at table with many a goodly squire. \rSoon knight on knight was seeking in fiercest way to vent his ire. \r\r\r\rHOW BLOEDEL WAS SLAIN 283 \r\r1922 \rWhen there Sir Bloedel strode unto the board, \rDankwart the marshal thus :poke courteous word: \r"Unto this hall right welcome good Sir Bloedel be. \rWhat business hast thou hither is cause of wonder yet to me." \r\r1923 \r"No greeting here befits thee," spake Bloedel presently, \r"For that this my coming now thy end must be, \rThrough Hagen\'s fault, thy brother, who Siegfried erstwhile slew. \rTo the Huns thou mak\'st atonement, and many another warrior \rtoo." \r\r1924 \r"But nay, but nay, Sir Bloedel," Dankwart spake thereto, \r"For so should we have reason our coming here to rue. \rA child I was and little when Siegfried lost his life, \rNor know I why reproacheth me the royal Etzel\'s wife." \r\r192S \r"In sooth I may the story never fully tell. \r\rGunther and Hagen was it by whom the deed befell. \r\rNow guard you well, ye strangers, for doomed in sooth are ye, \r\rUnto Lady Kriemhild must your lives now forfeit be." \r\r1926 \r"An so thou wilt desist not," Dankwart declared, \r"Regret I my entreaty, my toil were better spared." \rThe nimble thane and valiant up from the table sprung, \rAnd drew a keen-edged weapon, great in sooth that was and long. \r\r1927 \rThen smote he with it Bloedel such a sudden blow \rThat his head full sudden before his feet lay low. \r"Be that thy wedding-dower," the doughty Dankwart spake, \r"Along with bride of Nudung whom thou would\'st to thy bosom \rtake. \r\r1928 \r"To-morrow may she marry, but some other one: \rWill he have bridal portion, e\'en so to him be done." \rA Hun that liked not treason had given him to know \rHow that the queen upon him thought to work so grievous woe. \r\r\r\r284 THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1929 \rWhen the men of Bloedel saw thus their master slain, \rTo fall upon the strangers would they longer not refrain. \rWith swords swung high above them upon the squires they flew \rIn a grimmest humor. Soon many must that rashness rue. \r\r1930 \rFull loudly cried then Dankwart to all his company: \r"Behold ye, noble squires, the fate that ours must be. \rNow quit yourselves with valor, for evil is our pass, \rThough fair to us the summons hither from Lady Kriemhild was ! " \r\r193 1 \rThey, too, reached down before them, who no weapons bore, \rAnd each a massive footstool snatched from off the floor, \rFor the Burgundian squires no whit were they dismayed; \rAnd by the selfsame weapons was many a dint in helmet made. \r\r1932 \rHow fierce they fought to shield them the strangers one and all! \rE\'en their armed foemen drove they from the hall. \rOr smote dead within it hundreds five or more; \rAll the valiant fighters saw ye drenched with ruddy gore. \r\r1933 \rEre long the wondrous tidings some messenger did tell \rUnto Etzel\'s chieftain \xc3\x91fierce did their anger swell- \rHow that slain was Bloedel and knights full many a one; \rThe which had Hagen\'s brother with his lusty squires done. \r\r1934 \rThe Huns, by anger driven, ere Etzel was aware, \rTwo thousand men or over, did quick themselves prepare. \rThey fell upon those squires \xc3\x91e\'en so it had to be\xc3\x91 \rAnd never any living they left of all that company. \r\r1935 \rA mickle host they faithless unto those quarters brought, \rBut lustily the strangers \'gainst their assailants fought. \rWhat booted swiftest valor? Soon must all lie dead. \rA dire woe thereafter on many a man was visited. \r\r\r\rHOW BLOEDEL WAS SLAIN 285 \r\r1936 \rNow may ye hear a wondrous tale of honor told: \rOf squires full nine thousand soon in death lay cold, \rAnd eke good knights a dozen there of Dankwart\'s band. \rForlorn ye saw him only the last amid his foemen stand. \r\r1937 \rThe din at last was ended and lulled the battle-sound, \rWhen the valiant Dankwart did cast a glance around. \r"Alack for my companions," cried he, "now from me reft \rAlack that I now only forlorn amid my foes am left." \r\r1938 \rThe swords upon his body fell full thick and fast, \rWhich rashness many a warrior\'s widow mourned at last. \rHis shield he higher lifted and drew the strap more low: \rDown coats of ring-made armor made he the ebbing blood to flow. \r\r1939 \r"O woe is me!" spake Dankwart, the son of Aldrian. \r"Now back, ye Hunnish fighters, let me the open gain, \rThat the air give cooling to me storm-weary wight." \rIn splendid valor moving strode forward then anew the knight. \r\r1940 \rAs thus he battle-weary through the hall\'s portal sprang, \rWhat swords of new-come fighters upon his helmet rang! \rThey who not yet had witnessed what wonders wrought his hand, \rRashly rushed they forward to thwart him of Burgundian land. \r\r1941 \r"Now would to God," quoth Dankwart, "I found a messenger \rWho to my brother Hagen might the tidings bear, \rThat \'fore host of foemen in such sad case am I! \rFrom hence he\'d surely help me, or by my side he slain would He." \r\r1942 \rThen Hunnish knights gave answer: "Thyself the messenger \rShalt be, when to thy brother thee a corse we bear. \rSo shall that thane of Gunther first true sorrow know. \rUpon the royal Etzel here hast thou wrought so grievous woe." \r\r\r\r2 S6 THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1943 \rQuoth he: "Now leave such boasting and yield me passage free, \rElse shall mail-rings a many with blood bespattered be. \rMyself will tell the tidings soon at Etzel\'s court, \rAnd eke unto my masters of this my travail make report." \r\r1944 \rEtzel\'s men around him belabored he so sore \rThat they at sword-point durst not withstand him more. \rSpears shot into his shield he so many there did stop \rThat he the weight unwieldy must from out his hand let drop. \r\rJ 945 \rThen thought they to subdue him thus of his shield bereft, \rBut lo! the mighty gashes wherewith he helmets cleft! \rMust there keen knights full many before him stagger down, \rHigh praise the valiant Dankwart thereby for his valor won. \r\r1946 \rOn right side and on left side they still beset his way, \rYet many a one too rashly did mingle in the fray. \rThus strode he \'mid the foemen as doth in wood the boar \rBy yelping hounds beleaguered ; more stoutly fought he ne\'er before. \r\rJ 947 \rAs there he went, his pathway with reeking blood was wet. \rYea, never any hero more bravely battled yet \rWhen by foes surrounded, than he did might display. \rTo court did Hagen\'s brother with splendid valor make his way. \r\r1948 \rWhen stewards and cup-bearers heard how sword-blades rung, \rMany a brimming goblet from their hands they flung \rAnd eke the viands ready that they to table bore; \rThus many doughty foemen withstood him where he sought the \rdoor. \r\r1949 \r" How now, ye stewards ? " cried the weary knight ; \r" \'Twere better that ye tended rather your guests aright, \rBearing to lords at table choice food that fitteth well, \rAnd suffered me these tidings unto my masters dear to tell." \r\r\r\rHOW BLOEDEL WAS SLAIN 287 \r\r\r\r19S0 \rWhoe\'er before him rashly athwart the stairway sprung, \rOn him with blow so heavy his mighty sword he swung, \rThat soon faint heart gave warning before his path to yield. \rMickle wonder wrought he where sword his doughty arm did wield. \r\r\r\rTHIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE \r1bow tbe JSurgunoians fougbt wftb tbe Ibuns \r\rI95 1 \r\rSoon as the valiant Dankwart stood beneath the door, \r\rBade he Etzel\'s followers all make way before. \r\rWith blood from armor streaming did there the hero stand; \r\rA sharp and mighty weapon bore he naked in his hand. \r\rI95 2 \rInto the hall then Dankwart cried with voice full strong: \r" At table, brother Hagen, thou sittest all too long. \rTo thee and God in heaven must I sore complain: \rKnights and squires also lie within their lodging slain." \r\r1953 \rStraight he cried in answer: "Who hath done such deed?" \r" That hath done Sir Bloedel and knights that he did lead. \rEke made he meet atonement, that may\'st thou understand: \rHis head from off his body have I struck with mine own hand." \r\r1954 \r" \'Tis little cause for sorrow," Hagen spake again, \r" When they tell the story of a valiant thane, \rThat he to death was smitten by knight of high degree. \rThe less a cause for weeping to winsome women shall it be. \r\r1955 \r"Now tell me, brother Dankwart, how thou so red may\'st be; \rFrom thy wounds thou sufferest, I ween, full grievously. \rLives he within this country who serves thee in such way, \rHim must the devil shelter, or for the deed his life shall pay." \r\r\r\r288 THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE \r\r1956 \r" Behold me here all scatheless. My gear is wet with blood, \rFrom wounds of others, natheless, now hath flowed that flood, \rOf whom this day so many beneath my broadsword fell: \rMust I make solemn witness, ne\'er knew I full the tale to tell." \r\r1957 \rHe answered: "Brother Dankwart, now take thy stand before, \rAnd Huns let never any make passage by the door. \rI\'ll speak unto these warriors, as needs must spoken be: \rDead he all our followers, slain by foulest treachery." \r\r1958 \r"Must I here be chamberlain," replied the warrior keen, \r" Well know I such high monarchs aright to serve, I ween. \rSo will I guard the stairway as sorts with honor well." \rNe\'er to the thanes of Kriemhild so sorry case before befell. \r\r1959 \r"To me \'tis mickle wonder," Hagen spake again, \r"What thing unto his neighbor whispers each Hunnish thane. \rI ween they\'d forego the service of him who keeps the door, \rAnd who such high court tidings to his friends of Burgundy bore. \r\ri960 \r" Long since of Lady Kriemhild the story I did hear, \rHow unavenged her sorrow she might no longer bear. \rA memory-cup now quaff we and pay for royal cheer 1 \rThe youthful lord of Hunland shall make the first instalment here." \r\r1961 \rThereat the child Ortlieb doughty Hagen slew, \rThat from the sword downward the blood to hand-grip flew, \rAnd into lap of Kriemhild the severed head down rolled. \rThen might ye see \'mid warriors a slaughter great and grim unfold. \r\r1962 \rBy both hands swiftly wielded, his blade then cut the air \rAnd smote upon the tutor who had the child in care, \rThat down before the table his head that instant lay: \rIt was a sorry payment wherewith he did the tutor pay. \r\r\r\rTHE BURGUNDIANS AND THE HUNS 289 \r\r1963 \rHis eye \'fore Etzel\'s table a minstrel espied: \rTo whom in hasty manner did wrathful Hagen stride, \rWhere moved it on the fiddle his right hand off smote he; \r"Have that for thy message unto the land of Burgundy." \r\r1964 \r"Alack my hand!" did Werbel that same minstrel moan* \r"What, Sir Hagen of Tronje, have I to thee done? \rI bore a faithful message unto thy master\'s land. \rHow may I more make music thus by thee bereft of hand?" \r\r1965 \rLittle in sooth recked Hagen, fiddled he nevermore. \r\rThen in the hall all wrathful wrought he havoc sore \r\rUpon the thanes of Etzel whereof he many slew; \r\rEre they might find exit, to death then smote he not a few. \r\r1966 \rVolker the full valiant up sprang from board also: \rIn his hand full clearly rang out his fiddle-bow, \rFor mightily did fiddle Gunther\'s minstrel thane. \rWhat host of foes he made him because of Hunnish warriors slain! \r\r1967 \rEke sprang from the table the lofty monarchs three, \rWho glad had stilled the combat ere greater scathe might be. \rYet all their art availed not their anger to assuage, \rWhen Volker and Hagen so mightily began to rage. \r\r1968 \rWhen the lord of Rhineland saw how his toil was vain, \rGaping wounds full many himself did smite amain \rThrough rings of shining mail-coats there upon the foe. \rHe was a valiant hero, as he full gallantly did show. \r\r1969 \rStrode eke into the combat Gemot a doughty thane; \rBy whom of Hunnish warriors full many a one was slain \rWith a sword sharp-edged he had of Ruediger; \rOft sent to dire ruin by him the knights of Etzel were. \r\r\r\r29 o THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE \r\r1970 \rThe youthful son of Ute eke to the combat sprang, \rAnd merrily his broadsword upon the helmets rang \rOf many a Hunnish warrior there in Etzel\'s land; \rFeasts of mickle wonder wrought Giselher with dauntless hand. \r\r1971 \rHow bold soe\'er was any, of kings and warrior band, \rSaw ye yet the foremost Giselher to stand \rThere against the foemen, a knight of valor good; \rWounded deep full many made he to fall in oozing blood. \r\r1972 \rEke full well defend them did Etzel\'s warriors too. \rThere might ye see the strangers their gory way to hew \rWith swords all brightly gleaming adown that royal hall; \rHeard ye there on all sides loudly ring the battle-call. \r\r1973 \rJoin friends within beleaguered would they without full fain, \rYet might they at the portal but little vantage gain. \rEke they within had gladly gained the outer air; \rNor up nor down did Dankwart suffer one to pass the stair. \r\r1974 \rThere before the portal surged a mighty throng, \rAnd with a mickle clangor on helm the broadsword rung. \rThus on the valiant Dankwart his foes did sorely press, \rAnd soon his trusty brother was anxious grown o\'er his distress. \r\r1975 \rFull loudly cried then Hagen unto Volker: \r"Trusty fere, behold\'st thou my brother standing there, \rWhere on him Hunnish warriors their mighty blows do rain? \rGood friend, save thou my brother ere we do lose the valiant \r\rthane." \r\r1976 \r"That will I do full surely," thereat the minstrel spake. \rAdown the hall he fiddling gan his way to make; \rIn his hand full often a trusty sword rang out, \rWhile grateful knights of Rhineland acclaimed him with a mickle \r\rshout. \r\r\r\rTHE BURGUNDIANS AND THE HUNS 291 \r\r1977 \rSoon did the valiant Volker Dankwart thus address: \r"Hard this day upon thee hath weighed the battle\'s stress. \rThat I should come to help thee thy brother gave command; \rKeep thou without the portal, I inward guarding here will stand." \r\r1978 \rDankwart, thane right valiant, stood without the door \rAnd guarded so the stairway that none might pass before. \rThere heard ye broadswords ringing, swung by warrior\'s hand, \rWhile inward in like manner wrought Volker of Burgundian land. \r\r1979 \rThere the valiant Fiddler above the press did call: \r"Securely now, friend Hagen, closed is the hall. \rYea, so firmly bolted is King Etzel\'s door \rBy hands of two good warriors, as thousand bars were set before." \r\r1980 \rWhen Hagen thus of Tronje the door did guarded find, \rThe warrior far renowned swung his shield behind; \rHe first for harm received revenge began to take, \rWhereat all hope of living did soon his enemies forsake. \r\r1981 \rWhen of Bern Sir Dietrich rightly did perceive \rHow the doughty Hagen did many a helmet cleave, \rThe king of Amelungen upon a bench leaped up; \rQuoth he: "Here poureth Hagen for us exceeding bitter cup." \r\r1982 \rGreat fear fell eke on Etzel, as well might be the case, \r(What trusty followers snatched they to death before his face!) \rFor well nigh did his enemies on him destruction bring. \rThere sat he all confounded. What booted him to be a king? \r\r1983 \rCried then aloud to Dietrich Kriemhild, the high lady: \r"Now help me, knight so noble, that hence with life I flee, \rBy princely worth, I pray thee, thou lord of Amelung\'s land; \rIf here do reach me Hagen, straight find I death beneath his hand." \r\r\r\r2 9 2 THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r1984 \r"How may my help avail thee, noble queen and high?" \rAnswered her Sir Dietrich, "Fear for myself have I. \rToo sorely is enraged each knight in Gunther\'s band, \rTo no one at this season may I lend assisting hand." \r\r1985 \r"But nay, but nay, Sir Dietrich, full noble knight and keen, \rWhat maketh thy bright chivalry, let it this day be seen, \rAnd bring me hence to safety, else am I death\'s sure prey." \rGood cause was that on Kriemhild\'s bosom fear so heavy lay. \r\r1986 \r"So will I here endeavor to help thee as I may; \rYet shalt thou well believe me, hath passed full many a day \rSince saw I goodly warriors of so bitter mood. \r\'Neath swords behold I flowing through helmets plenteously the \rblood." \r\r1987 \rLustily then cried he, the warrior nobly born, \rThat his voice rang loudly like blast from bison\'s horn, \rThat all around the palace gave back the lusty sound; \rUnto the might of Dietrich never limit yet was found. \r\r1988 \rWhen did hear King Gunther how called the doughty man \rAbove the storm of combat, to hearken he began. \rQuoth he: "The voice of Dietrich hath fallen upon mine ear; \rI ween some of his followers before our thanes have fallen here. \r\r1989 \r"High on the board I see him; he beckons with the hand. \rNow my good friends and kinsmen of Burgundian land, \rStay ye your hands from conflict, let us hear and see \rIf done upon the chieftain aught by my men of scathe there be." \r\r1990 \rWhen thus King Gunther did beg and eke command, \rWith swords in stress of battle stayed they all the hand. \r\'Twas token of his power that straight the strife did pause. \rThen him of Bern he questioned what of his outcry were the cause. \r\r\r\rTHE BURGUNDIANS AND THE HUNS 293 \r\r1991 \r\rHe spake: "Full noble Dietrich, what here on thee is wrought \r\rBy any of my warriors? For truly is my thought \r\rTo make a full atonement and amends to thee. \r\rIf here hath wronged thee any, \'twere cause of mickle grief to me." \r\r1992 \rThen answered him Sir Dietrich: " Myself do nothing grieve. \rGrant me with thy protection but this hall to leave \rAnd quit the dire conflict, with them that me obey. \rThen surely will I ever seek thy favor to repay." \r\rJ 993 \r"How plead\' st thou thus so early?" Wolfhart was heard; \r\r" The Fiddler so securely the door not yet hath barred, \rBut it so wide we\'ll open to pass it through, I trow." \r" Now hold thy peace," quoth Dietrich, " wrought but little here hast \rthou." \r\r1994 \rThen spake the royal Gunther: "That grant I thee to do, \rForth from the hall lead many or lead with thee few, \rAn if my foes it be not; here stay they every one. \rUponmeherein Hunland hath grievous wrong by them been do ne . " \r\r1995 \rWhen heard he Gunther\'s answer he took beneath his arm \r\rThe noble Queen Kriemhild, who dreaded mickle harm. \r\rOn the other side too led he Etzel with him away; \r\rEke went thence with Dietrich six hundred knights in fair array. \r\r1996 \rThen outspake the margrave, the noble Ruediger: \r" If leave to any others be granted forth to fare, \rOf those who glad would serve you, give us the same to see. \rYea, peace that\'s never broken \'twixt friends \'tis meet should ever \rbe." \r\r1997 \rThereto gave answer Giselher of the land of Burgundy: \r"Peace and unbroken friendship wish we e\'er with thee, \rWith thee and all thy kinsmen, as true thou ever art. \rWe grant thee all untroubled with thy friends from hence to part." \r\r\r\r294 THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE \r\r1998 \rWhen thus Sir Ruediger from the hall did pass, \rA train of knights five hundred or more with him there was, \rOf them of Bechelaren, kinsmen and warriors true, \rWhose parting gave King Gunther anon full mickle cause to rue. \r\r1999 \rWhen did a Hunnish warrior Etzel\'s passing see \r\'Neath the arm of Dietrich, to profit him thought he. \rSmote him yet the Fiddler, such a mighty blow, \rThat \'fore the feet of Etzel sheer on the floor his head fell low. \r\r2000 \xc2\xa5 \rWhen the country\'s monarch had gained the outer air, \rTurned he looking backward and gazed on Volker. \r"Alack such guests to harbor! Ah me discomfited! \rThat all the knights that serve me shall before their might he dead. \r\r2001 \r"Alack their coming hither!" spake the king once more. \r"Within, a warrior fighteth like to wild forest boar; \rHight the same is Volker, and a minstrel is also; \rTo pass the demon scatheless I to fortune\'s favor owe. \r\r2002 \r" Evil sound his melodies, his strokes of bow are red, \rYea, beneath his music full many a knight lies dead. \rI know not what against us hath stirred that player\'s ire, \rFor guests ne\'er had I any whereby to suffer woe so dire." \r\r2003 \rNone other would they suffer to pass the door than those. \rThen \'neath the hall\'s high roof-tree a mighty din arose. \rFor evil wrought upon them those guests sore vengeance take. \rVolker the doughty Fiddler, what shining helmets there he brake! \r\r2004 \rGunther, lofty monarch, thither turned his ear. \r" Hear\'st thou the music, Hagen, that yonder Volker \rDoth fiddle for the Hun-men, when near the door they go ? \rThe stroke is red of color, where he doth draw the fiddle-bow." \r\r\r\rTHE BURGUNDIANS AND THE HUNS 295 \r\r2005 \r"Mickle doth it rue me," Hagen spake again, \r" That in the hall far severed I am from that bold thane. \rI was his boon companion and he sworn friend to me: \rCome we hence ever scatheless, trusty feres we yet shall be. \r\r2006 \r"Behold now, lofty sire, the faith of Volker bold! \rWith will he seeks to win him thy silver and thy gold. \rWith fiddle-bow he cleaveth e\'en the steel so hard, \rBright-gleaming crests of helmets are scattered by his mighty sword. \r\r2007 \r" Never saw I fiddler so dauntless heart display, \rAs the doughty Volker here hath done this day. \rThrough shield and shining helmet his melodies ring clear; \rGive him to ride good charger and eke full stately raiment wear." \r\r2008 \rOf all the Hunnish kindred that in the hall had been, \rNone now of all their number therein to fight was seen. \rHushed was the din of battle and strife no more was made: \rFrom out their hands aweary their swords the dauntless warriors \rlaid. \r\rTHIRTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r1bow tbeg cast out tbe 2>eao \r\r2009 \rFrom toil of battle weary rested the warriors all. \rVolker and Hagen passed out before the hall, \rAnd on their shields did lean them, those knights whom naught \r\rcould daunt. \rThen with full merry converse gan the twain their foes to taunt. \r\r2010 \rSpake meanwhile of Burgundy Giselher the thane: \r"Not yet, good friends, may ye think to rest again. \rForth from the hall the corses shall ye rather bear. \rAgain we\'ll be assailed, that would I now in sooth declare. \r\r\r\r296 THIRTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r20II \r\r"Beneath our feet no longer here the dead must lie. \rBut ere in storm of battle at hand of Huns to die, \rWe\'ll deal such wounds around us as \'tis my joy to see. \rThereon," spake Giselher, "my heart is fixed right steadfastly." \r\r2012 \r"I joy in such a master," Hagen spake again: \r"Such counsel well befitteth alone so valiant thane \rAs my youthful master hath shown himself this day. \rTherefor, O men of Burgundy, every one rejoice ye may, \r\r\r\rit \r\r\r\r2013 \rThen followed they his counsel and from the hall they bore \rSeven thousand bodies and cast them from the door. \rAdown the mounting stairway all together fell, \rWhereat a sound of wailing did from mourning kinsmen swell. \r\r2014 \rMany a man among them so slight wound did bear \rThat he were yet recovered had he but gentle care, \rWho yet falling headlong now surely must be dead. \rThereat did grieve their kinsmen as verily was sorest need. \r\r2015 \rThen outspake the Fiddler, Volker a hero bold: \r"Now do I find how truly hath to me been told \rThat cowards are the Hun-men who do like women weep. \rRather should be their effort their wounded kin alive to keep." \r\r2016 \rThese words deemed a margrave spoken in kindly mood. \rHe saw one of his kinsmen weltering in his blood. \rIn his arms he clasped him and thought him thence to bear, \rBut as he bent above him pierced him the valiant minstrel\'s spear. \r\r2017 \rWhen that beheld the others all in haste they fled, \rCrying each one curses on that same minstrel\'s head. \rFrom the ground then snatched he a spear with point full keen, \rThat \'gainst him up the stairway by a Hun had hurled been. \r\r\r\rHOW THEY CAST OUT THE DEAD 297 \r\r2018 \rAcross the court he flung it with his arm of might \rFar above the people. Then did each Hunnish knight \rSeek him safer quarters more distant from the hall. \rTo see his mighty prowess did fill with fear his foemen all. \r\r2019 \rAs knights full many thousand far \'fore the palace stood, \rVolker and Hagen gan speak in wanton mood \rUnto King Etzel, nor did they aught withhold; \rWherefrom anon did sorrow o\'ertake those doughty warriors bold. \r\r2020 \r" \'Twould well beseem," quoth Hagten, "the people\'s lofty lord \rForemost in storm of battle to swing the cutting sword, \rAs do my royal masters each fair example show. \rWhere hew they through the helmets their swords do make the \rblood to flow." \r\r2021 \rTo hear such words brave Etzel snatched in haste his shield. \r"Now well beware of rashness," cried Lady Kriemhild, \r"And offer to thy warriors gold heaped on shield full high: \rIf yonder Hagen reach thee, straightway shalt thou surely die." \r\r2022 \rSo high was the king\'s mettle that he would not give o\'er, \rWhich case is now full seldom seen in high princes more; \rThey must by shield-strap tugging him perforce restrain. \rGrim of mood then Hagen began him to revile again. \r\r2023 \r"It was a distant kinship," spake Hagen, dauntless knight, \r"That Etzel unto Siegfried ever did unite, \rAnd husband he to Kriemhild was ere thee she knew. \rWherefore, O king faint-hearted, seek\'st thou such thing \'gainst \rme to do?" \r\r2024 \rThereto eke must listen the noble monarch\'s spouse, \rAnd grievously to hear it did Kriemhild\'s wrath arouse, \rThat he \'fore men of Etzel durst herself upbraid; \rTo urge them \'gainst the strangers she once more her arts essayed. \r\r\r\r298 THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2025 \rCried she: "Of Tronje Hagen whoso for me will slay, \rAnd his head from body severed here before me lay, \rFor him the shield of Etzel I\'ll fill with ruddy gold, \rEke lands and lordly castles I\'ll give him for his own to hold.\'\' \r\r2026 \r"I wot not why they tarry," \xc3\x91 thus the minstrel cried; \r"Ne\'er saw I heroes any so their courage hide, \rWhen to them was offered, like this, reward so high. \r\'Tis cause henceforth that Etzel for aye to them goodwill deny." \r\r2027 \r"Who in such craven manner do eat their master\'s bread, \rAnd like caitiffs fail him in time of greatest need, \rHere see I standing many of courage all forlorn, \rYet would be men of valor; all time be they upheld to scorn." \r\r\r\rTHIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r1bow "ffring was Slain \r\r2028 \rCried then he of Denmark, Iring the margrave: \r" Fixed on things of honor my purpose long I have, \rAnd oft in storm of battle, where heroes wrought, was I. \rBring hither now my armor, with Hagen I\'ll the combat try." \r\r2029 \r"I counsel thee against it," Hagen then replied, \r" Or bring a goodly company of Hun-men by thy side. \rIf peradventure any find entrance to the hall, \rI\'ll cause that nowise scatheless down the steps again they fall." \r\r2030 \r"Such words may not dissuade me," Iring spake once more; \r" A thing of equal peril oft have I tried before. \rYea, will I with my broadsword confront thee all alone. \rNor aught may here avail thee thus to speak in haughty tone." \r\r\r\rHOW IRING WAS SLAIN 299 \r\r2031 \rSoon the valiant Iring armed and ready stood, \rAnd Irnfried of Thuringia a youth of mettle good, \rAnd eke the doughty Hawart, with thousand warriors tried. \rWhate\'er his purpose, Iring should find them faithful by his side. \r\r2032 \rAdvancing then with Iring did the Fiddler see \rAll clad in shining armor a mighty company, \rAnd each a well-made helmet securely fastened wore. \rThereat the gallant Volker began to rail in anger sore. \r\r2033 \r"Seest thou, friend Hagen, yonder Iring go, \rWho all alone to front thee with his sword did vow ? \rDoth lying sort with honor? Scorned the thing must be. \rA thousand knights or over here bear him armed company." \r\r2034 \r"Now make me not a liar," cried Hawart\'s man aloud, \r" For firm is still my purpose to do what now I vowed, \rNor will I turn me from it through any cause of fear. \rAlone I\'ll stand \'fore Hagen, awful howsoe\'er he were." \r\r2035 \rOn ground did throw him Iring before his warriors\' feet, \r\rThat they leave might grant him alone the knight to meet. \r\rLoath they were to do it; well known to them might be \r\rThe haughty Hagen\'s prowess of the land of Burgundy. \r\r2036 \rYet so long besought he that granted was their leave; \rWhen they that followed with him did his firm mind perceive, \rAnd how \'twas bent on honor, they not restrained him. \rThen closed the two chieftains together in a combat grim. \r\r2037 \rIring of Denmark raised his spear on high, \rAnd with the shield he covered himself full skilfully; \rHe upward rushed on Hagen unto the hall right close, \rWhen round the clashing fighters soon a mighty din arose. \r\r\r\r3 oo THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r2038 \rEach hurled upon the other the spear with arm of might, \rThat the firm shields were pierced e\'en to their mail-coats bright, \rAnd outward still projecting the long spear-shafts were seen. \rIn haste then snatched their broadswords both the fighters grim and \rkeen. \r\r2039 \rIn might the doughty Hagen and prowess did abound, \rAs Iring smote upon him the hall gave back the sound. \rThe palace all and towers re-echoed from their blows, \rYet might that bold assailant with victory ne\'er the combat close. \r\r2040 \rOn Hagen might not Iring wreak aught of injury. \rUnto the doughty Fiddler in haste then turned he. \rHim by his mighty sword-strokes thought he to subdue, \rBut well the thane full gallant to keep him safe in combat knew. \r\r2041 \rThen smote the doughty Fiddler so lustily his shield \rThat from it flew its ornaments where he the sword did wield. \rIring must leave unconquered there the dauntless man; \rNext upon King Gunther of Burgundy in wrath he ran. \r\r2042 \rThere did each in combat show him man of might; \rHowe\'er did Gunther and Iring yet each the other smite, \rFrom wounds might never either make the blood to flow, \rSo sheltered each his armor, well wrought that was and strong enow. \r\r2043 \rGunther left he standing, upon Gemot to dash, \rAnd when he smote ring-armor the fire forth did flash. \rBut soon had he of Burgundy, Gemot the doughty thane, \rWell nigh his keen assailant Iring of Denmark slain. \r\r2044 \rYet from the prince he freed him, for nimble was he too. \rFour of the men of Burgundy the knight full sudden slew \rOf those that followed with them from Worms across the Rhine. \rThereupon might nothing the wrath of Giselher confine. \r\r\r\rHOW IRING WAS SLAIN 301 \r\r2045 \r" God wot well, Sir Iring," young Giselher then cried, \r"Nov/ must thou make requital for them that here have died \r\'Neath thy hand so sudden." He rushed upon him so \r\rAnd smote the knight of Denmark that he might not withstand the \rblow. \r\r2046 \rInto the blood down fell he staggering \'neath its might, \rThat all who there beheld it might deem the noble knight \rSword again would never wield amid the fray. \rYet \'neath the stroke of Giselher Iring all unwounded lay. \r\r2047 \rBedazed by helmet\'s sounding where ringing sword swung down, \rFull suddenly his senses so from the knight were flown. \rThat of his life no longer harbored he a thought. \rThat the doughty Giselher by his mighty arm had wrought. \r\r2048 \rWhen somewhat was subsided the din within his head \rFrom mighty blow so sudden on him was visited, \rThought he: " I still am living and bear no mortal wound. \rHow great the might of Giselher, till now unwitting, have I found." \r\r2049 \rHe hearkened how on all sides his foes around did stand; \rKnew they what he did purpose, they had not stayed their hand. \rHe heard the voice of Giselher eke in that company, \rAs cunning he bethought him how yet he from his foes might flee. \r\r2050 \rUp from the blood he started with fierce and sudden bound; \rBy grace alone of swiftness he his freedom found. \rWith speed he passed the portal where Hagen yet did stand, \rAnd swift his sword he flourished and smote him with his doughty \rhand. \r\r2051 \rTo see such sight quoth Hagen: " To death thou fall\'st a prey; \rIf not the Devil shield thee, now is thy latest day." \rYet Iring wounded Hagen e\'en through his helmet\'s crown. \rThat did the knight with Waske, a sword that was of far renown. \r\r\r\r3 o2 THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r2052 \rWhen thus Sir Hagen the smart of wound did feel, \rWrathfully he brandished on high his blade of steel. \rFull soon must yield before him Hawart\'s daring man, \rAdown the steps pursuing Hagen swiftly after ran. \r\r2053 \rO\'er his head bold Iring his shield to guard him swung, \rAnd e\'en had that same stairway been full three times as long, \rYet had he found no respite from warding Hagen\'s blows. \rHow plenteously the ruddy sparks above his helm arose! \r\r2054 \rUnscathed at last came Iring where waited him his own. \rSoon as was the story unto Kriemhild known, \rHow that in fight on Hagen he had wrought injury, \rTherefor the Lady Kriemhild him gan to thank full graciously. \r\r2055 \r"Now God requite thee, Iring, thou valiant knight and good, \rFor thou my heart hast comforted and merry made my mood. \rRed with blood his armor, see I yonder Hagen stand." \rFor joy herself did Kriemhild take his shield from out his hand. \r\r2056 \r"Small cause hast thou to thank him," thus wrathful Hagen \r\rspake ; \r" For gallant knight \'twere fitting trial once more to make. \rIf then returned he scatheless, a valiant man he were. \rThe wound doth boot thee little that now from his hand I bear. \r\r2057 \r"That here from wound upon me my mail-coat see\'st thou red, \rShall bring woful reprisal on many a warrior\'s head. \rNow is my wrath aroused in full \'gainst Hawart\'s thane. \rAs yet in sooth hath Iring wrought on me but little bane." \r\r2058 \rIring then of Denmark stood where fanned the wind. \rHe cooled him in his armor and did his helm unbind. \rThen praised him all the peopple and spoke him man of might, \rWhereat the margrave\'s bosom swelled full high with proud \rdelight. \r\r\r\rHOW IRING WAS SLAIN 303 \r\r\r\r2059 \r"Now hearken friends unto me," Iring once more spake; \r"Make me straightway ready, new trial now to make \rIf I this knight so haughty may yet perchance subdue." \rNew shield they brought, for Hagen did his erstwhile asunder hew. \r\r2060 \rSoon stood again the warrior in armor all bedight. \rIn hand a spear full massy took the wrathful knight, \rWherewith on yonder Hagen he thought to vent his hate. \rWith grim and fearful visage on him the vengeful thane did wait. \r\r2061 \rYet not abide his coming might Hagen longer now. \rAdown he rushed upon him with many a thrust and blow, \rDown where the stairway ended for fierce did burn his ire. \rSoon the might of Iring must \'neath his furious onset tire. \r\r2062 \rTheir shields they smote asunder that the sparks began \rTo fly in ruddy showers. Hawart\'s gallant man \rWas by sword of Hagen wounded all so sore \r\rThrough shield and shining cuirass, that whole he found him \rnever more. \r\r2063 \rWhen how great the wound was Iring fully knew, \rBetter to guard his helm-band his shield he higher drew. \rThe scathe he first received he deemed sufficient quite, \rYet injury far greater soon had he from King Gunther\'s knight. \r\r2064 \rFrom where it lay before him Hagen a spear did lift \rAnd hurled it upon Iring with aim so sure and swift, \rIt pierced his head, and firmly fixed the shaft did stand; \rFull grim the end that met him \'neath the doughty Hagen\'s hand. \r\r2065 \rBackward Iring yielded unto his Danish men. \rEre for the knight his helmet they undid again, \rFrom his head they drew the spear-point; to death he was anigh. \rWept thereat his kinsmen, and sore need had verily. \r\r\r\r3 o4 THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE \r\r2066 \rCame thereto Queen Kriemhild and o\'er the warrior bent, \rAnd for the doughty Iring gan she there lament. \rShe wept to see him wounded, and sorely grieved the queen. \rThen spake unto his kinsmen the warrior full brave and keen. \r\r2067 \r"I pray thee leave thy moaning, royal high lady. \rWhat avails thy weeping? Yea, soon must ended be \rMy life from wounds outflowing that here I did receive. \rTo serve thyself and Etzel will death not longer grant me leave." \r\r2068 \rEke spake he to them of Thuringia and to them of Danish land: \r"Of you shall never any receive the gift in hand \rFrom your royal mistress of shining gold full red. \rWhoe\'er withstandeth Hagen death calleth down upon his head." \r\r2069 \rFrom cheek the color faded, death\'s sure token wore \rIring the gallant warrior: thereat they grieved full sore. \rNor more in life might tarry Hawart\'s valiant knight: \rEnraged the men of Denmark again did arm them for the fight. \r\r2070 \rIrnfried and Hawart before the hall then sprang \rLeading thousand warriors. Full furious a clang \rOf weapons then on all sides loud and great ye hear. \rAgainst the men of Burgundy how hurled they many a mighty spear ! \r\r2071 \rStraight the valiant Irnfried the minstrel rushed upon, \rBut naught but grievous injury \'neath his hand he won: \rFor the noble Fiddler did the landgrave smite \rE\'en through the well-wrought helmet; yea, grim and savage was \r\rthe knight. \r\r2072 \rSir Irnfried then in answer the valiant minstrel smote, \rThat must fly asunder the rings of his mailed coat \rWhich showered o\'er his cuirass like sparks of fire red. \rSoon must yet the landgrave fall before the Fiddler dead. \r\r\r\r, HOW IRING WAS SLAIN 305 \r\r2073 \rEke were come together Hawart and Hagen bold, \rAnd saw he deeds of wonder who did the sight behold. \rSwift flew the sword and fiercely swung by each hero\'s hand. \rBut soon lay Hawart prostrate before him of Burgundian land. \r\r2074 \rWhen Danish men and Thuringians beheld their masters fall, \rFearful was the turmoil that rose before the hall \rAs to the door they struggled, on dire vengeance bent. \rFull many a shield and helmet was there \'neath sword asunder rent. \r\r2075 \r"Now backward yield," cried Volker "and let them pass within; \rThus only are they thwarted of what they think to win. \rWhen but they pass the portals are they full quickly slain. \rWith death shall they the bounty of their royal mistress gain." \r\r2076 \rWhen thus with pride o\'erweening they did entrance find, \rThe head of many a warrior was so to earth inclined, \rThat he must life surrender \'neath blows that thickly fell. \rWell bore him valiant Gemot and eke Sir Giselher as well. \r\r2077 \rFour knights beyond a thousand were come into the house; \rThe fight from sword-blades glinted, swift swung with mighty souse. \rNot one of all their number soon might ye living see; \rTell might ye mickle wonders of the men of Burgundy. \r\r2078 \rThereafter came a stillness, and ceased the tumult loud. \rThe blood in every quarter through the leak-holes flowed, \rAnd out along the corbels from men in death laid low. \rThat had the men of Rhineland wrought with many a doughty blow. \r\r2079 \rThen sat again to rest them they of Burgundian land, \rShield and mighty broadsword they laid from out the hand. \rBut yet the valiant Fiddler stood waiting \'fore the door, \rIf peradventure any would seek to offer combat more. \r\r\r\r3 o6 THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2080 \rSorely did King Etzel and eke his spouse lament, \rMaidens and fair ladies did sorrow sore torment. \rDeath long since upon them, I ween, such ending swore. \rTo fall before the strangers was doomed full many a warrior more. \r\r\r\rTHIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r\xc2\xa5fcow tbe (Slueen babe set fire to tbe "fcall \r\r2081 \r"Now lay ye off the helmets," the words from Hagen fell: \r"I with a boon companion will be your sentinel. \rAnd seek the men of Etzel to work us further harm, \rFor my royal masters full quickly will I cry alarm." \r\r2082 \rThen freed his head of armor many a warrior good. \rThey sate them on the corses, that round them in the blood \rOf wounds themselves had dealt them, prostrate weltering lay. \rNow to his guests so lofty scant courtesy did Etzel pay. \r\r2083 \rEre yet was come the even, King Etzel did persuade, \rAnd eke the Lady Kriemhild, that once more essayed \rThe Hunnish knights to storm them. Before them might ye see \rGood twenty thousand warriors, who soon for fight must ready be. \r\r2084 \rThen with a furious onset the strangers they attacked. \rDankwart, Hagen\'s brother, who naught of courage lacked, \rSprang out \'mid the besiegers to ward them from the door. \r\'Twas deemed a deadly peril, yet scatheless stood he there before. \r\r2085 \rFierce the struggle lasted till darkness brought an end. \rThemselves like goodly heroes the strangers did defend \rAgainst the men of Etzel all the long summer day. \rWhat host of valiant warriors before them fell to death a prey! \r\r\r\r\r\r\rHOW THE QUEEN BADE SET FIRE TO THE HALL 307 \r\r2086 \rAt turn of sun in summer that havoc sore was wrought, \rWhen the Lady Kriemhild revenge so dire sought \rUpon her nearest kinsmen and many a knight beside, \rWherefore with royal Etzel never more might joy abide. \r\r2087 \rAs day at last was ending sad they were of heart. \rThey deemed from life \'twere better in sudden death to part \rThan be thus long tormented by great o\'erhanging dread. \rThat respite now be granted, the knights so proud and gallant \rprayed. \r\r2088 \rThey prayed to lead the monarch hither to them there. \rAs heroes blood-bespotted, and stained from battle-gear, \rForth from the hall emerged the lofty monarchs three. \rThey wist not to whom complained might their full grievous sor- \rrows be. \r\r2089 \rEtzel and Kriemhild they soon before them found, \rAnd great was now their company from all their lands around. \rSpake Etzel to the strangers: "What will ye now of me? \rYe hope for end of conflict, but hardly may such favor be. \r\r2090 \r"This so mighty ruin that ye on me have wrought, \rIf death thwart not my purpose, shall profit you in naught. \rFor child that here ye slew me and kinsmen dear to me, \rShall peace and reconcilement from you withheld forever be." \r\r2091 \rThereto gave answer Gunther: "To that drove sorest need. \rLay all my train of squires before thy warriors dead \rWhere they for night assembled. How bore I so great blame? \rOf friendly mind I deemed thee, as trusting in thy faith I came." \r\r2092 \rThen spake eke of Burgundy the youthful Giselher: \r"Ye knights that still are living of Etzel, now declare \rWhereof ye may reproach me! How hath you harmed my hand? \rFor in right friendly manner came I riding to this land." \r\r\r\r3 o8 THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2093 \rCried they: "Well is thy friendship in burgh and country known \rBy sorrow of thy making. Gladly had we foregone \rThe pleasure of thy coming from Worms across the Rhine. \rOur country hast thou orphaned, thou and brother eke of thine." \r\r2094 \rIn angry mood King Gunther unto them replied: \r"An ye this mighty hatred appeased would lay aside, \rBorne \'gainst us knights here homeless, to both a gain it were \rFor Etzel\'s wrath against us we in sooth no guilt do bear." \r\r2095 \rThe host then to the strangers: "Your sorrow here and mine \rAre things all unequal. For now must I repine \rWith honor all bespotted and \'neath distress of woe. \rOf you shall never any hence from my country living go." \r\r2096 \rThen did the doughty Gemot unto King Etzel say: \r" God then in mercy move thee to act in friendly way. \rSlay us knights here homeless, yet grant us down to go \rTo meet thee in the open: thine honor biddeth thus to do. \r\r2097 \r"Whate\'er shall be our portion, let that straightway appear. \rMen hast thou yet so many that, should they banish fear, \rNot one of us storm-weary might keep his life secure. \rHow long shall we here friendless this woeful travail yet endure?" \r\r2098 \rBy the warriors of Etzel their wish nigh granted was, \rAnd leave well nigh was given that from the hall they pass. \rWhen Kriemhild knew their purpose, high her anger swelled, \rAnd straightway such a respite was from the stranger knights \rwithheld. \r\r2099 \r"But nay, ye Hunnish warriors! what ye have mind to do, \rTherefrom now desist ye, \xc3\x91such is my counsel true; \rNor let foes so vengeful pass without the hall, \rElse must in death before them full many of your kinsmen fall. \r\r\r\rHOW THE QUEEN BADE SET FIRE TO THE HALL 309 \r\r2100 \r"If of them lived none other but Ute\'s sons alone, \rMy three noble brothers, and they the air had won \rWhere breeze might cool their armor, to death ye were a prey. \rIn all this world were never born more valiant thanes than they." \r\r2101 \rThen spake the youthful Giselher: "Full beauteous sister mine, \rWhen to this land thou bad\'st me from far beside the Rhine, \rI little deemed such trouble did here upon me wait. \rWhereby have I deserved from the Huns such mortal hate? \r\r2102 \r"To thee I ever faithful was, nor wronged thee e\'er. \rIn such faith confiding did I hither fare, \rThat thou to me wert gracious, O noble sister mine. \rShow mercy now unto us, we must to thee our lives resign." \r\r2103 \r"No mercy may I show you, \xc3\x91 unmerciful I\'ll be. \rBy Hagen, knight of Tronje, was wrought such woe to me, \rThat ne\'er is reconcilement the while that I have life. \rThat must ye all atone for," \xc3\x91 quoth the royal Etzel\'s wife. \r\r2104 \r"Will ye but Hagen only to me as hostage give, \rThen will I not deny you to let you longer live. \rBorn are ye of one mother and brothers unto me, \rSo wish I that compounded here with these warriors peace may be." \r\r2105 \r"God in heaven forfend it," Gemot straightway said; \r"E\'en though we were a thousand, lay we all rather dead, \rWe who are thy kinsmen, ere that warrior one \rHere we gave for hostage. Never may such thing be done." \r\r2106 \r"Die must we all," quoth Giselher, "for such is mortal\'s end. \rTill then despite of any, our knighthood we\'ll defend. \rWould any test our mettle, here may he trial make. \rFor ne\'er, when help he needed, did I a faithful friend forsake," \r\r\r\r310 THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r2107 \rThen spake the valiant Dankwart, a knight that knew no fear: \r"In sooth stands not unaided my brother Hagen here. \rWho here have peace denied us may yet have cause to rue. \rI would that this ye doubt not, for verily I tell you true." \r\r2108 \rThe queen to those around her: "Ye gallant warriors, go \rNow nigher to the stairway and straight avenge my woe. \rI\'ll ever make requital therefor, as well I may. \rFor his haughty humor will I Hagen full repay. \r\r2109 \r"To pass without the portal let not one at all, \rFor at its four corners I\'ll bid ignite the hall. \rSo will I fullest vengeance take for all my woe." \rStraightway the thanes of Etzel ready stood her hest to do. \r\r2110 \rWho still without were standing were driven soon within \rBy sword and spear upon them, that made a mighty din. \rYet naught might those good warriors from their masters take, \rBy their faith would never each the other\'s side forsake. \r\r2111 \rTo burn the hall commanded Etzel\'s wife in ire, \rAnd tortured they those warriors there with flaming fire; \rFull soon with wind upon it the house in flames was seen. \rTo any folk did never sadder plight befall, I ween. \r\r2112 \rTheir cries within resounded: "Alack for sorest need! \rHow mickle rather lay we in storm of battle dead. \r\'Fore God \'tis cause for pity, for here we all must die! \rNow doth the queen upon us vengeance wreak full grievously." \r\r2113 \rAmong them spake another: "Our lives we here must end. \rWhat now avails the greeting the king to us did send? \rSo sore this heat oppresseth and parched with thirst my tongue, \rMy fife from very anguish I ween I must resign ere long." \r\r\r\rHOW THE QUEEN BADE SET FIRE TO THE HALL 311 \r\r2114 \rThen quoth of Tronje Hagen: "Ye noble knights and good, \rWhoe\'er by thirst is troubled, here let him drink the blood. \rThan wine more potent is it where such high heat doth rage, \rNor may we at this season find us a better beverage." \r\r2115 \rWhere fallen knight was lying, thither a warrior went. \rAside he laid his helmet, to gaping wound he bent, \rAnd soon was seen a-quamng therefrom the flowing blood. \rTo him though all unwonted, yet seemed he there such drinking \rgood. \r\r2116 \r"Now God reward thee, Hagen," the weary warrior said, \r"That I so well have drunken, thus by thy teaching led. \rBetter wine full seldom hath been poured for me, \rAnd live I yet a season I\'ll ever faithful prove to thee." \r\r2117 \rWhen there did hear the others how to him it seemed good, \rMany more beheld ye eke that drank the blood. \rEach thereby new vigor for his body won, \rAnd eke for lover fallen wept many a buxom dame anon. \r\r2118 \rThe flaming brands fell thickly upon them in the hall, \rWith upraised shields they kept them yet scatheless from their fall, \rThough smoke and heat together wrought them anguish sore. \rBeset were heroes never, I ween, by so great woe before. \r\r2110 \rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "Stand nigh unto the wall, \rLet not the brands all flaming upon your helmets fall. \rInto the blood beneath you tread them with your feet. \rIn sooth in evil fashion us doth our royal hostess greet." \r\r2120 \rIn trials thus endured ebbed the night away. \rStill without the portal did the keen Fiddler stay \rAnd Hagen his good fellow, o\'er shield their bodies leant; \rThey deemed the men of Etzel still on further mischief bent, \r\r\r\r3 i2 THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE \r\r2121 \r\rThen was heard the Fiddler: "Pass we into the hall, \r\rFor so the Huns shall fondly deem we are perished all \r\rAmid the mickle torture we suffer at their hand. \r\rNatheless shall they behold us boun for fight before them stand." \r\r2122 \r\rSpake then of Burgundy the young Sir Giselher: \r\r" I ween \'twill soon be dawning, for blows a cooler air. \r\rTo live in fuller joyance now grant us God in heaven. \r\rTo us dire entertainment my sister Kriemhild here hath given." \r\r2123 \rSpake again another: "Lo! how I feel the day. \rFor that no better fortune here await us may, \rSo don, ye knights, your armor, and guard ye well your life. \rFull soon, in sooth, we suffer again at hands of Etzel\'s wife." \r\r2124 \rFondly Etzel fancied the strangers all were dead, \rFrom sore stress of battle and from the fire dread; \rYet within were living six hundred men so brave, \rThat never thanes more worthy a monarch for liegemen might have. \r\r2125 \rThe watchers set to watch them soon full well had seen \rHow still lived the strangers, spite what wrought had been \rOf harm and grievous evil, on the monarchs and their band. \rWithin the hall they saw them still unscathed and dauntless stand. \r\r2126 \rTold \'twas then to Kriemhild how they from harm were free. \rWhereat the royal lady quoth, such thing ne\'er might be \rThat any still were living from that fire dread. \r"Nay, believe I rather that within they all He dead." \r\r2127 \rGladly yet the strangers would a truce compound, \rMight any grace to offer amid their foes be found. \rBut such appeared not any in them of Hunnish land. \rWell to avenge their dying prepared they then with willing hand. \r\r\r\rHOW THE QUEEN BADE SET FIRE TO THE HALL 313 \r\r\r\r2128 \rAbout the dawn of morning greeted they were again \rWith a vicious onslaught, that paid full many a thane. \rThere was flung upon them many a mighty spear, \rWhile gallantly did guard them the lofty thanes that knew not fear. \r\r2129 \rThe warriors of Etzel were all of eager mood, \rAnd Kriemhild\'s promised bounty win for himself each would; \rTo do the king\'s high bidding did likewise urge their mind. \r\'Twas cause full soon that many were doomed swift death in fight to \rfind. \r\r2130 \rOf store of bounty promised might wonders great be told, \rShe bade on shields to carry forth the ruddy gold, \rAnd gave to him that wished it or would but take her store; \rIn sooth a greater hire ne\'er tempted \'gainst the foe before. \r\r2131 \rA mickle host of warriors went forth in battle-gear. \rThen quoth the valiant Volker: " Still may ye find us here. \rNe\'er saw I move to battle warriors more fain, \rThat to work us evil the bounty of the king have ta\'en." \r\r2132 \rThen cried among them many: "Hither, ye knights, more nigh! \rSince all at last must perish, \'twere better instantly; \rAnd here no warrior falleth but who fore-doomed hath been." \rWith well-flung spears all bristling full quickly then their shields \rwere seen. \r\r2133 \rWhat need of further story? Twelve hundred stalwart men, \rRepulsed in onset gory, still returned again; \rBut dealing wounds around them the strangers cooled their mood, \rAnd there stood all unvanquished. Flowing might ye see the blood \r\r2134 \rFrom deep wounds and mortal, whereof were many slain. \rFor friends in battle fallen heard ye loud complain; \rSlain were all those warriors that served the mighty king, \rWhereat from loving kinsmen arose a mickle sorrowing. \r\r\r\r3 i4 THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\rTHIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r1bow tbe /flbargrave TRueDlger was Slain \r\r2135 \rAt morning light the strangers had wrought high deed of fame, \rWhen the spouse of Gotelinde unto the courtyard came. \rTo behold on both sides such woe befallen there, \rMight not refrain from weeping sorely the faithful Ruediger. \r\r2136 \r"O woe is me!" exclaimed he, " that ever I was born. \rAlack that this great sorrow no hand from us may turn! \rThough I be ne\'er so willing, the king no peace will know, \rFor he beholds his sorrow ever great and greater grow." \r\r2137 \rThen did the kindly Ruediger unto Dietrich send, \rIf to the lofty monarchs they yet might truce extend. \rThe knight of Bern gave message: "How might such thing be? \rFor ne\'er the royal Etzel granteth to end it peacefully." \r\r2138 \rWhen a Hunnish warrior saw standing Ruediger \rAs from eyes sore weeping fell full many a tear, \rTo his royal mistress spake he: " Behold how stands he there \rWith whom here by Etzel none other may in might compare, \r\r2139 \r"And who commandeth service of lands and people all. \rHow many lordly castles Ruediger his own doth call, \rThat unto him hath given the bounty of the king! \rNot yet in valorous conflict saw\'st thou here his sword to swing. \r\r2140 \r"Methinks, but little recks he, what may here betide, \rSince now in fullest measure his heart is satisfied. \r\'Tis told he is, surpassing all men, forsooth, so keen, \rBut in this time of trials his valor ill-displayed hath been." \r\r\r\rHOW THE MARGRAVE RUEDIGER WAS SLAIN 315 \r\r2141 \r\rStood there full of sorrow the brave and faithful man, \r\rYet whom he thus heard speaking he cast his eyes upon. \r\rThought he: "Thou mak\'st atonement, who deem\'st my mettle \r\rcold. \r\rThy thought here all too loudly hast thou unto the people told," \r\r2142 \r\rHis fist thereat he doubled and upon him ran, \r\rAnd smote with blow so mighty there King Etzel\'s man \r\rThat prone before him straightway fell that mocker dead. \r\rSo came but greater sorrow on the royal Etzel\'s head. \r\r2143 \r"Hence thou basest caitiff," cried then Ruediger; \r\r"Here of pain and sorrow enough I have to bear. \r\rWherefore wilt thou taunt me that I the combat shun? \r\rIn sooth had I the utmost of harm upon the strangers done, \r\r2144 \r\r"For that good reason have I to bear them hate indeed, \r\rBut that myself the warriors as friends did hither lead. \r\rYea, was I their safe escort into my master\'s land; \r\rSo may I, man most wretched, ne\'er raise against them hostile \r\rhand." \r\r2145 \rThen spake the lofty Etzel unto the margrave: \r"What aid, O noble Ruediger, here at thy hands we have! \rOur country hath so many already doomed to die, \rWe need not any other: now hast thou wrought full wrongfully." \r\r2146 \rReturned the knight so noble: "My heart he sore hath grieved, \rAnd reproached me for high honors at thy hand received \rAnd eke for gifts unto me by thee so freely made; \rDearly for his slander hath the base traducer paid." \r\r2147 \rWhen had the queen come hither and had likewise seen \rHow on the Hunnish warrior his wrath had vented been, \rIncontinent she mourned it, and tears bedimmed her sight. \rSpake she unto Ruediger: "How dost thou now our love requite, \r\r\r\r3 i6 THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r2148 \r"That for me and thy master thou bring\'st increase of woe? \rNow hast thou, noble Ruediger, ever told us so, \rHow that thou life and honor for our sake wouldst dare. \rEke heard I thanes full many proclaim thee knight beyond compare. \r\r2149 \r"Of the oath I now remind thee that thou to me didst swear, \rWhen counsel first thou gavest to Etzel\'s land to fare, \rThat thou wouldst truly serve me till one of us were dead: \rOf that I wretched woman never stood so sore in need." \r\r2150 \r"Nor do I, royal mistress, deny that so I sware \rThat I for thy well-being would fife and honor dare: \rBut eke my soul to forfeit, \xc3\x91that sware I not indeed. \r\'Tis I thy royal brothers hither to this land did lead." \r\r2151 \rQuoth she: "Bethink thee, Ruediger, of thy fidelity \rAnd oath once firmly plighted that aught of harm to me \rShould ever be avenged, and righted every ill." \rReplied thereto the margrave: "Ne\'er have I failed to work thy \r\rwill." \r\r2152 \rEtzel the mighty monarch to implore him then began, \rAnd king and queen together down knelt before their man, \rWhereat the good margrave was seen in sorest plight, \rAnd gan to mourn his station in piteous words the faithful knight. \r\r2153 \r"O woe is me most wretched," he sorrow-stricken cried, \r"That forced I am my honor thus to set aside, \rAnd bonds of faith and friendship God hath imposed on me. \r\rThou that ruPst in heaven! come death, I cannot yet be free. \r\r2154 \r"Whate\'er it be my effort to do or leave undone, \r\r1 break both faith and honor in doing either one; \rBut leave I both, all people will cry me worthy scorn. \r\rMay He look down in mercy who bade me wretched man be born !" \r\r\r\rHOW THE MARGRAVE RUEDIGER WAS SLAIN 317 \r\r2155 \rWith many a prayer besought him the king and eke his spouse, \r\rWherefore was many a warrior soon doomed his life to lose \r\rAt hand of noble Ruediger, when eke did die the thane. \r\rNow hear ye how he bore him, though filled his heart with sorest \r\rpain. \r\r2156 \r\rHe knew how scathe did wait him and boundless sorrowing, \r\rAnd gladly had refused to obey the king \r\rAnd eke his royal mistress. Full sorely did he fear, \r\rThat if one stranger slew he, the scorn of all the world he\'d bear. \r\r2157 \rThen spake unto the monarch the full gallant thane: \r\r"O royal sire, whatever thou gavest, take again, \r\rThe land and every castle, that naught remain to me. \r\rOn foot a lonely pilgrim I\'ll wander to a far country." \r\r2158 \rThereto replied King Etzel: "Who then gave help to me? \rMy land and lordly castles give I all to thee, \rIf on my foes, O Ruediger, revenge thou wilt provide. \rA mighty monarch seated, shalt thou be by Etzel\'s side." \r\r2159 \rAgain gave answer Ruediger: "How may that ever be? \r\rAt my own home shared they my hospitality. \r\rMeat and drink I offered to them in friendly way, \r\rAnd gave them of my bounty: how shall I seek them here to slay? \r\r2160 \r"The folk belike will fancy that I a coward be. \rNe\'er hath faithful service been refused by me \rUnto the noble princes and their warriors too; \rThat e\'er I gained their friendship, now \'tis cause for me to rue. \r\r2161 \r"For spouse unto Sir Giselher gave I a daughter mine, \rNor into fairer keeping might I her resign, \rWhere truth were sought and honor and gentle courtesy: \rNe\'er saw I thane so youthful virtuous in mind as he." \r\r\r\r3 i8 THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2162 \rAgain gave answer Kriemhild: "O noble Ruediger, \rTo me and royal Etzel in mercy now give ear \rFor sorrows that o\'erwhelm us. Bethink thee, I implore, \rThat monarch never any harbored so evil guests before." \r\r2163 \rSpake in turn the margrave unto the monarch\'s wife: \r"Ruediger requital must make to-day with life \rFor that thou and my master did me so true befriend. \rTherefore must I perish; now must my service find an end. \r\r2164 \r"E\'en this day, well know I, my castles and my land \rMust surely lose their master beneath a stranger\'s hand. \rTo thee my wife and children commend I for thy care, \rAnd with all the lorn ones that wait by Bechelaren\'s towers fair.\' ; \r\r2165 \r"Now God reward thee, Ruediger," thereat King Etzel quoth. \rHe and the queen together, right joyful were they both. \r"To us shall all thy people full commended be; \rEke trow I by my fortune no harm shall here befall to thee." \r\r2166 \rFor their sake he ventured soul and life to lose. \rThereat fell sore to weeping the royal Etzel\' s spouse. \rHe spake: "I must unto you my plighted word fulfil. \rAlack! beloved strangers, whom to assail forbids my will." \r\r2167 \rFrom the king there parting ye saw him, sad of mood, \rAnd passed unto his warriors who at small distance stood. \r"Don straightway now your armor, my warriors all," quoth he. \r"Alas! must I to battle with the valiant knights of Burgundy." \r\r2168 \rThen straightway for their armor did the warriors call. \rA shining helm for this one, for that a shield full tall \rSoon did the nimble squires before them ready hold. \rAnon came saddest tidings unto the stranger warriors bold. \r\r\r\rHOW THE MARGRAVE RUEDIGER WAS SLAIN 319 \r\r\r\r2169 \rWith Ruediger there saw ye five hundred men arrayed, \rAnd noble thanes a dozen that came unto his aid, \rThinking in storm of battle to win them honor high. \rIn sooth but little knew they how death awaited them so nigh. \r\r2170 \rWith helm on head advancing saw ye Sir Ruediger. \rSwords that cut full keenly the margrave\'s men did bear, \rAnd eke in hand each carried a broad shield shining bright. \rBoundless was the Fiddler\'s sorrow to behold the sight. \r\r2171 \rWhen saw the youthful Giselher his bride\'s sire go \rThus with fastened helmet, how might he ever know \rWhat .he .therewith did purrK->se_ Jf \'twere not only g ood ? \rThereat the noble monarchs right joyous might ye see of mood. \r\r2172 \r"I joy for friends so faithful," spake Giselher the thane, \r"As on our journey hither we for ourselves did gain. \rFull great shall be our vantage that I found spouse so dear, \rAnd high my heart rejoiceth that plighted thus to wed we were." \r\r2173 \r"Small cause I see for comfort," thereto the minstrel spake. \r"When saw ye thanes so many come a truce to make \rWith helmet firmly fastened and bearing sword in hand? \rBy scathe to us will Ruediger service do for tower and land." \r\r2174 \rThe while that thus the Fiddler had spoken to the end, \rHis way the noble Ruediger unto the hall did wend. \rHis trusty shield he rested on the ground before his feet, \rYet might he never offer his friends in kindly way to greet. \r\r2175 \rLoudly the noble margrave cried into the hall: \r"Now guard you well, ye valiant Nibelungen all. \rFrom me ye should have profit: now have ye harm from me. \rBut late we plighted friendship : broken now these vows must be." \r\r\r\r3 2o THIRTY-SEVENTH ADV ENTURE \r\r\r\r2176 \rThen quailed to hear such tidings those knights in sore distress, \rFor none there was among them but did joy the less \rThat he would battle with them for whom great love they bore. \rAt hand of foes already had they suffered travail sore. \r\r2177 \r"Now God in heaven forfend it," there King Gunther cried, \r"That from mercy to us thou so wilt turn aside, \rAnd the faithful friendship whereof hope had we. \rI trow in sooth that never may such thing be done by thee. \r\r2178 \r"Desist therefrom I may not," the keen knight made reply, \r"But now must battle with you, for vow thereto gave I. \r"Now guard you, gallant warriors, as fear ye life to lose: \rFrom plighted vow release me will nevermore King Etzel\'s spouse. \r\r2179 \r"Too late thou turnst against us," spake King Gunther there. \r"Now might God requite thee, O noble Ruediger, \rFor the faith and friendship thou didst on us bestow, \rIf thou a heart more kindly even to the end wouldst show. \r\r2180 \r"We\'d ever make requital for all that thou didst give,\xc3\x91 \rI and all my kinsmen, wouldst thou but let us live \xc3\x91 \rFor thy gifts full stately, as faithfully thou here \rTo Etzel\'s land didst lead us: know that, O noble Ruediger. \r\r2181 \r"To me what pleasure were it," Ruediger did say, \r"With full hand of my treasure unto you to weigh \rAnd with a mind right willing as was my hope to do! \rThus might no man reproach me with lack of courtesy to you. \r\r2182 \r"Turn yet, O noble Ruediger " Gemot spake again, \r"For in so gracious manner did never entertain \rAny host the stranger, as we were served by thee; \rAnd live we yet a little, shalt thou weU requited be. \r\r\r\rHOW THE MARGRAVE RUEDIGER WAS SLAIN 321 \r\r2183 \r"O would to God, full noble Gemot," spake Ruediger, \r"That ye were at Rhine river and that dead I were \rWith somewhat saved of honor, since I must be your foe! \rUpon good knights was never wrought by friends more bitter woe." \r\r2184 \r"Now God requite thee, Ruediger," Gemot gave reply, \r"For gifts so fair bestowed. I rue to see thee die, \rFor that in thee shall perish knight of so gentle mind. \rHere thy sword I carry, that gav\'st thou me in friendship kind. \r\r2185 \r"It never yet hath failed me in this our sorest need, \rAnd \'neath its cutting edges many a knight lies dead. \r\'Tis strong and bright of lustre, cunning wrought and well. \rI ween, whate\'er was given by knight it doth in worth excel. \r\r2186 \r"An wilt thou not give over upon us here to fall, \rAnd if one friend thou slayest here yet within this hall, \rWith this same sword thou gavest, I\'ll take from thee thy life. \rI sorrow for thee Ruediger, and eke thy fair and stately wife." \r\r2187 \r"Would God but give, Sir Gemot, that such thing might be, \rThat thou thy will completely here fulfilled mightst see, \rAnd of thy friends not any here his life should lose! \rYea, shalt thou live to comfort both my daughter and my spouse." \r\r2188 \rThen out spake of Burgundy the son of Ute fair: \r"How dost thou so, Sir Ruediger? All that with me are \rTo thee are well disposed. Thou dost an evil thing, \rAnd wilt thine own fair daughter to widowhood too early bring. \r\r2189 \r"If thou with armed warriors wilt thus assail me here, \rIn what unfriendly manner thou makest to appear \rHow that in thee I trusted beyond all men beside, \rWhen thy fairest daughter erstwhile I won to be my bride." \r\r\r\r3 22 THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r2190 \r"Thy good faith remember, O Prince of virtue rare, \rIf God from hence do bring thee," \xc3\x91so spake Ruediger: \r"Forsake thou not the maiden when bereft of me, \rBut rather grant thy goodness be dealt to her more graciously." \r\r2191 \r"That would I do full fairly," spake Giselher again. \r"But if my lofty kinsmen, who yet do here remain, \rBeneath thy hand shall perish, severed then must be \rThe friendship true I cherish eke for thy daughter and for thee." \r\r2192 \r"Then God to us give mercy," the knight full valiant spake. \rTheir shields in hand then took they, as who perforce would mat \rTheir passage to the strangers into Kriemhild\'s hall. \rAdown the stair full loudly did Hagen, knight of Tronje, call: \r\r2193 \r"Tarry yet a little, O noble Ruediger, \r\rFor further would we parley," \xc3\x91thus might ye Hagen hear\xc3\x91 \r"I and my royal masters, as presseth sorest need. \rWhat might it boot to Etzel that we strangers all lay dead. \r\r2194 \r"Great is here my trouble," Hagen did declare; \r"The shield that Lady Gotelinde gave to me to bear \rHath now been hewn asunder by Hun-men in my hand. \rWith friendly thought I bore it hither into Etzel\'s land. \r\r2195 \r"Would that God in heaven might grant in kindliness, \rThat I a shield so trusty did for my own possess \rAs in thy hand thou bearest, O noble Ruediger! \rIn battle-storm then need I never hauberk more to wear." \r\r2196 \r"Full glad I\'d prove my friendship to thee with mine own shield, \rDared I the same to offer before Lady Kriemhild. \rBut take it, natheless, Hagen, and bear it in thy hand. \rWould that thou mightst take it again unto Burgundian land! " \r\r\r\rHOW THE MARGRAVE RUEDIGER WAS SLAIN 323 \r\r2197 \rWhen with mind so willing he offered him his shield, \rSaw ye how eyes full many with scalding tears were filled; \rFor the last gift was it that was offered e\'er \rUnto any warrior by Bechelaren\'s margrave, Ruediger. \r\r2198 \rHow grim soe\'er was Hagen and stern soe\'er of mind, \rThat gift to pity moved him that there the chieftain kind, \rSo near his latest moment, did on him bestow. \rFrom eyes of many another began likewise the tears to flow. \r\r2199 \r"Now God in heaven requite thee, O noble Ruediger! \rLike unto thee none other warrior was there e\'er, \rUnto knights all friendless so bounteously to give. \rGod grant in his mercy thy virtue evermore to live. \r\r2200 \r"Woe\'s me to hear such tiding," Hagen did declare. \r"Such load of grief abiding already do we bear, \rIf we with friends must struggle, to God our plaint must be." \rThereto replied the margrave: \'"Tis cause of sorrow sore to me." \r\r2201 \r"To pay thee for thy favor, O noble Ruediger, \rHowe\'er these lofty warriors themselves against thee bear, \rYet never thee in combat here shall touch my hand, \rE\'en though complete thou slayest them from out Burgundian land." \r\r2202 \rThereat the lofty Ruediger \'fore him did courteous bend. \rOn all sides was lamenting that no man might end \rThese so great heart-sorrows that sorely they must bear. \rThe father of all virtue fell with noble Ruediger. \r\r2203 \rThen eke the minstrel Volker from hall down glancing said: \r"Since Hagen thus, my comrade, peace with thee hath made, \rLasting truce thou likewise receivest from my hand. \rWell hast thou deserved it as r ared we hither to this land. \r\r\r\r3 2 4 THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r2204 \r"Thou, O noble margrave, my messenger shalt be. \rThese arm-bands ruddy golden thy lady gave to me, \rThat here at this high festival I the same should wear. \rNow mayst thyself behold them and of my faith a witness bear." \r\r2205 \r"Would God but grant," spake Ruediger, "who ruleth high in \r\rheaven, \rThat to thee by my lady might further gift be given! \rI\'ll gladly tell thy tidings to spouse full dear to me, \rAn I but live to see her: from doubt thereof thou mayst be free.\' \r\r2206 \rWhen thus his word was given, his shield raised Ruediger. \rNigh to madness driven bode he no longer there, \rBut ran upon the strangers like to a valiant knight. \rMany a blow full rapid smote the margrave in his might. \r\r2207 \rVolker and Hagen made way before the thane, \rAs before had promised to him the warriors twain. \rYet found he by the portal so many a valiant man \rThat Ruediger the combat with mickle boding sore began. \r\r2208 \rGunther and Gemot with murderous intent \rLet him pass the portal, as knights on victory bent. \rBackward yielded Giselher, with sorrow all undone; \rHe hoped to live yet longer, and therefore Ruediger would shun \r\r2209 \rStraight upon their enemies the margrave\'s warriors sprung, \rAnd following their master was seen a valiant throng. \rSwords with cutting edges did they in strong arm wield, \r\'Neath which full many a helmet was cleft, and many a fail \rwrought shield. \r\r2210 \rThe weary strangers likewise smote many a whirring slash, \rWherefrom the men of Bechelaren felt deep and long the gash \rThrough the shining ring-mail e\'en to their life\'s core. \rIn storm of battle wrought they glorious deeds a many more. \r\r\r\rHOW THE MARGRAVE RUEDIGER WAS SLAIN 325 \r\r2211 \rAll his trusty followers now eke had gained the hall, \rOn whom Volker and Hagen did soon in fury fall, \rAnd mercy unto no man save Ruediger they showed. \rThe blood adown through helmets, where smote their swords, full \rplenteous flowed. \r\r2212 \rHow right furiously were swords \'gainst armor driven! \rOn shields the well-wrought mountings from their wards were \r\rriven, \rAnd fell their jewelled facings all scattered in the blood. \rNe\'er again might warriors show in fight so grim a mood. \r\r2213 \rThe lord of Bechelaren through foemen cut his way, \rAs doth each doughty warrior in fight his might display. \rOn that day did Ruediger show full plain that he \rA hero was undaunted, full bold and eke full praiseworthy. \r\r2214 \rStood there two knights right gallant, Gunther and Gemot, \rAnd in the storm of battle to death full many smote. \rEke Giselher and Dankwart, never aught recked they \rHow many a lusty fighter saw \'neath their hand his latest day. \r\r2215 \rFull well did show him Ruediger a knight of mettle true, \rDoughty in goodly armor. What warriors there he slew! \rBeheld it a Burgundian, and cause for wrath was there. \rNot longer now was distant the death of noble Ruediger. \r\r2216 \rGemot, knight full doughty, addressed the margrave then, \rThus speaking to the hero: "Wilt thou of all my men \rLiving leave not any, O noble Ruediger? \rThat gives me grief unmeasured ; the sight I may not longer bear. \r\r2217 \r"Now must thy gift unto me prove thy sorest bane, \rSince of my friends so many thou from me hast ta\'en. \rNow hither turn to front me, thou bold and noble knight: \rAs far as might may bear me I trust to pay thy gift aright." \r\r\r\r326 THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2218 \rEre that full the margrave might make his way to him, \rMust rings of glancing mail-coats with flowing blood grow dim. \rThen sprang upon each other those knights on honor bent, \rAnd each from wounds deep cutting sought to keep him all unshent. \r\r2219 \rTheir swords cut so keenly that might withstand them naught. \rWith mighty arm Sir Ruediger Gemot then smote \rThrough the flint-hard helmet, that downward flowed the blood. \rTherefor repaid him quickly the knight of keen and valiant mood \r\r2220 \rThe gift he had of Ruediger high in hand he swung, \rAnd though to death was wounded he smote with blow so strong \rThat the good shield was cloven and welded helmet through. \rThe spouse of fair Gotelinde, then his latest breath he drew. \r\r2221 \rIn sooth so sad requital found rich bounty ne\'er. \rSlain fell they both together, Gemot and Ruediger, \rAlike in storm of battle, each by the other\'s hand. \rSore was the wrath of Hagen when he the harm did understand \r\r2222 \rCried there the lord of Tronje: "Great is here our loss. \rIn death of these two heroes such scathe befalleth us, \rWherefor land and people shall repine for aye. \rThe warriors of Ruediger must now to us the forfeit pay." \r\r2223 \r"Alack for this my brother, snatched by death this day! \rWhat host of woes unbidden encompass me alway! \rEke must I moan it ever that noble Ruediger fell. \rGreat is the scathe to both sides and great the sorrowing as well.\' \r\r2224 \rWhen then beheld Sir Giselher his lover\'s sire dead, \rMust all that with him followed suffer direst need. ^ \rThere Death was busy seeking to gather in his train, \rAnd of the men of Bechelaren came forth not one alive agam. \r\r\r\rHOW THE MARGRAVE RUEDIGER WAS SLAIN 327 \r\r2225 \rGunther and Giselher and with them Hagen too, \rDankwart and Volker, doughty thanes and true, \rWent where found they lying the two warriors slain, \rNor at the sight the heroes might their grief and tears restrain. \r\r2226 \r"Death robbeth us right sorely," spake young Sir Giselher: \r"Yet now give o\'er your weeping and let us seek the air, \rThat the ringed mail grow cooler on us storm-weary men. \rGod in sooth will grant us not longer here to live, I ween." \r\r2227 \rHere sitting, and there leaning was seen full many a thane, \rResting once more from combat, the while that all lay slain \rThe followers of Ruediger. Hushed was the battle\'s din. \rAt length grew angry Etzel, that stillness was so long within. \r\r2228 \r"Alack for such a service!" spake the monarch\'s wife; \r"For never \'tis so faithful that our foes with life \rMust to us make payment at Ruediger\'s hand. \rHe thinks in sooth to lead them again unto Burgundian land. \r\r2229 \r"What boots it, royal Etzel, that we did ever share \rWith him what he desired? The knight doth evil there. \rHe that should avenge us, the same a truce doth make." \rThereto the stately warrior Volker in answer spake: \r\r2230 \r"Alas \'tis no such case here, O high and royal dame. \rDared I but give the he to one of thy lofty name, \rThou hast in fiendish manner Ruediger belied. \rHe and all his warriors have laid all thoughts of truce aside. \r\r2231 \r"With so good heart obeyed he his royal master\'s will \rThat he and all his followers here in death he still. \rLook now about thee, Kriemhild, who may thy hests attend. \rRuediger the hero hath served thee faithful to the end. \r\r\r\r328 THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2232 \r"Wilt thou my words believe not, to thee shall clear be shown." \rTo cause her heart a sorrow, there the thing was done. \rWound-gashed they bore the hero where him the king might see. \rUnto the thanes of Etzel ne\'er might so great sorrow be. \r\r2233 \rWhen did they the margrave a corse on bier behold, \rBy chronicler might never written be nor told \rAll the wild lamenting of women and of men, \rAs with grief all stricken out-poured they their hearts\' sorrow then. \r\r2234 \rRoyal Etzel\' s sorrow there did know no bound. \rLike to the voice of lion echoing rang the sound \rOf the king\'s loud weeping, wherein the queen had share. \rUnmeasured they lamented the death of noble Ruediger. \r\r\r\rTHIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \rDow all Sic metvicb\'6 Ifcnigbts were Slain \r\r2235 \rOn all sides so great sorrow heard ye there around, \rThat palace and high tower did from the wail resound. \rOf Bern a man of Dietrich eke the same did hear, \rAnd speedily he hastened the tidings to his lord to bear. \r\r2236 \rSpake he unto his master: "Sir Dietrich give me ear. \rWhat yet hath been my fortune, never did I hear \rLamenting past all measure, as at this hour hath been. \rScathe unto King Etzel himself hath happened, I ween. \r\r2237 \r"Else how might they ever all show such dire need? \rThe king himself or Kriemhild, one of them lieth dead, \rBy the doughty strangers for sake of vengeance slain. \rUnmeasured is the weeping of full many a stately thane." \r\r\r\rHOW ALL SIR DIETRICH\'S KNIGHTS WERE SLAIN 329 \r\r\r\r2238 \rThen spake of Bern Sir Dietrich: "Ye men to me full dear, \rNow haste ye not unduly. The deeds performed here \rBy the stranger warriors show sore necessity. \rThat peace with them I flighted, let it now their profit be." \r\r2239 \rThen spake the valiant Wolf hart: "Thither will I run \rTo make question of it what they now have done, \rAnd straight will tidings bring thee, master full dear to me, \rWhen yonder I inform me, whence may so great lamenting be." \r\r2240 \rAnswer gave Sir Dietrich: "Fear they hostility, \rThe while uncivil questioning of their deed there be, \rLightly are stirred to anger good warriors o\'er the thing. \rYea, \'tis my pleasure, Wolfhart, thou sparest them all such question- \ring. \r\r2241 \rHelfrich he then commanded thither with speed to go \rThat from men of Etzel he might truly know, \rOr from the strangers straightway, what thing there had been. \rAs that, so sore lamenting of people ne\'er before was seen. \r\r2242 \rQuestioned then the messenger : \' \' What hath here been wrought ? " \rAnswered one among them: "Complete is come to naught \rWhat of joy we cherished here in Hunnish land. \rSlain here lieth Ruediger, fallen \'neath Burgundian hand. \r\r2243 \r"Of them that entered with him not one doth longer live." \rNaught might ever happen Helfrich more to grieve, \rNor ever told he tidings so ruefully before. \rWeeping sore the message unto Dietrich then he bore. \r\r2244 \r"What the news thou bringst us?" Dietrich spake once more; \r"Yet, O doughty Helfrich, wherefore dost weep so sore?" \rAnswered the noble warrior: "With right may I complain: \rYonder faithful Ruediger lieth by the Burgundians slain." \r\r\r\r33 o THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2245 \rThe lord of Bern gave answer: " God let not such thing be! \rThat were a mighty vengeance, and eke the Devil\'s glee. \rWhereby had ever Ruediger from them deserved such ill? \rWell know I to the strangers was ever well disposed his will." \r\r2246 \rThereto gave answer Wolf hart: "In sooth have they this done, \rTherefor their lives shall forfeit surely, every one. \rAnd make we not requital, our shame for aye it were; \rFull manifold our service from hand of noble Ruediger." \r\r2247 \rThen bade the lord of Amelungen the case more full to learn. \rHe sat within a casement and did full sadly mourn. \rHe prayed then that Hildebrand unto the strangers go, \rThat he from their own telling of the case complete might know. \r\r2248 \rThe warrior keen in battle, Master Hildebrand, \rNeither shield nor weapon bore he in his hand, \rBut would in chivalrous manner unto the strangers go. \rHis sister\'s son reviled him that he would venture thus to do. \r\r2249 \rSpake in anger Wolfhart: "Goest thou all weaponless, \rMust I of such action free my thought confess: \rThou shalt in shameful fashion hither come again; \rGoest thou armed thither, will all from harm to thee refrain." \r\r2250 \rSo armed himself the old man at counsel of the young. \rEre he was ware of it, into their armor sprung \rAll of Dietrich\'s warriors and stood with sword in hand. \rGrieved he was, and gladly had turned them Master Hildebrand. \r\r2251 \rHe asked them whither would they. "Thee company we\'ll bear, \rSo may, perchance, less willing Hagen of Tronje dare, \rAs so oft his custom, to give thee mocking word." \rThe thane his leave did grant them at last when he their speech had \rheard. \r\r\r\rHOW ALL SIR DIETRICH\'S KNIGHTS WERE SLAIN 331 \r\r2252 \rKeen Volker saw approaching, in armor all arrayed, \rOf Bern the gallant warriors that Dietrich\'s word obeyed, \rWith sword at girdle hanging and bearing shield in hand. \rStraight he told the tidings to his masters of Burgundian land. \r\r2253 \rSpake the doughty Fiddler: "Yonder see I come near \rThe warriors of Dietrich all clad in battle gear \rAnd decked their heads with helmets, as if our harm they mean. \rFor us knights here homeless approacheth evil end, I ween." \r\r2254 \rMeanwhile was come anigh them Master Hildebrand. \rBefore his foot he rested the shield he bore in hand, \rAnd soon began to question the men of Gunther there: \r"Alack, ye gallant warriors, what harm hath wrought you Ruediger ? \r\r2255 \r"Me did my master Dietrich hither to you command: \r\rIf now the noble margrave hath fallen \'neath the hand \r\rOf any knight among you, as word to us is borne, \r\rSuch a mighty sorrow might we never cease to mourn." \r\r2256 \rThen spake of Tronje Hagen: "True is the tale ye hear. \rThough glad I were, if to you had lied the messenger, \rAnd if the faithful Ruediger still his life might keep, \rFor whom both man and woman must ever now in sorrow weep!" \r\r2257 \rWhen they for sooth the passing of the hero knew, \r\rThose gallant knights bemoaned him like faithful friends and true; \r\rOn Dietrich\'s lusty warriors saw ye fall the tear \r\rAdown the bearded visage, for sad of heart in truth they were. \r\r2258 \rOf Bern then a chieftain, Siegstab, further cried: \r"Of all the mickle comfort now an end is made, \rThat Ruediger erst prepared us after our days of pain. \rThe joy of exiled people here lieth by you warriors slain." \r\r\r\r33 2 THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2259 \rThen spake of Ameiungen the thane Wolfwein: \r"If that this day beheld I dead e\'en sire of mine, ^ \rNo more might be my sorrow than for this hero\'s life. \rAlack! who bringeth comfort now to the noble margrave\'s wife?" \r\r2260 \rSpake eke in angry humor Wolihart a stalwart thane: \r"Who now shall lead our army on the far campaign, \rAs full oft the margrave of old hath led our host? \rAlack! O noble Ruediger, that in such manner thee we\'ve lost!" \r\r2261 \rWolfbrand and Helfrich and Helmnot with warriors all \rMourned there together that he in death must fall. \rFor sobbing might not further question Hildebrand. \rHe spake : " Now do, ye warriors, according to my lord\'s command. \r\r2262 \r"Yield unto us Ruediger\' s corse from out the hall, \rIn whose death to sorrow hath passed our pleasure all; \rAnd let us do him service for friendship true of yore \rThat e\'er for us he cherished and eke for many a stranger more. \r\r2263 \r"We too from home are exiles like unto Ruediger. \rWhy keep ye us here waiting? Him grant us hence to bear, \rThat e\'en though death hath reft him our service he receive, \rThough fairer had we paid it the while the hero yet did live." \r\r2264 \rThereto spake King Gunther: "No service equal may \rThat which, when death hath reft him, to friend a friend doth pay. \rHim deem I friend right faithful, whoe\'er the same may do. \rWell make ye here requital for many a service unto you." \r\r2265 \r"How long shall we beseech you," spake Wolfhart the thane; \r"Since he that best consoled us by you now lieth slain, \rAnd we, alas, no longer his living aid may have, \rGrant us hence to bear him and lay the hero in his grave." \r\r\r\rHOW ALL SIR DIETRICH\'S KNIGHTS WERE SLAIN 333 \r\r2266 \rThereto answered Volker: "Thy prayer shall all deny. \rFrom out the hall thou take him, where doth the hero lie \r\'Neath deep wounds and mortal in blood now smitten down. \rSo may by thee best service here to Ruediger be shown." \r\r2267 \rAnswered Wolfhart boldly: "Sir Fiddleman, God wot \rThou shalt forbear to stir us, for woe on us thou\'st wrought. \rDurst I despite my master, uncertain were thy life; \rYet must we here keep silence, for he did bid us shun the strife." \r\r2268 \rThen spake again the Fiddler: "\'Tis all too much of fear, \rFor that a thing\'s forbidden, meekly to forbear. \rScarce may I deem it valor worthy good knight to tell." \rWhat said his faithful comrade, did please the doughty Hagen \rwell. \r\r2269 \r"For proof be not o\'er-eager," Wolfhart quick replied, \r"Else so I\'ll tune thy fiddle that when again ye ride \rAfar unto Rhine river, sad tale thou tellest there. \rThy haughty words no longer may I now with honor bear." \r\r2270 \rSpake once more the Fiddler: "If e\'er the harmony \rOf my fiddle-strings thou breakest, thy helmet\'s sheen shall be \rMade full dim of lustre by stroke of this my hand, \rHowe\'er fall out my journey homeward to Burgundian land." \r\r2271 \rThen would he rush upon him but that him did restrain \rHildebrand his uncle who seized him amain. \r"I ween thou would\'st be witless, by youthful rage misled. \rMy master\'s favor had\'st thou evermore thus forfeited." \r\r2272 \r"Let loose the lion, Master, that doth rage so sore. \rIf but my sword may reach him," spake Volker further more, \r"Though he the world entire by his own might had slain, \rI\'ll smite him that an answer never may he chant again." \r\r\r\r334 THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2273 \rThereat with anger straightway the men of Bern were filled. \rWolfhart, thane right valiant, grasped in haste his shield, \rAnd like to a wild lion out before them sped. \rBy friends a goodly number full quickly was he followed. \r\r2274 \rThough by the hall went striding ne\'er so swift the thane, \rO\'ertook him Master Hildebrand ere he the steps might gain, \rFor nowise would he let him be foremost in the fray. \rIn the stranger warriors worthy foemen soon found they. \r\r2275 \rStraight saw ye upon Hagen rush Master Hildebrand, \rAnd sword ye heard give music in each foeman\'s hand. \rSore they were enraged, as ye soon were ware, \rFor from their swinging broadswords whirred the ruddy sparks in \rair. \r\r2276 \rYet soon the twain were parted in the raging fight: \rThe men of Bern so turned it by their dauntless might. \rEre long then was Hildebrand from Hagen turned away, \rWhile that the doughty Wolfhart the valiant Volker sought to slay. \r\r2277 \rUpon the helm the Fiddler he smote with blow so fierce \rThat the sword\'s keen edges unto the frame did pierce. \rWith mighty stroke repaid him the valiant minstrel too, \rAnd so belabored Wolfhart that thick the sparks around him flew. \r\r2278 \rHewing they made the fire from mail-rings scintillate, \rFor each unto the other bore a deadly hate. \rOf Bern the thane Wolfwein at length did part the two \xc3\x91 \rWhich thing might none other than man of mickle prowess do. \r\r2279 \rGunther, knight full gallant, received with ready hand \rThere the stately warriors of Amelungen land. \rEke did young Giselher of many a helmet bright, \rWith blood all red and reeking, cause to grow full dim the light. \r\r\r\rHOW ALL SIR DIETRICH\'S KNIGHTS WERE SLAIN 335 \r\r2280 \rDankwart, Hagen\'s brother, was a warrior grim. \rWhat erstwhile in combat had been* wrought by him \rAgainst the men of Etzel seemed now as toying vain, \rAs fought with naming ire the son of valiant Aldrian. \r\r2281 \rRitschart and Gerbart, Helfrich and Wichart \rHad oft in storm of battle with valor borne their part, \rAs now \'fore men of Gunther they did clear display. \rLikewise saw ye Wolfbrand glorious amid the fray. \r\r2282 \rThere old Master Hildebrand fought as he were wode. \rMany a doughty warrior was stricken in the blood \rBy the sword that swinging in Wolfhart\'s hand was seen. \rThus took dire vengeance for Ruediger those knights full keen. \r\r2283 \rHavoc wrought Sir Siegstab there with might and main. \rHo! in the hurly-burly what helms he cleft in twain \rUpon the crowns of foemen, Dietrich\'s sister\'s son! \rNe\'er in storm of battle had he more feats of valor done. \r\r2284 \rWhen the doughty Volker there aright had seen \rHow many a bloody rivulet was hewn by Siegstab keen \rFrom out the well-wrought mail-rings, the hero\'s ire arose. \rQuick he sprang toward him, Siegstab then his life must lose \r\r2285 \rEre long time was over, \'neath the Fiddler\'s hand, \rWho of his art did give him such share to understand \rThat beneath his broadsword smitten to death he lay. \rOld Hildebrand avenged him as bade his mighty arm alway. \r\r2286 \r"Alack that knight so loved," spake Master Hildebrand, \r"Here should thus lie fallen \'neath Volker\'s hand. \rNow lived his latest hour in sooth this Fiddler hath." \rFilled was the hero Hildebrand straightway with a mighty wrath. \r\r\r\r33 6 THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r2287 \rWith might smote he Volker that severed flew the band \rE\'en to the hall\'s wide limit far on either hand \rFrom shield and eke from helmet borne by the Fiddler keen; \rTherewith the doughty Volker reft of life at last had been. \r\r2288 \rPressed eager to the combat Dietrich\'s warriors true, \rSmiting that the mail-rings afar from harness flew, \rAnd that the broken sword-points soaring aloft ye saw, \rThe while that reeking blood-stains did they from riven helmets \rdraw. \r\r2289 \rThere of Tronje Hagen beheld Volker dead. \rIn that so bloody carnage \'twas far the sorest need \rOf all that did befall him in death of friend and man. \rAlack! for him what venegance Hagen then to wreak began! \r\r2290 \r"Therefrom shall profit never Master Hildebrand. \rSlain hath been here my helper \'neath the warrior\'s hand, \rThe best of feres in battle that fortune ever sent." \rHis shield upraised he higher and hewing through the throng he \r\rwent. \r\r2291 \rNext saw ye Dankwart by doughty Helfrich slain, \rGunther and Giselher did full sorely plain, \rWhen they beheld him fallen where fiercely raged the fray. \rFor his death beforehand dearly did his foemen pay. \r\r2292 \rThe while coursed Wolfhart thither and back again, \rThrough Gunther\' s men before him hewing wide a lane. \rThrice in sooth returning strode he down the hall, \rAnd many a lusty warrior \'neath his doughty hand must fall. \r\r2293 \rSoon the young Sir Giselher cried aloud to him: \r"Alack, that I should ever find such foeman grim! \rSir knight, so bold and noble, now turn thee here to me. \rI trow to end thy coursing, the which will I no longer see." \r\r\r\rHOW ALL SIR DIETRICH\'S KNIGHTS WERE SLAIN 337 \r\r2294 \rTo Giselher then turned him Wolf hart in the fight, \rAnd gaping wounds full many did each the other smite. \rWith such a mighty fury he to the monarch sped \rThat \'neath his feet went flying the blood e\'en high above his head. \r\r2295 \rWith rapid blows and furious the son of Ute fair \rReceived the valiant Wolfhart as came he to him there. \rHow strong soe\'er the thane was, his life must ended be. \rNever king so youthful might bear himself more valiantly. \r\r2296 \rStraight he smote Wolfhart through well-made cuirass, \rThat from the wound all gaping the flowing blood did pass. \rUnto death he wounded Dietrich\'s liegeman true, \rWhich thing in sooth might never any save knight full gallant do. \r\r2297 \rWhen the valiant Wolfhart of the wound was ware, \rHis shield flung he from him and high with hand in air \rRaised he a mighty weapon whose keen edge failed not. \rThrough helmet and through mail-rings Giselher with might he \rsmote. \r\r2298 \rGrimly each the other there to death had done. \rOf Dietrich\'s men no longer lived there ever one. \rWhen old Master Hildebrand Wolfhart\'s fall had seen, \rIn all his fife there never such sorrow him befell, I ween. \r\r2299 \rFallen now were Gunther\'s warriors every one, \rAnd eke the men of Dietrich. Hildebrand the while had gone \rWhere Wolfhart had fallen down in pool of blood. \rIn his arms then clasped he the warrior of dauntless mood. \r\r2300 \rForth from the hall to bear him vainly did he try: \rBut all too great the burden and there he still must he. \rThe dying knight looked upward from his bloody bed \rAnd saw how that full gladly him his uncle thence had led. \r\r\r\r338 THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2301 \rSpake he thus mortal wounded: "Uncle full dear to me, \rNow mayst thou at such season no longer helpful be. \rTo guard thee well from Hagen indeed me seemeth good, \rFor bears he in his bosom a heart in sooth of grimmest mood. \r\r2302 \r"And if for me my kinsmen at my death would mourn, \rUnto the best and nearest by thee be message borne \rThat for me they weep not, \xc3\x91 of that no whit is need. \rAt hand of valiant monarch here lie I gloriously dead. \r\r23\xc2\xa13 \r"Eke my life so dearly within this hall I\'ve soid, \rThat have sore cause for weeping the wives of warriors bold. \rIf any make thee question, then mayst thou freely say \rThat my own hand nigh hundred warriors hath slain to-day." \r\r2304 \rNow was Hagen mindful of the minstrel slain, \rFrom whom the valiant Hildebrand erstwhile his life had ta\'en. \rUnto the Master spake he: "My woes shalt thou repay. \rFull many a warrior gallant thou hast ta\'en from us hence away." \r\r23\xc2\xa15 \rHe smote upon Hildebrand that loud was heard the tone \rOf Balmung resounding that erst did Siegfried own, \rBut Hagen bold did seize it when he the hero slew. \rThe old warrior did guard him, as he was knight of mettle true. \r\r2306 \rDietrich\'s doughty liegeman with broadsword did smite \rThat did cut full sorely, upon Tronje\'s knight; \rYet had the man of Gunther never any harm. \rThrough his cuirass well- jointed Hagen smote with mighty arm. \r\r2307 \rSoon as his wound perceived the aged Hildebrand, \rFeared he more of damage to take from Hagen\'s hand; \rAcross his back full deftly his shield swung Dietrich\'s man, \rAnd wounded deep, the hero in flight \'fore Hagen\'s fury ran. \r\r\r\rHOW ALL SIR DIETRICH\'S KNIGHTS WERE SLAIN 339 \r\r2308 \rNow longer lived not any of all that goodly train \rSave Gunther and Hagen, doughty warriors twain. \rWith blood from wound down streaming fled Master Hildebrand, \rWhom soon in Dietrich\'s presence, saw ye with saddest tidings \rstand. \r\r2309 \rHe found the chieftain sitting with sorrow all distraught, \rYet mickle more of sadness unto him he brought. \rWhen Dietrich saw how Hildebrand cuirass all blood-red wore, \rWith fearful heart he questioned, what the news to him he bore. \r\r2310 \r"Now tell me, Master Hildebrand, how thus wet thou be \rFrom thy life-blood flowing, or who so harmeth thee. \rIn hall against the strangers thou\'st drawn thy sword, I ween. \r\'Twere well my straight denial here by these had honored been." \r\r2311 \rReplied he to his master: "From Hagen cometh all. \rThis deep wound he smote me there within the hall \rWhen I from his fury thought to turn away. \r\'Tis marvel that I living saved me from the fiend this day." \r\r2312 \rThen of Bern spake Dietrich: "Aright hast thou thy share, \rFor thou didst hear me friendship unto these knights declare, \rAnd now the peace hast broken, that I to them did give. \rIf my disgrace it were not, by this hand no longer shouldst thou live." \r\r2 3*3 \r"Now be not, Master Dietrich, so sorely stirred to wrath. \r\rOn me and on my kinsmen is wrought too great a scathe. \r\rThence sought we Ruediger to bear all peacefully, \r\rThe which by men of Gunther to us no whit would granted be." \r\r2314 \r"Ah, woe is me for sorrow! Is Ruediger then dead, \rIn all my need there never such grief hath happened. \rThe noble Gotelinde is cousin fair to me. \rAlack for the poor orphans that there in Bechelaren must be!" \r\r\r\r34 o THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE \r\r23 J 5 \rGrief and anguish filled him o\'er Ruediger thus slain, \rNor might at all the hero the flowing tears restrain. \r"Alack for faithful helper that death from me hath torn. \rKing EtzePs trusty liegeman never may I cease to mourn. \r\r2316 \r"Canst thou, Master Hildebrand, true the tidings say, \rWho might be the warrior that Ruediger did slay?" \r"That did the doughty Gemot with mighty arm," he said: \r"Eke at hand of Ruediger lieth the royal hero dead." \r\r2317 \rSpake he again to Hildebrand: "Now let my warriors know, \rThat straightway they shall arm them, for thither will I go. \rAnd bid to fetch hither my shining mail to me. \rMyself those knights will question of the land of Burgundy." \r\r2318 \r"Who here shall do thee service?" spake Master Hildebrand; \r"All that thou hast yet living, thou seest before thee stand. \rOf all remain I only; the others, they are dead." \rAs was in sooth good reason, filled the tale his soul with dread, \r\r2319 \rFor in his life did never such woe to him befall. \rHe spake: "Hath death so reft me of my warriors all, \rGod hath forsaken Dietrich, ah me, a wretched wight! \rSometime a lofty monarch I was, high throned in wealth and \rmight." \r\r2320 \r"How might it ever happen?" Dietrich spake again, \r"That so worthy heroes here should all be slain \rBy the battle-weary strangers thus beset? \rIll fortune me hath chosen, else death had surely spared them yet. \r\r2321 \r"Since that fate not further to me would respite give, \rThen tell me, of the strangers doth any longer live?" \rAnswered Master Hildebrand: "God wot, never one \rSave Hagen, and beside him Gunther lofty king alone." \r\r\r\rHOW ALL SIR DIETRICH\'S KNIGHTS WERE SLAIN 341 \r\r2322 \r"Alack, O faithful Wolfhart, must I thy death now mourn, \rSoon have I cause to rue me that ever I was born. \rSiegstab and Wolfwein and eke Wolfbrand! \rWho now shall be my helpers in the Amelungen land? \r\r23 2 3 \r" Helfrich, thane full valiant, and is he likewise slain? \r\rFor Gerbart and Wichart when shall I cease to plain? \r\rOf all my life\'s rejoicing is this the latest day. \r\rAlack that die for sorrow never yet a mortal may!" \r\r\r\rTHIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE \rf>ow (Suntber ano Ibagen ano Ikrtembilo were Slain \r\r2324 \rHimself did then Sir Dietrich his armor take in hand, \rTo don the which did help him Master Hildebrand. \rThe doughty chieftain meanwhile must make so loud complain \rThat from high palace^ casement oft came back the sound again. \r\r232? \rNameless his proper humor soon he did regain, \rAnd armed full in anger stood the worthy thane; \rA shield all wrought full firmly took he straight in hand, \rAnd forth they strode together, he and Master Hildebrand. \r\r2326 \rSpake then of Tronje Hagen: "Lo, where doth hither wend \rIn wrath his way Sir Dietrich. \'Tis plain he doth intend \rOn us to wreak sore vengeance for harm befallen here. \rTo-day be full decided who may the prize for valor bear! \r\r2327 \r"Let ne\'er of Bern Sir Dietrich hold him so high of might \rNor deem his arm so doughty and terrible in fight \rThat, will he wreak his anger on us for sorest scathe," \xc3\x91 \rSuch were the words of Hagen, \xc3\x91 "I dare not well withstand his \rwrath." \r\r\r\r342 THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r2328 \rUpon these words defiant left Dietrich Hildebrand, \rAnd to the warriors hither came where both did stand \rWithout before the palace, and leaning respite found. \rHis shield well proved in battle Sir Dietrich lowered to the ground. \r\r2329 \rAddressed to them Sir Dietrich these words of sorrowing: \r"Wherefore hast thou such evil, Gunther mighty king, \rWrought \'gainst me a stranger? What had I done to thee, \rOf my every comfort in such manner reft to be? \r\r2330 \r"Seemed then not sufficient the havoc unto you \rWhen from us the hero Ruediger ye slew, \rThat now from me ye\'ve taken my warriors one and all? \rThrough me did so great sorrow ne\'er to you good knights befall. \r\r2 33i \r"Of your own selves bethink you and what the scathe ye bore, \rThe death of your companions and all your travail sore, \rIf not your hearts, good warriors, thereat do heavy grow. \rThat Ruediger hath fallen, \xc3\x91 ah me! hov^lls my heart with woe! \r\r2332 \r"In all this world to any more sorrow ne\'er befell, \rYet have ye minded little my loss and yours as well. \rWhate\'er I most rejoiced in beneath your hands lies slain; \rYea, for my kinsmen fallen never may I cease to plain." \r\r2333 \r"No guilt lies here upon us," Hagen in answer spake. \r"Unto this hall hither your knights their way did take, \rWith goodly train of warriors full armed for the fight. \rMeseemeth that the story hath not been told to thee aright." \r\r2334 \r"What shall I else believe in? To me told Hildebrand \rHow, when the knights that serve me of Amelungenland \rDid beg the corse of Ruediger to give them from the hall, \rNought offered ye but mockings unto the valiant warriors all." \r\r\r\rGUNTHER AND HAGEN AND KRIEMHILD SLAIN 343 \r\r2 335 \rThen spake the King of Rhineland: "Ruediger to bear away \r\rCame they in company hither; whose corse to them deny \r\rI bade, despiting Etzel, nor with aught malice more, \r\rWhereupon did Wolfhart begin to rage thereat full sore." \r\r2336 \rThen spake of Bern the hero: "\'Twas fated so to be. \rYet Gunther, noble monarch, by thy kingly courtesy \rAmends make for the sorrow thou here on me hast wrought, \rThat so thy knightly honor still unsullied be in aught. \r\r2337 \r"Then yield to me as hostage thyself and eke thy man; \r\rSo will I surely hinder, as with best might I can, \r\rThat any here in Hunland harm unto thee shall do: \r\rHenceforward shalt thou find me ever well disposed and true." \r\r2338 \r"God in heaven forfend it," Hagen spake again, \r"That unto thee should yield them ever warriors twain \rWho in their strength reliant all armed before thee stand, \rAnd yet \'fore foes defiant may freely swing a blade in hand." \r\r2339 \r"So shall ye not," spake Dietrich, "proffered peace forswear, \rGunther and Hagen. Misfortune such I bear \rAt both your hands, \'tis certain ye did but do aright, \rWould ye for so great sorrow now my heart in full requite. \r\r2340 \r"I give you my sure promise and pledge thereto my hand \rThat I will bear you escort home unto your land ; \rWith honors fit I\'ll lead you, thereon my life I set, \rAnd for your sake sore evil suffered at your hands forget." \r\r2341 \r"Ask thou such thing no longer," Hagen then replied. \r"For us \'twere little fitting the tale be bruited wide, \rThat twain of doughty warriors did yield them \'neath thy hand. \rBeside thee is none other now but only Hildebrand." \r\r\r\r3 4 4 THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2342 \rThen answered Master Hildebrand: " The hour may come, God \r\rwot, \rSir Hagen, when thus lightly disdain it thou shalt not \rIf any man such offer of peace shall make to thee. \rWelcome might now my master\'s reconciliation be." \r\r2343 \r"I\'d take in sooth his friendship," Hagen gave reply, \r" Ere that I so basely forth from a hall would fly. \rAs thou hast done but lately, O Master Hildebrand. \rI weened with greater valor couldst thou \'fore a foeman stand." \r\r2344 \rThereto gave answer Hildebrand : " From thee reproach like that ? \rWho was then on shield so idle \'fore the Waskenstein that sat, \rThe while that Spanish Walter friend after friend laid low? \rSuch valor thou in plenty hast in thine own self to show." \r\r2345 \rOutspake then Sir Dietrich: "111 fits it warriors bold \rThat they one another like old wives should scold. \rThee forbid I, Hildebrand, aught to parley more. \rAh me, most sad misfortune weigheth on my heart full sore. \r\r2346 \r"Let me hear, Sir Hagen," Dietrich further spake, \r"What boast ye doughty warriors did there together make, \rWhen that ye saw me hither come with sword in hand? \rThought ye then not singly me in combat to withstand?" \r\r2347 \r"In sooth denieth no one," bold Sir Hagen spake, \r"That of the same with sword-blow I would trial make, \rAn but the sword of Niblung burst not within my hand. \rYea, scorn I that to yield us thus haughtily thou mak\'st demand." \r\r2348 \rWhen Dietrich now perceived how Hagen raged amain, \rRaise his shield full quickly did the doughty thane. \rAs quick upon him Hagen adown the perron sprang, \rAnd the trusty sword of Niblung full loud on Dietrich\'s armor rang. \r\r\r\rGUNTHER AND HAGEN AND KRIEMHILD SLAIN 345 \r\r\r\r2349 \rThen knew full well Sir Dietrich that the warrior keen \rSavage was of humor, and best himself to screen \rSought of Bern the hero from many a murderous blow, \rWhereby the valiant Hagen straightway came he well to know. \r\r2350 \rEke fear he had of Balmung, a strong and trusty blade. \rEach blow meanwhile Sir Dietrich with cunning art repaid, \rTill that he dealt to Hagen a wound both deep and long, \rWhereat give o\'er the struggle must the valiant knight and strong. \r\r235 1 \rBethought him then Sir Dietrich: "Through toil thy strength has \r\rfled, \r\rAnd little honor had I shouldst thou lie before me dead. \r\rSo will I yet make trial if I may not subdue \r\rThee unto me as hostage." Light task \'twas not the same to do. \r\r235 2 \rHis shield down cast he from him and with what strength he found \r\rAbout the knight of Tronje fast his arms he wound. \r\rIn such wise was subdued by him the doughty knight; \r\rGunther the noble monarch did weep to see his sorry plight. \r\r2353 \rBind Hagen then did Dietrich, and led him where did stand \rKriemhild the royal lady, and gave into her hand \rOf all the bravest warrior that* ever weapon bore. \rAfter her mickle sorrow had she merry heart once more. \r\r2354 \rFor joy before Sir Dietrich bent royal Etzel\'s wife: \r"Blessed be thou ever in heart while lasteth life. \rThrough thee is now forgotten all my dire need; \rAn death do not prevent me, from me shall ever be thy meed." \r\r2355 \rThen spake to her Sir Dietrich, "Take not his life away, \rHigh and royal lady, for full will he repay \rThee for the mickle evil on thee have wrought his hands. \rBe it not his misfortune that bound before thee here he stands." \r\r\r\r34 6 THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r\r\r2356 \rThen bade she forth lead Hagen to dungeon keep near by, \rWherein he lay fast bolted and hid from every eye. \rGunther, the noble monarch, with loudest voice did say: \r"The knight of Bern who wrongs me, whither hath he fled away?" \r\r2357 \rMeanwhile back towards him the doughty Dietrich came, \rAnd found the royal Gunther a knight of worthy name. \rEke he might bide longer but down to meet him sprang, \rAnd soon with angry clamor their swords before the palace rang. \r\r2358 \rHow famed soe\'er Sir Dietrich and great the name he bore, \rWith wrath was filled King Gunther, and eke did rage full sore \rAt thought of grievous sorrow suffered at his hand: \rStill tell they as high wonder how Dietrich might his blows with- \rstand. \r\r2359 \rIn store of doughty valor each did nothing lack. \rFrom palace and from tower the din of blows came back \rAs on well-fastened helmets the lusty swords came down, \rAnd royal Gunther\'s valor in the fight full clear was shown. \r\r2360 \rThe knight of Bern yet tamed him as Hagen erst befell, \rAnd oozing through his armor the blood was seen to swell \rFrom cut of sharpest weapon in \xc2\xa9ietrich\'s arm that swung. \rRight worthily King Gunther had borne him after labors long. \r\r2361 \rBound was then the monarch by Sir Dietrich\'s hand, \rAlbeit bonds should suffer ne\'er king of any land. \rBut deemed he, if King Gunther and Hagen yet were free, \rSecure might never any from their searching vengeance be. \r\r2362 \rWhen in such manner Dietrich the king secure had bound \rBy the hand he led him where Kriemhild he found. \rAt sight of his misfortune did sorrow from her flee: \rQuoth she: "Welcome Gunther f r o^ out the land of Burgundy." \r\r\r\rGUNTHER AND HAGEN AND KRIEMHILD SLAIN 347 \r\r2363 \rHe spake: "Then might I thank thee, sister of high degree, \rWhen that some whit more gracious might thy greeting be. \rSo angry art thou minded ever yet, O queen, \rFull spare shall be thy greeting to Hagen and to me, I ween." \r\r2364 \rThen spake of Bern the hero: "Ne\'er till now, O queen, \rGiven o\'er as hostage have knights so worthy been, \rAs I, O lofty lady, in these have given to thee: \rI pray thee higher evils to spare them now for sake of me." \r\r2365 \rShe vowed to do it gladly. Then forth Sir Dietrich went \rWith weeping eyes to see there such knights\' imprisonment. \rIn grimmest ways thereafter wreaked vengeance Etzel\'s wife: \rBeneath her hand those chosen warriors twain must end their life. \r\r2366 \rShe let them lie asunder the less at ease to be, \rNor did each the other thenceforward ever see \rTill that unto Hagen her brother\'s head she bore. \rIn sooth did Kriemhild vengeance wreak upon the twain full sore. \r\r2367 \rForth where she should find Hagen the queen her way did take, \' \rAnd in right angry manner she to the warrior spake: \r"An thou wilt but restore me that thou hast ta\'en from me, \rSo may\'st thou come yet living home to the land of Burgundy." \r\r2368 \rAnswered thereto grim Hagen: "\'Twere well thy breath to save, \rFull high and royal lady. Sworn by my troth I have \rThat I the hoard will tell not; the while that yet doth live \rOf my masters any, the treasure unto none I\'ll give." \r\r2369 \r"Then ended be the story," the noble lady spake. \rShe bade them from her brother straightway his life to take. \rHis head they struck from off him, which by the hair she bore \rUnto the thane of Tronje. Thereat did grieve the knight full sore. \r\r\r\r348 THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE \r\r2370 \rWhen that he in horror his master\'s head had seen, \rCried the doughty warrior unto Kriemhild the queen: \r"Now is thy heart\'s desire at length accomplished. \rAnd eke hath all befallen as my foreboding heart hath said. \r\r2371 \r"Dead lieth now the noble king of Burgundy, \rAlso youthful Giselher and Sir Gemot eke doth he. \rThe treasure no one knoweth but God and me alone, \rNor e\'er by thee, she-devil, shall its hiding-place be known." \r\r2372 \rQuoth she: "But ill requital hast thou made to me. \rYet mine the sword of Siegfried now henceforth shall be, \rThe which when last I saw him, my loved husband bore, \rIn whom on me such sorrow through guilt of thine doth weigh full \r\r\r\rsore." \r\r\r\r55 \r\r\r\r2373 \rShe drew it from the scabbard, nor might he say her nay, \rThough thought she from the warrior his life to take away. \rWith both hands high she raised it and off his head struck she, \rWhereat did grieve King Etzel full sore the sorry sight to see. \r\r2374 \r"To arms!" cried then the monarch: "here lieth foully slain \rBeneath the hand of woman of all the doughtiest thane \rThat e\'er was seen in battle or ever good shield bore! \rThough foeman howsoever, yet grieveth this my heart full sore. \r\r2375 \rQuoth then the aged Hildebrand: "Reap no gain she shall, \rThat thus she dared to slay him. * Whate\'er to me befall. \rAnd though myself in direst need through him have been, \rBy me shall be avenged the death of Tronje\'s knight full keen/\' \r\r2376 \rIn wrathful mood then Hildebrand unto Kriemhild sprung, \rAnd \'gainst the queen full swiftly his massy blade he swung. \rAloud she then in terror \'fore Hildebrand did wail, \rYet that she shrieked so loudly, to save her what might that \ravail ? \r\r\r\rGUNTHER AND HAGEN AND KRIEMHILD SLAIN 349 \r\r2377 \rSo all those warriors fated by hand of death lay strewn, \rAnd e\'en the queen full lofty in pieces eke was hewn. \rDietrich and royal Etzel at length to weep began, \rAnd grievously they mourned kinsmen slain and many a man. \r\r2378 \rWho late stood high in honor now in death lay low, \rAnd fate of all the people weeping was and woe. \rTo mourning now the monarch\'s festal tide had passed, \rAs falls that joy to sorrow turneth ever at the last. \r\r2379 \rNor can I tell you further what later did befall, \r\rBut that good knights and ladies saw ye mourning all, \r\rAnd many a noble squire, for friends in death laid low. \r\rHere hath the story ending, \xc3\x91 that is the Nibelungen woe. \r\r\r\rBINOING SECT.
