unhand me, grey-beard loon!'\rEftsoons his hand dropt he.\r\rHe holds him with his glittering eye\xc3\x91\rThe Wedding-Guest stood still,\rAnd listens like a three years' child:\rThe Mariner hath his will.\r\rThe Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:\rHe cannot choose but hear;\rAnd thus spake on that ancient man,\rThe bright-eyed Mariner.\r\r'The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,\rMerrily did we drop\rBelow the kirk, below the hill,\rBelow the lighthouse top.\r\rThe Sun came up upon the left,\rOut of the sea came he!\rAnd he shone bright, and on the right\rWent down into the sea.\r\rHigher and higher every day,\rTill over the mast at noon\xc3\x91'\rThe Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,\rFor he heard the loud bassoon.\r\rThe bride hath paced into the hall,\rRed as a rose is she;\rNodding their heads before her goes\rThe merry minstrelsy.\r\rThe Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,\rYet he cannot choose but hear;\rAnd thus spake on that ancient man,\rThe bright-eyed Mariner.\r\rAnd now the STORM-BLAST came, and he\rWas tyrannous and strong:\rHe struck with his o'ertaking wings,\rAnd chased us south along.\r\rWith sloping masts and dipping prow,\rAs who pursued with yell and blow\rStill treads the shadow of his foe,\rAnd forward bends his head,\rThe ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,\rAnd southward aye we fled.\r\rAnd now there came both mist and snow,\rAnd it grew wondrous cold:\rAnd ice, mast-high, came floating by,\rAs green as emerald.\r\rAnd through the drifts the snowy clifts\rDid send a dismal sheen:\rNor shapes of men nor beasts we ken\xc3\x91\rThe ice was all between.\r\rThe ice was here, the ice was there,\rThe ice was all around:\rIt cracked and growled, and roared and howled,\rLike noises in a swound!\r\rAt length did cross an Albatross,\rThorough the fog it came;\rAs if it had been a Christian soul,\rWe hailed it in God's name.\r\rIt ate the food it ne'er had eat,\rAnd round and round it flew.\rThe ice did split with a thunder-fit;\rThe helmsman steered us through!\r\rAnd a good south wind sprung up behind;\rThe Albatross did follow,\rAnd every day, for food or play,\rCame to the mariner's hollo!\r\rIn mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,\rIt perched for vespers nine;\rWhiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,\rGlimmered the white Moon-shine.'\r\r'God save thee, ancient Mariner!\rFrom the fiends, that plague thee thus!\xc3\x91\rWhy look'st thou so?'\xc3\x91With my cross-bow\rI shot the ALBATROSS.\r\rPART II\rThe Sun now rose upon the right:\rOut of the sea came he,\rStill hid in mist, and on the left\rWent down into the sea.\r\rAnd the good south wind still blew behind,\rBut no sweet bird did follow,\rNor any day for food or play\rCame to the mariner's hollo!\r\rAnd I had done a hellish thing,\rAnd it would work 'em woe:\rFor all averred, I had killed the bird\rThat made the breeze to blow.\rAh wretch! said they, the bird to slay,\rThat made the breeze to blow!\r\rNor dim nor red, like God's own head,\rThe glorious Sun uprist:\rThen all averred, I had killed the bird\rThat brought the fog and mist.\r'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,\rThat bring the fog and mist.\r\rThe fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,\rThe furrow followed free;\rWe were the first that ever burst\rInto that silent sea.\r\rDown dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,\r'Twas sad as sad could be;\rAnd we did speak only to break\rThe silence of the sea!\r\rAll in a hot and copper sky,\rThe bloody Sun, at noon,\rRight up above the mast did stand,\rNo bigger than the Moon.\r\rDay after day, day after day,\rWe stuck, nor breath nor motion;\rAs idle as a painted ship\rUpon a painted ocean.\r\rWater, water, every where,\rAnd all the boards did shrink;\rWater, water, every where,\rNor any drop to drink.\r\rThe very deep did rot: O Christ!\rThat ever this should be!\rYea, slimy things did crawl with legs\rUpon the slimy sea.\r\rAbout, about, in reel and rout\rThe death-fires danced at night;\rThe water, like a witch's oils,\rBurnt green, and blue and white.\r\rAnd some in dreams assur\xef\xbf\xbdd were\rOf the Spirit that plagued us so;\rNine fathom deep he had followed us\rFrom the land of mist and snow.\r\rAnd every tongue, through utter drought,\rWas withered at the root;\rWe could not speak, no more than if\rWe had been choked with soot.\r\rAh! well a-day! what evil looks\rHad I from old and young!\rInstead of the cross, the Albatross\rAbout my neck was hung.\r\rPART III\rThere passed a weary time. Each throat\rWas parched, and glazed each eye.\rA weary time! a weary time!\rHow glazed each weary eye,\r\rWhen looking westward, I beheld\rA something in the sky.\r\rAt first it seemed a little speck,\rAnd then it seemed a mist;\rIt moved and moved, and took at last\rA certain shape, I wist.\r\rA speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!\rAnd still it neared and neared:\rAs if it dodged a water-sprite,\rIt plunged and tacked and veered.\r\rWith throats unslaked, with black lips baked,\rWe could nor laugh nor wail;\rThrough utter drought all dumb we stood!\rI bit my arm, I sucked the blood,\rAnd cried, A sail! a sail!\r\rWith throats unslaked, with black lips baked,\rAgape they heard me call:\rGramercy! they for joy did grin,\rAnd all at once their breath drew in.\rAs they were drinking all.\r\rSee! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!\rHither to work us weal;\rWithout a breeze, without a tide,\rShe steadies with upright keel!\r\rThe western wave was all a-flame.\rThe day was well nigh done!\rAlmost upon the western wave\rRested the broad bright Sun;\rWhen that strange shape drove suddenly\rBetwixt us and the Sun.\r\rAnd straight the Sun was flecked with bars,\r(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)\rAs if through a dungeon-grate he peered\rWith broad and burning face.\r\rAlas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)\rHow fast she nears and nears!\rAre those\xc3\x8aher\xc3\x8asails that glance in the Sun,\rLike restless gossameres?\r\rAre those her\xc3\x8aribs\xc3\x8athrough which the Sun\rDid peer, as through a grate?\rAnd is that Woman all her crew?\rIs that a DEATH? and are there two?\rIs DEATH that woman's mate?\r\rHer\xc3\x8alips were red,\xc3\x8aher\xc3\x8alooks were free,\rHer locks were yellow as gold:\rHer skin was as white as leprosy,\rThe Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,\rWho thicks man's blood with cold.\r\rThe naked hulk alongside came,\rAnd the twain were casting dice;\r'The game is done! I've won! I've won!'\rQuoth she, and whistles thrice.\r\rThe Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out;\rAt one stride comes the dark;\rWith far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,\rOff shot the spectre-bark.\r\rWe listened and looked sideways up!\rFear at my heart, as at a cup,\rMy life-blood seemed to sip!\rThe stars were dim, and thick the night,\rThe steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;\rFrom the sails the dew did drip\xc3\x91\rTill clomb above the eastern bar\rThe horn\xef\xbf\xbdd Moon, with one bright star\rWithin the nether tip.\r\rOne after one, by the star-dogged Moon,\rToo quick for groan or sigh,\rEach turned his face with a ghastly pang,\rAnd cursed me with his eye.\r\rFour times fifty living men,\r(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)\rWith heavy thump, a lifeless lump,\rThey dropped down one by one.\r\rThe souls did from their bodies fly,\xc3\x91\rThey fled to bliss or woe!\rAnd every soul, it passed me by,\rLike the whizz of my cross-bow!\r\rPART IV\r'I fear thee, ancient Mariner!\rI fear thy skinny hand!\rAnd thou art long, and lank, and brown,\rAs is the ribbed sea-sand.\r\rI fear thee and thy glittering eye,\rAnd thy skinny hand, so brown.'\xc3\x91\rFear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!\rThis body dropt not down.\r\rAlone, alone, all, all alone,\rAlone on a wide wide sea!\rAnd never a saint took pity on\rMy soul in agony.\r\rThe many men, so beautiful!\rAnd they all dead did lie:\rAnd a thousand thousand slimy things\rLived on; and so did I.\r\rI looked upon the rotting sea,\rAnd drew my eyes away;\rI looked upon the rotting deck,\rAnd there the dead men lay.\r\rI looked to heaven, and tried to pray;\rBut or ever a prayer had gusht,\rA wicked whisper came, and made\rMy heart as dry as dust.\r\rI closed my lids, and kept them close,\rAnd the balls like pulses beat;\rFor the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky\rLay dead like a load on my weary eye,\rAnd the dead were at my feet.\r\rThe cold sweat melted from their limbs,\rNor rot nor reek did they:\rThe look with which they looked on me\rHad never passed away.\r\rAn orphan's curse would drag to hell\rA spirit from on high;\rBut oh! more horrible than that\rIs the curse in a dead man's eye!\rSeven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,\rAnd yet I could not die.\r\rThe moving Moon went up the sky,\rAnd no where did abide:\rSoftly she was going up,\rAnd a star or two beside\xc3\x91\r\rHer beams bemocked the sultry main,\rLike April hoar-frost spread;\rBut where the ship's huge shadow lay,\rThe charm\xef\xbf\xbdd water burnt alway\rA still and awful red.\r\rBeyond the shadow of the ship,\rI watched the water-snakes:\rThey moved in tracks of shining white,\rAnd when they reared, the elfish light\rFell off in hoary flakes.\r\rWithin the shadow of the ship\rI watched their rich attire:\rBlue, glossy green, and velvet black,\rThey coiled and swam; and every track\rWas a flash of golden fire.\r\rO happy living things! no tongue\rTheir beauty might declare:\rA spring of love gushed from my heart,\rAnd I blessed them unaware:\rSure my kind saint took pity on me,\rAnd I blessed them unaware.\r\rThe self-same moment I could pray;\rAnd from my neck so free\rThe Albatross fell off, and sank\rLike lead into the sea.\r\rPART V\rOh sleep! it is a gentle thing,\rBeloved from pole to pole!\rTo Mary Queen the praise be given!\rShe sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,\rThat slid into my soul.\r\rThe silly buckets on the deck,\rThat had so long remained,\rI dreamt that they were filled with dew;\rAnd when I awoke, it rained.\r\rMy lips were wet, my throat was cold,\rMy garments all were dank;\rSure I had drunken in my dreams,\rAnd still my body drank.\r\rI moved, and could not feel my limbs:\rI was so light\xc3\x91almost\rI thought that I had died in sleep,\rAnd was a blessed ghost.\r\rAnd soon I heard a roaring wind:\rIt did not come anear;\rBut with its sound it shook the sails,\rThat were so thin and sere.\r\rThe upper air burst into life!\rAnd a hundred fire-flags sheen,\rTo and fro they were hurried about!\rAnd to and fro, and in and out,\rThe wan stars danced between.\r\rAnd the coming wind did roar more loud,\rAnd the sails did sigh like sedge,\rAnd the rain poured down from one black cloud;\rThe Moon was at its edge.\r\rThe thick black cloud was cleft, and still\rThe Moon was at its side:\rLike waters shot from some high crag,\rThe lightning fell with never a jag,\rA river steep and wide.\r\rThe loud wind never reached the ship,\rYet now the ship moved on!\rBeneath the lightning and the Moon\rThe dead men gave a groan.\r\rThey groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,\rNor spake, nor moved their eyes;\rIt had been strange, even in a dream,\rTo have seen those dead men rise.\r\rThe helmsman steered, the ship moved on;\rYet never a breeze up-blew;\rThe mariners all 'gan work the ropes,\rWhere they were wont to do;\rThey raised their limbs like lifeless tools\xc3\x91\rWe were a ghastly crew.\r\rThe body of my brother's son\rStood by me, knee to knee:\rThe body and I pulled at one rope,\rBut he said nought to me.\r\r'I fear thee, ancient Mariner!'\rBe calm, thou Wedding-Guest!\r'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,\rWhich to their corses came again,\rBut a troop of spirits blest:\r\rFor when it dawned\xc3\x91they dropped their arms,\rAnd clustered round the mast;\rSweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,\rAnd from their bodies passed.\r\rAround, around, flew each sweet sound,\rThen darted to the Sun;\rSlowly the sounds came back again,\rNow mixed, now one by one.\r\rSometimes a-dropping from the sky\rI heard the sky-lark sing;\rSometimes all little birds that are,\rHow they seemed to fill the sea and air\rWith their sweet jargoning!\r\rAnd now 'twas like all instruments,\rNow like a lonely flute;\rAnd now it is an angel's song,\rThat makes the heavens be mute.\r\rIt ceased; yet still the sails made on\rA pleasant noise till noon,\rA noise like of a hidden brook\rIn the leafy month of June,\rThat to the sleeping woods all night\rSingeth a quiet tune.\r\rTill noon we quietly sailed on,\rYet never a breeze did breathe:\rSlowly and smoothly went the ship,\rMoved onward from beneath.\r\rUnder the keel nine fathom deep,\rFrom the land of mist and snow,\rThe spirit slid: and it was he\rThat made the ship to go.\rThe sails at noon left off their tune,\rAnd the ship stood still also.\r\rThe Sun, right up above the mast,\rHad fixed her to the ocean:\rBut in a minute she 'gan stir,\rWith a short uneasy motion\xc3\x91\rBackwards and forwards half her length\rWith a short uneasy motion.\r\rThen like a pawing horse let go,\rShe made a sudden bound:\rIt flung the blood into my head,\rAnd I fell down in a swound.\r\rHow long in that same fit I lay,\rI have not to declare;\rBut ere my living life returned,\rI heard and in my soul discerned\rTwo voices in the air.\r\r'Is it he?' quoth one, 'Is this the man?\rBy him who died on cross,\rWith his cruel bow he laid full low\rThe harmless Albatross.\r\rThe spirit who bideth by himself\rIn the land of mist and snow,\rHe loved the bird that loved the man\rWho shot him with his bow.'\r\rThe other was a softer voice,\rAs soft as honey-dew:\rQuoth he, 'The man hath penance done,\rAnd penance more will do.'\r\rPART VI\r\rFirst Voice\r'But tell me, tell me! speak again,\rThy soft response renewing\xc3\x91\rWhat makes that ship drive on so fast?\rWhat is the ocean doing?'\r\rSecond Voice\rStill as a slave before his lord,\rThe ocean hath no blast;\rHis great bright eye most silently\rUp to the Moon is cast\xc3\x91\r\rIf he may know which way to go;\rFor she guides him smooth or grim.\rSee, brother, see! how graciously\rShe looketh down on him.'\r\rFirst Voice\r'But why drives on that ship so fast,\rWithout or wave or wind?'\r\rSecond Voice\r'The air is cut away before,\rAnd closes from behind.\r\rFly, brother, fly! more high, more high!\rOr we shall be belated:\rFor slow and slow that ship will go,\rWhen the Mariner's trance is abated.'\r\rI woke, and we were sailing on\rAs in a gentle weather:\r'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;\rThe dead men stood together.\r\rAll stood together on the deck,\rFor a charnel-dungeon fitter:\rAll fixed on me their stony eyes,\rThat in the Moon did glitter.\r\rThe pang, the curse, with which they died,\rHad never passed away:\rI could not draw my eyes from theirs,\rNor turn them up to pray.\r\rAnd now this spell was snapt: once more\rI viewed the ocean green,\rAnd looked far forth, yet little saw\rOf what had else been seen\xc3\x91\r\rLike one, that on a lonesome road\rDoth walk in fear and dread,\rAnd having once turned round walks on,\rAnd turns no more his head;\rBecause he knows, a frightful fiend\rDoth close behind him tread.\r\rBut soon there breathed a wind on me,\rNor sound nor motion made:\rIts path was not upon the sea,\rIn ripple or in shade.\r\rIt raised my hair, it fanned my cheek\rLike a meadow-gale of spring\xc3\x91\rIt mingled strangely with my fears,\rYet it felt like a welcoming.\r\rSwiftly, swiftly flew the ship,\rYet she sailed softly too:\rSweetly, sweetly blew the breeze\xc3\x91\rOn me alone it blew.\r\rOh! dream of joy! is this indeed\rThe light-house top I see?\rIs this the hill? is this the kirk?\rIs this mine own countree?\r\rWe drifted o'er the harbour-bar,\rAnd I with sobs did pray\xc3\x91\rO let me be awake, my God!\rOr let me sleep alway.\r\rThe harbour-bay was clear as glass,\rSo smoothly it was strewn!\rAnd on the bay the moonlight lay,\rAnd the shadow of the Moon.\r\rThe rock shone bright, the kirk no less,\rThat stands above the rock:\rThe moonlight steeped in silentness\rThe steady weathercock.\r\rAnd the bay was white with silent light,\rTill rising from the same,\rFull many shapes, that shadows were,\rIn crimson colours came.\r\rA little distance from the prow\rThose crimson shadows were:\rI turned my eyes upon the deck\xc3\x91\rOh, Christ! what saw I there!\r\rEach corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,\rAnd, by the holy rood!\rA man all light, a seraph-man,\rOn every corse there stood.\r\rThis seraph-band, each waved his hand:\rIt was a heavenly sight!\rThey stood as signals to the land,\rEach one a lovely light;\r\rThis seraph-band, each waved his hand,\rNo voice did they impart\xc3\x91\rNo voice; but oh! the silence sank\rLike music on my heart.\r\rBut soon I heard the dash of oars,\rI heard the Pilot's cheer;\rMy head was turned perforce away\rAnd I saw a boat appear.\r\rThe Pilot and the Pilot's boy,\rI heard them coming fast:\rDear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy\rThe dead men could not blast.\r\rI saw a third\xc3\x91I heard his voice:\rIt is the Hermit good!\rHe singeth loud his godly hymns\rThat he makes in the wood.\rHe'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away\rThe Albatross's blood.\r\rPART VII\rThis Hermit good lives in that wood\rWhich slopes down to the sea.\rHow loudly his sweet voice he rears!\rHe loves to talk with marineres\rThat come from a far countree.\r\rHe kneels at morn, and noon, and eve\xc3\x91\rHe hath a cushion plump:\rIt is the moss that wholly hides\rThe rotted old oak-stump.\r\rThe skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,\r'Why, this is strange, I trow!\rWhere are those lights so many and fair,\rThat signal made but now?'\r\r'Strange, by my faith!' the Hermit said\xc3\x91\r'And they answered not our cheer!\rThe planks looked warped! and see those sails,\rHow thin they are and sere!\rI never saw aught like to them,\rUnless perchance it were\r\rBrown skeletons of leaves that lag\rMy forest-brook along;\rWhen the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,\rAnd the owlet whoops to the wolf below,\rThat eats the she-wolf's young.'\r\r'Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look\xc3\x91\r(The Pilot made reply)\rI am a-feared'\xc3\x91'Push on, push on!'\rSaid the Hermit cheerily.\r\rThe boat came closer to the ship,\rBut I nor spake nor stirred;\rThe boat came close beneath the ship,\rAnd straight a sound was heard.\r\rUnder the water it rumbled on,\rStill louder and more dread:\rIt reached the ship, it split the bay;\rThe ship went down like lead.\r\rStunned by that loud and dreadful sound,\rWhich sky and ocean smote,\rLike one that hath been seven days drowned\rMy body lay afloat;\rBut swift as dreams, myself I found\rWithin the Pilot's boat.\r\rUpon the whirl, where sank the ship,\rThe boat spun round and round;\rAnd all was still, save that the hill\rWas telling of the sound.\r\rI moved my lips\xc3\x91the Pilot shrieked\rAnd fell down in a fit;\rThe holy Hermit raised his eyes,\rAnd prayed where he did sit.\r\rI took the oars: the Pilot's boy,\rWho now doth crazy go,\rLaughed loud and long, and all the while\rHis eyes went to and fro.\r'Ha! ha!' quoth he, 'full plain I see,\rThe Devil knows how to row.'\r\rAnd now, all in my own countree,\rI stood on the firm land!\rThe Hermit stepped forth from the boat,\rAnd scarcely he could stand.\r\r'O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!'\rThe Hermit crossed his brow.\r'Say quick,' quoth he, 'I bid thee say\xc3\x91\rWhat manner of man art thou?'\r\rForthwith this frame of mine was wrenched\rWith a woful agony,\rWhich forced me to begin my tale;\rAnd then it left me free.\r\r\rSince then, at an uncertain hour,\rThat agony returns:\rAnd till my ghastly tale is told,\rThis heart within me burns.\r\rI pass, like night, from land to land;\rI have strange power of speech;\rThat moment that his face I see,\rI know the man that must hear me:\rTo him my tale I teach.\r\rWhat loud uproar bursts from that door!\rThe wedding-guests are there:\rBut in the garden-bower the bride\rAnd bride-maids singing are:\rAnd hark the little vesper bell,\rWhich biddeth me to prayer!\r\rO Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been\rAlone on a wide wide sea:\rSo lonely 'twas, that God himself\rScarce seem\xef\xbf\xbdd there to be.\r\rO sweeter than the marriage-feast,\r'Tis sweeter far to me,\rTo walk together to the kirk\rWith a goodly company!\xc3\x91\r\rTo walk together to the kirk,\rAnd all together pray,\rWhile each to his great Father bends,\rOld men, and babes, and loving friends\rAnd youths and maidens gay!\r\rFarewell, farewell! but this I tell\rTo thee, thou Wedding-Guest!\rHe prayeth well, who loveth well\rBoth man and bird and beast.\r\rHe prayeth best, who loveth best\rAll things both great and small;\rFor the dear God who loveth us,\rHe made and loveth all.\r\rThe Mariner, whose eye is bright,\rWhose beard with age is hoar,\rIs gone: and now the Wedding-Guest\rTurned from the bridegroom's door.\r\rHe went like one that hath been stunned,\rAnd is of sense forlorn:\rA sadder and a wiser man,\rHe rose the morrow morn.\r\r\n"
