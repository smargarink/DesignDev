M.\rfor\rJohn Starkey\rat the\rMitre\rin\rFleetstreet\r, near\rTemple-Bar\r.\rMDCLXXI\rPARADISE REGAIN'D, A POEM.\rTHE FIRST BOOK.\rI Who e're while the happy Garden sung,\rBy one mans disobedience lost, now sing\rRecover'd\rParadise\rto all mankind,\rBy one mans firm obedience fully tri'd\rThrough all temptation, and the Tempter foil'd\rIn all his wiles, defeated and repuls't,\rAnd\rEden\rrais'd in the wast Wilderness.\rThou Spirit who ledst this glorious Eremite\rInto the Desert, his Victorious Field\rAgainst the Spiritual Foe, and broughtst him thence\rBy proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire,\rAs thou art wont, my prompted Song else mute,\rAnd bear through highth or depth of natures bounds\rWith prosperous wing full summ'd to tell of deeds\rAbove Heroic, though in secret done,\rAnd unrecorded left through many an Age,\rWorthy t'have not remain'd so long unsung.\rNow had the great Proclaimer with a voice\rMore awful then the sound of Trumpet, cri'd\rRepentance, and Heavens Kingdom nigh at hand\rTo all Baptiz'd: to his great Baptism flock'd\rWith aw the Regions round, and with them came\rFrom\rNazareth\rthe Son of\rJoseph\rdeem'd\rTo the flood\rJordan\r, came as then obscure,\rUnmarkt, unknown; but him the Baptist soon\rDescri'd, divinely warn'd, and witness bore\rAs to his worthier, and would have resign'd\rTo him his Heavenly Office, nor was long\rHis witness unconfirm'd: on him baptiz'd\rHeaven open'd, and in likeness of a Dove\rThe Spirit descended, while the Fathers voice\rFrom Heav'n pronounc'd him his beloved Son.\rThat heard the Adversary, who roving still\rAbout the world, at that assembly fam'd\rWould not be last, and with the voice divine\rNigh Thunder-struck, th' exalted man, to whom\rSuch high attest was giv'n, a while survey'd\rWith wonder, then with envy fraught and rage\rFlies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air\rTo Councel summons all his mighty Peers,\rWithin thick Clouds and dark ten-fold involv'd,\rA gloomy Consistory; and them amidst\rWith looks agast and sad he thus bespake.\rO ancient Powers of Air and this wide world,\rFor much more willingly I mention Air,\rThis our old Conquest, then remember Hell\rOur hated habitation; well ye know\rHow many Ages, as the years of men,\rThis Universe we have possest, and rul'd\rIn manner at our will th' affairs of Earth,\rSince\rAdam\rand his facil consort\rEve\rLost\rParadise\rdeceiv'd by me, though since\rWith dread attending when that fatal wound\rShall be inflicted by the Seed of\rEve\rUpon my head, long the decrees of Heav'n\rDelay, for longest time to him is short;\rAnd now too soon for us the circling hours\rThis dreaded time have compast, wherein we\rMust bide the stroak of that long threatn'd wound,\rAt least if so we can, and by the head\rBroken be not intended all our power\rTo be infring'd, our freedom and our being.\rIn this fair Empire won of Earth and Air;\rFor this ill news I bring, the Womans seed\rDestin'd to this, is late of woman born,\rHis birth to our just fear gave no small cause,\rBut his growth now to youths full flowr, displaying\rAll vertue, grace and wisdom to atchieve\rThings highest, greatest, multiplies my fear.\rBefore him a great Prophet, to proclaim\rHis coming, is sent Harbinger, who all\rInvites, and in the Consecrated stream\rPretends to wash off sin, and fit them so\rPurified to receive him pure, or rather\rTo do him honour as their King; all come,\rAnd he himself among them was baptiz'd,\rNot thence to be more pure, but to receive\rThe testimony of Heaven, that who he is\rThenceforth the Nations may not doubt; I saw\rThe Prophet do him reverence, on him rising\rOut of the water, Heav'n above the Clouds\rUnfold her Crystal Dores, thence on his head\rA perfect Dove descend, what e're it meant,\rAnd out of Heav'n the Sov'raign voice I heard,\rThis is my Son belov'd, in him am pleas'd.\rHis Mother then is mortal, but his Sire,\rHe who obtains the Monarchy of Heav'n,\rAnd what will he not do to advance his Son?\rHis first-begot we know, and sore have felt,\rWhen his fierce thunder drove us to the deep;\rWho this is we must learn, for man he seems\rIn all his lineaments, though in his face\rThe glimpses of his Fathers glory shine.\rYe see our danger on the utmost edge\rOf hazard, which admits no long debate,\rBut must with something sudden be oppos'd,\rNot force, but well couch't fraud, well woven snares,\rE're in the head of Nations he appear\rTheir King, their Leader, and Supream on Earth.\rI, when no other durst, sole undertook\rThe dismal expedition to find out\rAnd ruine\rAdam\r, and the exploit perform'd\rSuccessfully; a calmer voyage now\rWill waft me; and the way found prosperous once\rInduces best to hope of like success.\rHe ended, and his words impression left\rOf much amazement to th' infernal Crew,\rDistracted and surpriz'd with deep dismay\rAt these sad tidings; but no time was then\rFor long indulgence to their fears or grief:\rUnanimous they all commit the care\rAnd management of this main enterprize\rTo him their great Dictator, whose attempt\rAt first against mankind so well had thriv'd\rIn\rAdam\r's overthrow, and led thir march\rFrom Hell's deep-vaulted Den to dwell in light,\rRegents and Potentates, and Kings, yea gods\rOf many a pleasant Realm and Province wide.\rSo to the Coast of\rJordan\rhe directs\rHis easie steps; girded with snaky wiles,\rWhere he might likeliest find this new-declar'd,\rThis man of men, attested Son of God,\rTemptation and all guile on him to try;\rSo to subvert whom he suspected rais'd\rTo end his Raign on Earth so long enjoy'd:\rBut contrary unweeting he fulfill'd\rThe purpos'd Counsel pre-ordain'd and fixt\rOf the most High, who in full frequence bright\rOf Angels, thus to\rGabriel\rsmiling spake.\rGabriel\rthis day by proof thou shalt behold,\rThou and all Angels conversant on Earth\rWith man or mens affairs, how I begin\rTo verifie that solemn message late,\rOn which I sent thee to the Virgin pure\rIn\rGalilee\r, that she should bear a Son\rGreat in Renown, and call'd the Son of God;\rThen toldst her doubting how these things could be\rTo her a Virgin, that on her should come\rThe Holy Ghost, and the power of the highest\rO're-shadow her: this man born and now up-grown,\rTo shew him worthy of his birth divine\rAnd high prediction, henceforth I expose\rTo\rSatan\r; let him tempt and now assay\rHis utmost subtilty, because he boasts\rAnd vaunts of his great cunning to the throng\rOf his Apostasie; he might have learnt\rLess over-weening, since he fail'd in\rJob\r,\rWhose constant perseverance overcame\rWhate're his cruel malice could invent.\rHe now shall know I can produce a man\rOf female Seed, far abler to resist\rAll his sollicitations, and at length\rAll his vast force, and drive him back to Hell,\rWinning by Conquest what the first man lost\rBy fallacy surpriz'd. But first I mean\rTo exercise him in the Wilderness,\rThere he shall first lay down the rudiments\rOf his great warfare, e're I send him forth\rTo conquer Sin and Death the two grand foes,\rBy Humiliation and strong Sufferance:\rHis weakness shall o'recome Satanic strength\rAnd all the world, and mass of sinful flesh;\rThat all the Angels and \xc2\xaetherial Powers,\rThey now, and men hereafter may discern,\rFrom what consummate vertue I have chose\rThis perfect Man, by merit call'd my Son,\rTo earn Salvation for the Sons of men.\rSo spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven\rAdmiring stood a space, then into Hymns\rBurst forth, and in Celestial measures mov'd,\rCircling the Throne and Singing, while the hand\rSung with the voice, and this the argument.\rVictory and Triumph to the Son of God\rNow entring his great duel, not of arms,\rBut to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles.\rThe Father knows the Son; therefore secure\rVentures his filial Vertue, though untri'd,\rAgainst whate're may tempt, whate're seduce,\rAllure, or terrifie, or undermine.\rBe frustrate all ye stratagems of Hell,\rAnd devilish machinations come to nought.\rSo they in Heav'n their Odes and Vigils tun'd:\rMean while the Son of God, who yet some days\rLodg'd in\rBethabara\rwhere\rJohn\rbaptiz'd,\rMusing and much revolving in his brest,\rHow best the mighty work he might begin\rOf Saviour to mankind, and which way first\rPublish his God-like office now mature,\rOne day forth walk'd alone, the Spirit leading;\rAnd his deep thoughts, the better to converse\rWith solitude, till far from track of men,\rThought following thought, and step by step led on,\rHe entred now the bordering Desert wild,\rAnd with dark shades and rocks environ'd round,\rHis holy Meditations thus persu'd.\rO what a multitude of thoughts at once\rAwakn'd in me swarm, while I consider\rWhat from within I feel my self, and hear\rWhat from without comes often to my ears,\rIll sorting with my present state compar'd.\rWhen I was yet a child, no childish play\rTo me was pleasing, all my mind was set\rSerious to learn and know, and thence to do\rWhat might be publick good; my self I thought\rBorn to that end, born to promote all truth,\rAll righteous things: therefore above my years,\rThe Law of God I read, and found it sweet,\rMade it my whole delight, and in it grew\rTo such perfection, that e're yet my age\rHad measur'd twice six years, at our great Feast\rI went into the Temple, there to hear\rThe Teachers of our Law, and to propose\rWhat might improve my knowledge or their own;\rAnd was admir'd by all, yet this not all\rTo which my Spirit aspir'd, victorious deeds\rFlam'd in my heart, heroic acts, one while\rTo rescue\rIsrael\rfrom the\rRoman\ryoke,\rThen to subdue and quell o're all the earth\rBrute violence and proud Tyrannick pow'r,\rTill truth were freed, and equity restor'd:\rYet held it more humane, more heavenly first\rBy winning words to conquer willing hearts,\rAnd make perswasion do the work of fear;\rAt least to try, and teach the erring Soul\rNot wilfully mis-doing, but unware\rMisled; the stubborn only to destroy.\rThese growing thoughts my Mother soon perceiving\rBy words at times cast forth inly rejoyc'd,\rAnd said to me apart,\rhigh are thy thoughts\rO Son, but nourish them and let them soar\rTo what highth sacred vertue and true worth\rCan raise them, though above example high;\rBy matchless Deeds express thy matchless Sire.\rFor know, thou art no Son of mortal man,\rThough men esteem thee low of Parentage,\rThy Father is the Eternal King, who rules\rAll Heaven and Earth, Angels and Sons of men,\rA messenger from God fore-told thy birth\rConceiv'd in me a Virgin, he fore-told\rThou shouldst be great and sit on\rDavid\r's Throne,\rAnd of thy Kingdom there should be no end.\rAt thy Nativity a glorious Quire\rOf Angels in the fields of\rBethlehem\rsung\rTo Shepherds watching at their folds by night,\rAnd told them the Messiah now was born,\rWhere they might see him, and to thee they came;\rDirected to the Manger where thou lais't,\rFor in the Inn was left no better room:\rA Star, not seen before in Heaven appearing\rGuided the Wise Men thither from the East,\rTo honour thee with Incense, Myrrh, and Gold,\rBy whose bright course led on they found the place,\rAffirming it thy Star new grav'n in Heaven,\rBy which they knew thee King of\rIsrael\rborn.\rJust\rSimeon\rand Prophetic\rAnna\r, warn'd\rBy Vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake\rBefore the Altar and the vested Priest,\rLike things of thee to all that present stood.\rThis having heard, strait I again revolv'd\rThe Law and Prophets, searching what was writ\rConcerning the Messiah, to our Scribes\rKnown partly, and soon found of whom they spake\rI am; this chiefly, that my way must lie\rThrough many a hard assay even to the death,\rE're I the promis'd Kingdom can attain,\rOr work Redemption for mankind, whose sins\rFull weight must be transferr'd upon my head.\rYet neither thus disheartn'd or dismay'd,\rThe time prefixt I waited, when behold\rThe Baptist, (of whose birth I oft had heard,\rNot knew by sight) now come, who was to come\rBefore Messiah and his way prepare.\rI as all others to his Baptism came,\rWhich I believ'd was from above; but he\rStrait knew me, and with loudest voice proclaim'd\rMe him (for it was shew'n him so from Heaven)\rMe him whose Harbinger he was; and first\rRefus'd on me his Baptism to confer,\rAs much his greater, and was hardly won;\rBut as I rose out of the laving stream,\rHeaven open'd her eternal doors, from whence\rThe Spirit descended on me like a Dove,\rAnd last the sum of all, my Father's voice,\rAudibly heard from Heav'n, pronounc'd me his,\rMe his beloved Son, in whom alone\rHe was well pleas'd; by which I knew the time\rNow full, that I no more should live obscure,\rBut openly begin, as best becomes\rThe Authority which I deriv'd from Heaven.\rAnd now by some strong motion I am led\rInto this Wilderness, to what intent\rI learn not yet, perhaps I need not know;\rFor what concerns my knowledge God reveals.\rSo spake our Morning Star then in his rise,\rAnd looking round on every side beheld\rA pathless Desert, dusk with horrid shades;\rThe way he came not having mark'd, return\rWas difficult, by humane steps untrod;\rAnd he still on was led, but with such thoughts\rAccompanied of things past and to come\rLodg'd in his breast, as well might recommend\rSuch Solitude before choicest Society.\rFull forty days he pass'd, whether on hill\rSometimes, anon in shady vale, each night\rUnder the covert of some ancient Oak,\rOr Cedar, to defend him from the dew,\rOr harbour'd in one Cave, is not reveal'd;\rNor tasted humane food, nor hunger felt\rTill those days ended, hunger'd then at last\rAmong wild Beasts: they at his sight grew mild,\rNor sleeping him nor waking harm'd, his walk\rThe fiery Serpent fled, and noxious Worm,\rThe Lion and fierce Tiger glar'd aloof.\rBut now an aged man in Rural weeds,\rFollowing, as seem'd, the quest of some stray Ewe,\rOr wither'd sticks to gather; which might serve\rAgainst a Winters day when winds blow keen,\rTo warm him wet return'd from field at Eve,\rHe saw approach, who first with curious eye\rPerus'd him, then with words thus utt'red spake.\rSir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place\rSo far from path or road of men, who pass\rIn Troop or Caravan, for single none\rDurst ever, who return'd, and dropt not here\rHis Carcass, pin'd with hunger and with droughth?\rI ask the rather, and the more admire,\rFor that to me thou seem'st the man, whom late\rOur new baptizing Prophet at the Ford\rOf\rJordan\rhonour'd so, and call'd thee Son\rOf God; I saw and heard, for we sometimes\rWho dwell this wild, constrain'd by want, come forth\rTo Town or Village nigh (nighest is far)\rWhere ought we hear, and curious are to hear,\rWhat happ'ns new; Fame also finds us out.\rTo whom the Son of God.\rWho brought me hither\rWill bring me hence, no other Guide I seek.\rBy Miracle he may,\rreply'd the Swain,\rWhat other way I see not, for we here\rLive on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inur'd\rMore then the Camel, and to drink go far,\rMen to much misery and hardship born;\rBut if thou be the Son of God, Command\rThat out of these hard stones be made thee bread;\rSo shalt thou save thy self and us relieve\rWith Food, whereof we wretched seldom taste.\rHe ended, and the Son of God reply'd.\rThink'st thou such force in Bread? is it not written\r(For I discern thee other then thou seem'st)\rMan lives not by Bread only, but each Word\rProceeding from the mouth of God; who fed\rOur Fathers here with Manna; in the Mount\rMoses\rwas forty days, nor eat nor drank,\rAnd forty days\rEliah\rwithout food\rWandred this barren waste, the same I now.\rWhy dost thou then suggest to me distrust,\rKnowing who I am, as I know who thou art?\rWhom thus answer'd th' Arch Fiend now undisguis'd.\r'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate,\rWho leagu'd with millions more in rash revolt\rKept not my happy Station, but was driv'n\rWith them from bliss to the bottomless deep,\rYet to that hideous place not so confin'd\rBy rigour unconniving, but that oft\rLeaving my dolorous Prison I enjoy\rLarge liberty to round this Globe of Earth,\rOr range in th' Air, nor from the Heav'n of Heav'ns\rHath he excluded my resort sometimes.\rI came among the Sons of God, when he\rGave up into my hands\rUzzean Job\rTo prove him, and illustrate his high worth;\rAnd when to all his Angels he propos'd\rTo draw the proud King\rAhab\rinto fraud\rThat he might fall in\rRamoth\r, they demuring,\rI undertook that office, and the tongues\rOf all his flattering Prophets glibb'd with lyes\rTo his destruction, as I had in charge.\rFor what he bids I do; though I have lost\rMuch lustre of my native brightness, lost\rTo be belov'd of God, I have not lost\rTo love, at least contemplate and admire\rWhat I see excellent in good, or fair,\rOr vertuous, I should so have lost all sense.\rWhat can be then less in me then desire\rTo see thee and approach thee, whom I know\rDeclar'd the Son of God, to hear attent\rThy wisdom, and behold thy God-like deeds?\rMen generally think me much a foe\rTo all mankind: why should I? they to me\rNever did wrong or violence, by them\rI lost not what I lost, rather by them\rI gain'd what I have gain'd, and with them dwell\rCopartner in these Regions of the World,\rIf not disposer; lend them oft my aid,\rOft my advice by presages and signs,\rAnd answers, oracles, portents and dreams,\rWhereby\rsome copies have Wherbey\rthey may direct their future life.\rEnvy they say excites me, thus to gain\rCompanions of my misery and wo.\rAt first it may be; but long since with wo\rNearer acquainted, now I feel by proof,\rThat fellowship in pain divides not smart,\rNor lightens aught each mans peculiar load.\rSmall consolation then, were Man adjoyn'd:\rThis wounds me most (what can it less) that Man,\rMan fall'n shall be restor'd, I never more.\rTo whom our Saviour sternly thus reply'd.\rDeservedly thou griev'st, compos'd of lyes\rFrom the beginning, and in lies wilt end;\rWho boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come\rInto the Heav'n of Heavens; thou com'st indeed,\rAs a poor miserable captive thrall,\rComes to the place where he before had sat\rAmong the Prime in Splendour, now depos'd,\rEjected, emptyed, gaz'd, unpityed, shun'd,\rA spectacle of ruin or of scorn\rTo all the Host of Heaven; the happy place\rImparts to thee no happiness, no joy,\rRather inflames thy torment, representing\rLost bliss, to thee no more communicable,\rSo never more in Hell then when in Heaven.\rBut thou art serviceable to Heaven's King.\rWilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear\rExtorts, or pleasure to do ill excites?\rWhat but thy malice mov'd thee to misdeem\rOf righteous\rsome copies have irghteous\rJob\r, then cruelly to afflict him\rWith all inflictions, but his patience won?\rThe other service was thy chosen task,\rTo be a lyer in four hundred mouths;\rFor lying is thy sustenance, thy food.\rYet thou pretend'st to truth; all Oracles\rBy thee are giv'n, and what confest more true\rAmong the Nations? that hath been thy craft,\rBy mixing somewhat true to vent more lyes.\rBut what have been thy answers, what but dark\rAmbiguous and with double sense deluding,\rWhich they who ask'd have seldom understood,\rAnd not well understood as good not known?\rWho ever by consulting at thy shrine\rReturn'd the wiser, or the more instruct\rTo flye or follow what concern'd him most,\rAnd run not sooner to his fatal snare?\rFor God hath justly giv'n the Nations up\rTo thy Delusions; justly, since they fell\rIdolatrous, but when his purpose is\rAmong them to declare his Providence\rTo thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth,\rBut from him or his Angels President\rIn every Province, who themselves disdaining\rTo approach thy Temples, give thee in command\rWhat to the smallest tittle thou shalt say\rTo thy Adorers; thou with trembling fear,\rOr like a Fawning Parasite obey'st;\rThen to thy self ascrib'st the truth fore-told.\rBut this thy glory shall be soon retrench'd;\rNo more shalt thou by oracling abuse\rThe Gentiles; henceforth Oracles are ceast,\rAnd thou no more with Pomp and Sacrifice\rShalt be enquir'd at\rDelphos\ror elsewhere,\rAt least in vain, for they shall find thee mute.\rGod hath now sent his living Oracle\rInto the World, to teach his final will,\rAnd sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell\rIn pious Hearts, an inward Oracle\rTo all truth requisite for men to know.\rSo spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend,\rThough inly stung with anger and disdain,\rDissembl'd, and this Answer smooth return'd.\rSharply thou hast insisted on rebuke,\rAnd urg'd me hard with doings, which not will\rBut misery hath rested from me; where\rEasily canst thou find one miserable,\rAnd not inforc'd oft-times to part from truth;\rIf it may stand him more in stead to lye,\rSay and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?\rBut thou art plac't above me, thou art Lord;\rFrom thee I can and must submiss endure\rCheck or reproof, and glad to scape so quit.\rHard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk,\rSmooth on the tongue discourst, pleasing to th' ear,\rAnd tuneable as Silvan Pipe or Song;\rWhat wonder then if I delight to hear\rHer dictates from thy mouth? most men admire\rVertue, who follow not her lore: permit me >\rTo hear thee when I come (since no man comes)\rAnd talk at least, though I despair to attain.\rThy Father, who is holy, wise and pure,\rSuffers the Hypocrite or Atheous Priest\rTo tread his Sacred Courts, and minister\rAbout his Altar, handling holy things,\rPraying or vowing, and vouchsaf'd his voice\rTo\rBalaam\rReprobate, a Prophet yet\rInspir'd; disdain not such access to me.\rTo whom our Saviour with unalter'd brow.\rThy coming hither, though I know thy scope,\rI bid not or forbid; do as thou find'st\rPermission from above; thou canst not more.\rHe added not; and\rSatan\rbowing low\rHis gray dissimulation, disappear'd\rInto thin Air diffus'd: for now began\rNight with her sullen wing to double-shade\rThe Desert, Fowls in thir clay nests were couch't;\rAnd now wild Beasts came forth the woods to roam.\rThe End of the First Book'.\rPARADISE REGAIN'D.\rThe Second BOOK.\rMEan while the new-baptiz'd, who yet remain'd\rAt\rJordan\rwith the Baptist, and had seen\rHim whom they heard so late expresly call'd\rJesus\rMessiah Son of God declar'd,\rAnd on that high Authority had believ'd,\rAnd with him talkt, and with him lodg'd, I mean\rAndrew\rand\rSimon\r, famous after known\rWith others though in Holy Writ not nam'd,\rNow missing him thir joy so lately found,\rSo lately found, and so abruptly gone,\rBegan to doubt, and doubted many days,\rAnd as the days increas'd, increas'd thir doubt:\rSometimes they thought he might be only shewn,\rAnd for a time caught up to God, as once\rMoses\rwas in the Mount, and missing long;\rAnd the great\rThisbite\rwho on fiery wheels\rRode up to Heaven, yet once again to come.\rTherefore as those young Prophets then with care\rSought lost\rEliah\r, so in each place these\rNigh to\rBethabara\r; in\rJerico\rThe City of Palms,\r\xc2\xaenon\r, and\rSalem\rOld,\rMach\xc2\xberus\rand each Town or City wall'd\rOn this side the broad lake\rGenezaret\r,\rOr in\rPerea\r, but return'd in vain.\rThen on the bank of\rJordan\r, by a Creek:\rWhere winds with Reeds, and Osiers whisp'ring play\rPlain Fishermen, no greater men them call,\rClose in a Cottage low together got\rThir unexpected loss and plaints out breath'd.\rAlas, from what high hope to what relapse\rUnlook'd for are we fall'n, our eyes beheld\rMessiah certainly now come, so long\rExpected of our Fathers; we have heard\rHis words, his wisdom full of grace and truth,\rNow, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand,\rThe Kingdom shall to\rIsrael\rbe restor'd:\rThus we rejoyc'd, but soon our joy is turn'd\rInto perplexity and new amaze:\rFor whither is he gone, what accident\rHath rapt him from us? will he now retire\rAfter appearance, and again prolong\rOur expectation? God of\rIsrael\r,\rSend thy Messiah forth, the time is come;\rBehold the Kings of the Earth how they oppress\rThy chosen, to what highth thir pow'r unjust\rThey have exalted, and behind them cast\rAll fear of thee, arise and vindicate\rThy Glory, free thy people from thir yoke,\rBut let us wait; thus far he hath perform'd,\rSent his Anointed, and to us reveal'd him,\rBy his great Prophet, pointed at and shown,\rIn publick, and with him we have convers'd;\rLet us be glad of this, and all our fears\rLay on his Providence; he will not fail\rNor will withdraw him now, nor will recall,\rMock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence,\rSoon we shall see our hope, our joy return.\rThus they out of their plaints new hope resume\rTo find whom at the first they found unsought:\rBut to his Mother\rMary\r, when she saw\rOthers return'd from Baptism, not her Son,\rNor left at\rJordan\r, tydings of him none;\rWithin her brest, though calm; her brest though pure,\rMotherly cares and fears got head, and rais'd\rSome troubl'd thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad.\rO what avails me now that honour high\rTo have conceiv'd of God, or that salute\rHale highly favour'd, among women blest;\rWhile I to sorrows am no less advanc't,\rAnd fears as eminent, above the lot\rOf other women, by the birth I bore,\rIn such a season born when scarce a Shed\rCould be obtain'd to shelter him or me\rFrom the bleak air; a Stable was our warmth,\rA Manger his, yet soon enforc't to flye\rThence into\rEgypt\r, till the Murd'rous King\rWere dead, who sought his life, and missing fill'd\rWith Infant blood the streets of\rBethlehem\r;\rFrom\rEgypt\rhome return'd, in\rNazareth\rHath been our dwelling many years, his life\rPrivate, unactive, calm, contemplative,\rLittle suspicious to any King; but now\rFull grown to Man, acknowledg'd, as I hear,\rBy\rJohn\rthe Baptist, and in publick shown,\rSon own'd from Heaven by his Father's voice;\rI look't for some great change; to Honour? no,\rBut trouble, as old\rSimeon\rplain fore-told,\rThat to the fall and rising he should be\rOf many in\rIsrael\r, and to a sign\rSpoken against, that through my very Soul\rA sword shall pierce, this is my favour'd lot,\rMy Exaltation to Afflictions high;\rAfflicted I may be, it seems, and blest;\rI will not argue that, nor will repine.\rBut where delays he now? some great intent\rConceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen,\rI lost him, but so found, as well I saw\rHe could not lose himself; but went about\rHis Father's business; what he meant I mus'd,\rSince understand; much more his absence now\rThus long to some great purpose he obscures.\rBut I to wait with patience am inur'd;\rMy heart hath been a store-house long of things\rAnd sayings laid up, portending strange events.\rThus\rMary\rpondering oft, and oft to mind\rRecalling what remarkably had pass'd\rSince first her Salutation heard, with thoughts\rMeekly compos'd awaited the fulfilling:\rThe while her Son tracing the Desert wild,\rSole but with holiest Meditations fed,\rInto himself descended, and at once\rAll his great work to come before him set;\rHow to begin, how to accomplish best\rHis end of being on Earth, and mission high:\rFor\rSatan\rwith slye preface to return\rHad left him vacant, and with speed was gon\rUp to the middle Region of thick Air,\rWhere all his Potentates in Council sate;\rThere without sign of boast, or sign of joy,\rSollicitous and blank he thus began.\rPrinces, Heavens antient Sons, \xc2\xaethereal Thrones,\rDemonian Spirits now, from the Element\rEach of his reign allotted, rightlier call'd,\rPowers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath,\rSo may we hold our place and these mild seats\rWithout new trouble; such an Enemy\rIs ris'n to invade us, who no less\rThreat'ns then our expulsion down to Hell;\rI, as I undertook, and with the vote\rConsenting in full frequence was impowr'd,\rHave found him, view'd him, tasted him, but find\rFar other labour to be undergon\rThen when I dealt with\rAdam\rfirst of Men,\rThough\rAdam\rby his Wives allurement fell,\rHowever to this Man inferior far,\rIf he be Man by Mothers side at least,\rWith more then humane gifts from Heaven adorn'd,\rPerfections absolute, Graces divine,\rAnd amplitude of mind to greatest Deeds.\rTherefore I am return'd, lest confidence\rOf my success with\rEve\rin\rParadise\rDeceive ye to perswasion over-sure\rOf like succeeding here; I summon all\rRather to be in readiness, with hand\rOr counsel to assist; lest I who erst\rThought none my equal, now be over-match'd.\rSo spake the old Serpent doubting, and from all\rWith clamour was assur'd thir utmost aid\rAt his command; when from amidst them rose\rBelial\rthe dissolutest Spirit that fell,\rThe sensuallest, and after\rAsmodai\rThe fleshliest Incubus, and thus advis'd.\rSet women in his eye and in his walk,\rAmong daughters of men the fairest found;\rMany are in each Region passing fair\rAs the noon Skie; more like to Goddesses\rThen Mortal Creatures, graceful and discreet,\rExpert in amorous Arts, enchanting tongues\rPerswasive, Virgin majesty with mild\rAnd sweet allay'd, yet terrible to approach,\rSkill'd to retire, and in retiring draw\rHearts after them tangl'd in Amorous Nets.\rSuch object hath the power to soft'n and tame\rSeverest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow,\rEnerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve,\rDraw out with credulous desire, and lead\rAt will the manliest, resolutest brest,\rAs the Magnetic hardest Iron draws.\rWomen, when nothing else, beguil'd the heart\rOf wisest\rSolomon\r, and made him build,\rAnd made him bow to the Gods of his Wives.\rTo whom quick answer\rSatan\rthus return'd.\rBelial\r, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st\rAll others by thy self; because of old\rThou thy self doat'st on womankind, admiring\rThir shape, thir colour, and attractive grace,\rNone are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys.\rBefore the Flood thou with thy lusty Crew,\rFalse titl'd Sons of God, roaming the Earth\rCast wanton eyes on the daughters of men,\rAnd coupl'd with them, and begot a race.\rHave we not seen, or by relation heard,\rIn Courts and Regal Chambers how thou lurk'st,\rIn Wood or Grove by mossie Fountain side,\rIn Valley or Green Meadow to way-lay\rSome beauty rare,\rCalisto\r,\rClymene\r,\rDaphne\r, or\rSemele\r,\rAntiopa\r,\rOr\rAmymone\r,\rSyrinx\r, many more\rToo long, then lay'st thy scapes on names ador'd,\rApollo\r,\rNeptune\r,\rJupiter\r, or\rPan\r,\rSatyr, or Fawn, or Silvan? But these haunts\rDelight not all; among the Sons of Men,\rHow many have with a smile made small account\rOf beauty and her lures, easily scorn'd\rAll her assaults, on worthier things intent?\rRemember that\rPellean\rConquerour,\rA youth, how all the Beauties of the East\rHe slightly view'd, and slightly over-pass'd;\rHow hee sirnam'd of\rAfrica\rdismiss'd\rIn his prime youth the fair\rIberian\rmaid.\rFor\rSolomon\rhe liv'd at ease, and full\rOf honour, wealth, high fare, aim'd not beyond\rHigher design then to enjoy his State;\rThence to the bait of Women lay expos'd;\rBut he whom we attempt is wiser far\rThen\rSolomon\r, of more exalted mind,\rMade and set wholly on the accomplishment\rOf greatest things; what woman will you find,\rThough of this Age the wonder and the fame,\rOn whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye\rOf fond desire? or should she confident,\rAs sitting Queen ador'd on Beauties Throne,\rDescend with all her winning charms begirt\rTo enamour, as the Zone of\rVenus\ronce\rWrought that effect on\rJove\r, so Fables tell;\rHow would one look from his Majestick brow\rSeated as on the top of Vertues hill,\rDiscount'nance her despis'd, and put to rout\rAll her array; her female pride deject,\rOr turn to reverent awe? for Beauty stands\rIn the admiration only of weak minds\rLed captive; cease to admire, and all her Plumes\rFall flat and shrink into a trivial toy,\rAt every sudden slighting quite abasht:\rTherefore with manlier objects we must try\rHis constancy, with such as have more shew\rOf worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise;\rRocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd;\rOr that which only seems to satisfie\rLawful desires of Nature, not beyond;\rAnd now I know he hungers where no food\rIs to be found, in the wide Wilderness;\rThe rest commit to me, I shall let pass\rNo advantage, and his strength as oft assay.\rHe ceas'd, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim;\rThen forthwith to him takes a chosen band\rOf Spirits likest to himself in guile\rTo be at hand, and at his beck appear,\rIf cause were to unfold some active Scene\rOf various persons each to know his part;\rThen to the Desert takes with these his flight;\rWhere still from shade to shade the Son of God\rAfter forty days fasting had remain'd,\rNow hungring first, and to himself thus said.\rWhere will this end? four times ten days I have pass'd\rWandring this woody maze, and humane food\rNor tasted, nor had appetite; that Fast\rTo Vertue I impute not, or count part\rOf what I suffer here; if Nature need not,\rOr God support Nature without repast\rThough needing, what praise is it to endure?\rBut now I feel I hunger, which declares,\rNature hath need of what she asks; yet God\rCan satisfie that need some other way,\rThough hunger still remain: so it remain\rWithout this bodies wasting, I content me,\rAnd from the sting of Famine fear no harm,\rNor mind it, fed with better thoughts that feed\rMee hungring more to do my Fathers will.\rIt was the hour of night, when thus the Son\rCommun'd in silent walk, then laid him down\rUnder the hospitable covert nigh\rOf Trees thick interwoven; there he slept,\rAnd dream'd, as appetite is wont to dream,\rOf meats and drinks, Natures refreshment sweet;\rHim thought, he by the Brook of\rCherith\rstood\rAnd saw the Ravens with their horny beaks\rFood to\rElijah\rbringing Even and Morn,\rThough ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought:\rHe saw the Prophet also how he fled\rInto the Desert, and how there he slept\rUnder a Juniper; then how awakt,\rHe found his Supper on the coals prepar'd,\rAnd by the Angel was bid rise and eat,\rAnd eat the second time after repose,\rThe strength whereof suffic'd him forty days;\rSometimes that with\rElijah\rhe partook,\rOr as a guest with\rDaniel\rat his pulse.\rThus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark\rLeft his ground-nest, high towring to descry\rThe morns approach, and greet her with his Song:\rAs lightly from his grassy Couch up rose\rOur Saviour, and found all was but a dream,\rFasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd.\rUp to a hill anon his steps he rear'd,\rFrom whose high top to ken the prospect round,\rIf Cottage were in view, Sheep-cote or Herd;\rBut Cottage, Herd or Sheep-cote none he saw,\rOnly in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove,\rWith chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud;\rThither he bent his way, determin'd there\rTo rest at noon, and entr'd soon the shade\rHigh rooft and walks beneath, and alleys brown\rThat open'd in the midst a woody Scene,\rNatures own work it seem'd (Nature taught Art)\rAnd to a Superstitious eye the haunt\rOf Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view'd it round,\rWhen suddenly a man before him stood,\rNot rustic as before, but seemlier clad,\rAs one in City, or Court, or Palace bred,\rAnd with fair speech these words to him address'd.\rWith granted leave officious I return,\rBut much more wonder that the Son of God\rIn this wild solitude so long should bide\rOf all things destitute, and well I know,\rNot without hunger. Others of some note,\rAs story tells, have trod this Wilderness;\rThe Fugitive Bond-woman with her Son\rOut cast\rNebaioth\r, yet found he relief\rBy a providing Angel; all the race\rOf\rIsrael\rhere had famish'd, had not God\rRain'd from Heaven Manna, and that Prophet bold\rNative of\rThebes\rwandring here was fed\rTwice by a voice inviting him to eat.\rOf thee these forty days none hath regard,\rForty and more deserted here indeed.\rTo whom thus Jesus;\rwhat conclud'st thou hence?\rThey all had need, I as thou seest have none.\rHow hast thou hunger then?\rSatan reply'd,\rTell me if Food were now before thee set,\rWould'st thou not eat?\rThereafter as I like\rThe giver,\ranswer'd\rJesus\r.\rWhy should that\rCause thy refusal,\rsaid the subtle Fiend,\rHast thou not right to all Created things,\rOwe not all Creatures by just right to thee\rDuty and Service, nor to stay till bid,\rBut tender all their power? nor mention I\rMeats by the Law unclean, or offer'd first\rTo Idols, those young\rDaniel\rcould refuse;\rNor proffer'd by an Enemy, though who\rWould scruple that, with want opprest? behold\rNature asham'd, or better to express,\rTroubl'd that thou shouldst hunger, hath purvey'd\rFrom all the Elements her choicest store\rTo treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord\rWith honour, only deign to sit and eat.\rHe spake no dream, for as his words had end,\rOur Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld\rIn ample space under the broadest shade\rA Table richly spred, in regal mode,\rWith dishes pill'd, and meats of noblest sort\rAnd savour, Beasts of chase, or Fowl of game,\rIn pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl'd,\rGris-amber-steam'd; all Fish from Sea or Shore,\rFreshet, or purling Brook, of shell or fin,\rAnd exquisitest name, for which was drain'd\rPontus\rand\rLucrine\rBay, and\rAfric\rCoast.\rAlas how simple, to these Cates compar'd,\rWas that crude Apple that diverted\rEve\r!\rAnd at a stately side-board by the wine\rThat fragrant smell diffus'd, in order stood\rTall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew\rThen\rGanymed\ror\rHylas\r, distant more\rUnder the Trees now trip'd, now solemn stood\rNymphs of\rDiana\r's train, and\rNaiades\rWith fruits and flowers from\rAmalthea\r's horn,\rAnd Ladies of th'\rHesperides\r, that seem'd\rFairer then feign'd of old, or fabl'd since\rOf Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide\rBy Knights of\rLogres\r, or of\rLyones\r,\rLancelot\ror\rPelleas\r, or\rPellenore\r,\rAnd all the while Harmonious Airs were heard\rOf chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds\rOf gentlest gale\rArabian\rodors fann'd\rFrom their soft wings, and\rFlora\r's earliest smells.\rSuch was the Splendour, and the Tempter now\rHis invitation earnestly renew'd.\rWhat doubts the Son of God to sit and eat?\rThese are not Fruits forbidden, no interdict\rDefends the touching of these viands pure,\rThir taste no knowledge works, at least of evil,\rBut life preserves, destroys life's enemy,\rHunger, with sweet restorative delight.\rAll these are Spirits of Air, and Woods, and Springs,\rThy gentle Ministers, who come to pay\rThee homage, and acknowledge thee thir Lord:\rWhat doubt'st thou Son of God? sit down and eat.\rTo whom thus\rJesus\rtemperately reply'd:\rSaid'st thou not that to all things I had right?\rAnd who withholds my pow'r that right to use?\rShall I receive by gift what of my own,\rWhen and where likes me best, I can command?\rI can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou,\rCommand a Table in this Wilderness,\rAnd call swift flights of Angels ministrant\rArray'd in Glory on my cup to attend:\rWhy shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence,\rIn vain, where no acceptance it can find,\rAnd with my hunger what has thou to do?\rThy pompous Delicacies I contemn,\rAnd count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles.\rTo whom thus answer'd\rSatan\rmalecontent:\rThat I have also power to give thou seest,\rIf of that pow'r I bring thee voluntary\rWhat I might have bestow'd on whom I pleas'd,\rAnd rather opportunely in this place\rChose to impart to thy apparent need,\rWhy shouldst thou not accept it? but I see\rWhat I can do or offer is suspect;\rOf these things others quickly will dispose\rWhose pains have earn'd the far fet spoil.\rWith that\rBoth Table and Provision vanish'd quite\rWith sound of Harpies wings, and Talons heard;\rOnly the importune Tempter still remain'd,\rAnd with these words his temptation pursu'd.\rBy hunger, that each other Creature tames,\rThou art not to be harm'd, therefore not mov'd;\rThy temperance invincible besides,\rFor no allurement yields to appetite,\rAnd all thy heart is set on high designs,\rHigh actions; but wherewith to be atchiev'd?\rGreat acts require great means of enterprise,\rThou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth,\rA Carpenter thy Father known, thy self\rBred up in poverty and streights at home;\rLost in a Desert here and hunger-bit:\rWhich way or from what hope dost thou aspire\rTo greatness? whence Authority deriv'st,\rWhat Followers, what Retinue canst thou gain,\rOr at thy heels the dizzy Multitude,\rLonger then thou canst feed them on thy cost?\rMoney brings Honour, Friends, Conquest, and Realms;\rWhat rais'd\rAntipater\rthe\rEdomite\r,\rAnd his Son\rHerod\rplac'd on\rJuda\r's Throne;\r(Thy throne) but gold that got him puissant friends?\rTherefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive,\rGet Riches first, get Wealth, and Treasure heap,\rNot difficult, if thou hearken to me,\rRiches are mine, Fortune is in my hand;\rThey whom I favour thrive in wealth amain,\rWhile Virtue, Valour, Wisdom sit in want.\rTo whom thus\rJesus\rpatiently reply'd;\rYet Wealth without these three is impotent,\rTo gain dominion or to keep it gain'd.\rWitness those antient Empires of the Earth,\rIn highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv'd:\rBut men endu'd with these have oft attain'd\rIn lowest poverty to highest deeds;\rGideon\rand\rJephtha\r, and the Shepherd lad,\rWhose off-spring on the Throne of\rJuda\rsat\rSo many Ages, and shall yet regain\rThat seat, and reign in\rIsrael\rwithout end.\rAmong the Heathen, (for throughout the World\rTo me is not unknown what hath been done\rWorthy of Memorial) canst thou not remember\rQuintius\r,\rFabricius\r,\rCurius\r,\rRegulus\r?\rFor I esteem those names of men so poor\rWho could do mighty things, and could contemn\rRiches though offer'd from the hand of Kings.\rAnd what in me seems wanting, but that I\rMay also in this poverty as soon\rAccomplish what they did, perhaps and more?\rExtol not Riches then, the toyl of Fools,\rThe wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more apt\rTo slacken Virtue, and abate her edge,\rThen prompt her to do aught may merit praise.\rWhat if with like aversion I reject\rRiches and Realms; yet not for that a Crown,\rGolden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns,\rBrings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights\rTo him who wears the Regal Diadem,\rWhen on his shoulders each mans burden lies;\rFor therein stands the office of a King,\rHis Honour, Vertue, Merit and chief Praise,\rThat for the Publick all this weight he bears.\rYet he who reigns within himself, and rules\rPassions, Desires, and Fears, is more a King; >\rWhich every wise and vertuous man attains:\rAnd who attains not, ill aspires to rule\rCities of men or head-strong Multitudes,\rSubject himself to Anarchy within,\rOr lawless passions in him which he serves.\rBut to guide Nations in the way of truth\rBy saving Doctrine, and from errour lead\rTo know, and knowing worship God aright,\rIs yet more Kingly, this attracts the Soul,\rGoverns the inner man, the nobler part,\rThat other o're the body only reigns,\rAnd oft by force, which to a generous mind\rSo reigning can be no sincere delight.\rBesides to give a Kingdom hath been thought\rGreater and nobler done, and to lay down\rFar more magnanimous, then to assume.\rRiches are needless then, both for themselves,\rAnd for thy reason why they should be sought,\rTo gain a Scepter, oftest better miss't.\rThe End of the Second Book.\rPARADISE REGAIN'D.\rThe Third BOOK.\rSO spake the Son of God, and\rSatan\rstood\rA while as mute confounded what to say,\rWhat to reply, confuted and convinc,t\rOf his weak arguing, and fallacious drift;\rAt length collecting all his Serpent wiles,\rWith soothing words renew'd, him thus accosts.\rI see thou know'st what is of use to know,\rWhat best to say canst say, to do canst do;\rThy actions to thy words accord, thy words\rTo thy large heart give utterance due, thy heart\rConteins of good, wise, just, the perfect shape.\rShould Kings and Nations from thy mouth consult,\rThy Counsel would be as the Oracle\rUrim\rand\rThummim\r, those oraculous gems\rOn\rAaron\r's breast: or tongue of Seers old\rInfallible; or wert thou sought to deeds\rThat might require th' array of war, thy skill\rOf conduct would be such, that all the world\rCould not sustain thy Prowess, or subsist\rIn battel, though against thy few in arms.\rThese God-like Vertues wherefore dost thou hide?\rAffecting private life, or more obscure\rIn savage Wilderness, wherefore deprive\rAll Earth her wonder at thy acts, thy self\rThe fame and glory, glory the reward\rThat sole excites to high attempts the flame\rOf most erected Spirits, most temper'd pure\r\xc2\xaetherial, who all pleasures else despise,\rAll treasures and all gain esteem as dross,\rAnd dignities and powers all but the highest?\rThy years are ripe, and over-ripe, the Son\rOf\rMacedonian Philip\rhad e're these\rWon\rAsia\rand the Throne of\rCyrus\rheld\rAt his dispose, young\rScipio\rhad brought down\rThe\rCarthaginian\rpride, young\rPompey\rquell'd\rThe\rPontic\rKing and in triumph had rode.\rYet years, and to ripe years judgment mature,\rQuench not the thirst of glory, but augment.\rGreat\rJulius\r, whom now all the world admires\rThe more he grew in years, the more inflam'd\rWith glory, wept that he had liv'd so long\rInglorious: but thou yet art not too late.\rTo whom our Saviour calmly thus reply'd.\rThou neither dost perswade me to seek wealth\rFor Empires sake, nor Empire to affect\rFor glories sake by all thy argument.\rFor what is glory but the blaze of fame,\rThe peoples praise, if always praise unmixt?\rAnd what the people but a herd confus'd,\rA miscellaneous rabble, who extol\rThings vulgar, & well weigh'd, scarce worth the praise,\rThey praise and they admire they know not what;\rAnd know not whom, but as one leads the other;\rAnd what delight to be by such extoll'd,\rTo live upon thir tongues and be thir talk,\rOf whom to be disprais'd were no small praise?\rHis lot who dares be singularly good.\rTh' intelligent among them and the wise\rAre few, and glory scarce of few is rais'd.\rThis is true glory and renown, when God\rLooking on the Earth, with approbation marks\rThe just man, and divulges him through Heaven\rTo all his Angels, who with true applause\rRecount his praises; thus he did to\rJob\r,\rWhen to extend his fame through Heaven & Earth,\rAs thou to thy reproach mayst well remember,\rHe ask'd thee,\rhast thou seen my servant\rJob\r?\rFamous he was in Heaven, on Earth less known;\rWhere glory is false glory, attributed\rTo things not glorious, men not worthy of fame.\rThey err who count it glorious to subdue\rBy Conquest far and wide, to over-run\rLarge Countries, and in field great Battels win,\rGreat Cities by assault: what do these Worthies,\rBut rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave\rPeaceable Nations, neighbouring, or remote,\rMade Captive, yet deserving freedom more\rThen those thir Conquerours, who leave behind\rNothing but ruin wheresoe're they rove,\rAnd all the flourishing works of peace destroy,\rThen swell with pride, and must be titl'd Gods,\rGreat Benefactors of mankind, Deliverers,\rWorship't with Temple, Priest and Sacrifice;\rOne is the Son of\rJove\r, of\rMars\rthe other,\rTill Conquerour Death discover them scarce men,\rRowling in brutish vices, and deform'd,\rViolent or shameful death thir due reward.\rBut if there be in glory aught of good,\rIt may by means far different be attain'd\rWithout ambition, war, or violence;\rBy deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent,\rBy patience, temperance; I mention still\rHim whom thy wrongs with Saintly patience born,\rMade famous in a Land and times obscure;\rWho names not now with honour patient\rJob\r?\rPoor\rSocrates\r(who next more memorable?)\rBy what he taught and suffer'd for so doing,\rFor truths sake suffering death unjust, lives now\rEqual in fame to proudest Conquerours.\rYet if for fame and glory aught be done,\rAught suffer'd; if young\rAfrican\rfor fame\rHis wasted Country freed from\rPunic\rrage,\rThe deed becomes unprais'd, the man at least,\rAnd loses, though but verbal, his reward.\rShall I seek glory then, as vain men seek\rOft not deserv'd? I seek not mine, but his\rWho sent me, and thereby witness whence I am.\rTo whom the Tempter murmuring thus reply'd.\rThink not so slight of glory; therein least\rResembling thy great Father: he seeks glory,\rAnd for his glory all things made, all things\rOrders and governs, nor content in Heaven\rBy all his Angels glorifi'd, requires\rGlory from men, from all men good or bad,\rWise or unwise, no difference, no exemption;\rAbove all Sacrifice, or hallow'd gift\rGlory he requires, and glory he receives\rPromiscuous from all Nations,\rJew\r, or\rGreek\r,\rOr Barbarous, nor exception hath declar'd;\rFrom us his foes pronounc't glory he exacts.\rTo whom our Saviour fervently reply'd.\rAnd reason; since his word all things produc'd,\rThough chiefly not for glory as prime end,\rBut to shew forth his goodness, and impart\rHis good communicable to every soul\rFreely; of whom what could he less expect\rThen glory and benediction, that is thanks,\rThe slightest, easiest, readiest recompence\rFrom them who could return him nothing else,\rAnd not returning that would likeliest render\rContempt instead, dishonour, obloquy?\rHard recompence, unsutable return\rFor so much good, so much beneficence.\rBut why should man seek glory? who of his own\rHath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs\rBut condemnation, ignominy, and shame?\rWho for so many benefits receiv'd\rTurn'd recreant to God, ingrate and false,\rAnd so of all true good himself despoil'd,\rYet, sacrilegious, to himself would take\rThat which to God alone of right belongs;\rYet so much bounty is in God, such grace,\rThat who advance his glory, not thir own,\rThem he himself to glory will advance.\rSo spake the Son of God; and here again\rSatan\rhad not to answer, but stood struck\rWith guilt of his own sin, for he himself\rInsatiable of glory had lost all,\rYet of another Plea bethought him soon.\rOf glory as thou wilt,\rsaid he,\rso deem,\rWorth or not worth the seeking, let it pass:\rBut to a Kingdom thou art born, ordain'd\rTo sit upon thy Father\rDavid\r's Throne;\rBy Mothers side thy Father, though thy right\rBe now in powerful hands, that will not part\rEasily from possession won with arms;\rJud\xc2\xbea\rnow and all the promis'd land\rReduc't a Province under\rRoman\ryoke,\rObeys\rTiberius\r; nor is always rul'd\rWith temperate sway; oft have they violated\rThe Temple, oft the Law with foul affronts,\rAbominations rather, as did once\rAntiochus\r: and think'st thou to regain\rThy right by sitting still or thus retiring?\rSo did not\rMachabeus\r: he indeed\rRetir'd unto the Desert, but with arms;\rAnd o're a mighty King so oft prevail'd,\rThat by strong hand his Family obtain'd,\rThough Priests, the Crown, and\rDavid\r's Throne usurp'd,\rWith\rModin\rand her Suburbs once content.\rIf Kingdom move thee not, let move thee Zeal,\rAnd Duty; Zeal and Duty are not slow;\rBut on Occasions forelock watchful wait.\rThey themselves rather are occasion best,\rZeal of thy Fathers house, Duty to free\rThy Country from her Heathen servitude;\rSo shalt thou best fullfil, best verifie\rThe Prophets old, who sung thy endless raign,\rThe happier raign the sooner it begins,\rRaign then; what canst thou better do the while?\rTo whom our Saviour answer thus return'd.\rAll things are best fullfil'd in their due time,\rAnd time there is for all things, Truth hath said:\rIf of my raign Prophetic Writ hath told,\rThat it shall never end, so when begin\rThe Father in his purpose hath decreed,\rHe in whose hand all times and seasons roul.\rWhat if he hath decreed that I shall first\rBe try'd in humble state, and things adverse,\rBy tribulations, injuries, insults,\rContempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence,\rSuffering, abstaining, quietly expecting\rWithout distrust or doubt, that he may know\rWhat I can suffer, how obey? who best\rCan suffer, best can do; best reign, who first\rWell hath obey'd; just tryal e're I merit\rMy exaltation without change or end.\rBut what concerns it thee when I begin\rMy everlasting Kingdom, why art thou\rSollicitous, what moves thy inquisition?\rKnow'st thou not that my rising is thy fall,\rAnd my promotion will be thy destruction?\rTo whom the Tempter inly rackt reply'd.\rLet that come when it comes; all hope is lost\rOf my reception into grace; what worse?\rFor where no hope is left, is left no fear;\rIf there be worse, the expectation more\rOf worse torments me then the feeling can.\rI would be at the worst; worst is my Port,\rMy harbour and my ultimate repose,\rThe end I would attain, my final good.\rMy error was my error and my crime\rMy crime; whatever for it self condemn'd,\rAnd will alike be punish'd;

for now the\rParthian\rKing\rIn\rCtesiphon\rhath gather'd all his Host\rAgainst the\rScythian\r, whose incursions wild\rHave wasted\rSogdiana\r; to her aid\rHe marches now in hast; see, though from far,\rHis thousands, in what martial equipage\rThey issue forth, Steel Bows, and Shafts their arms\rOf equal dread in flight, or in pursuit;\rAll Horsemen, in which fight they most excel;\rSee how in warlike muster they appear,\rIn Rhombs and wedges, and half moons, and wings.\rHe look't and saw what numbers numberless\rThe City gates out powr'd, light armed Troops\rIn coats of Mail and military pride;\rIn Mail thir horses clad, yet fleet and strong,\rPrauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice\rOf many Provinces from bound to bound;\rFrom\rArachosia\r, from\rCandaor\rEast,\rAnd\rMargiana\rto the\rHyrcanian\rcliffs\rOf\rCaucasus\r, and dark\rIberian\rdales,\rFrom\rAtropatia\rand the neighbouring plains\rOf\rAdiabene\r,\rMedia\r, and the South\rOf\rSusiana\rto\rBalsara\r's hav'n.\rHe saw them in thir forms of battell rang'd,\rHow quick they wheel'd, and flying behind them shot\rSharp sleet of arrowie showers against the face\rOf thir pursuers, and overcame by flight;\rThe field all iron cast a gleaming brown,\rNor wanted clouds of foot, nor on each horn,\rCuirassiers all in steel for standing fight;\rChariots or Elephants endorst with Towers\rOf Archers, nor of labouring Pioners\rA multitude with Spades and Axes arm'd\rTo lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill,\rOr where plain was raise hill, or over-lay\rWith bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke;\rMules after these, Camels and Dromedaries,\rAnd Waggons fraught with Utensils of war.\rSuch forces met not, nor so wide a camp,\rWhen\rAgrican\rwith all his Northern powers\rBesieg'd\rAlbracca\r, as Romances tell;\rThe City of\rGallaphrone\r, from thence to win\rThe fairest of her Sex\rAngelica\rHis daughter, sought by many Prowest Knights,\rBoth\rPaynim\r, and the Peers of\rCharlemane\r.\rSuch and so numerous was thir Chivalrie;\rAt sight whereof the Fiend yet more presum'd,\rAnd to our Saviour thus his words renew'd.\rThat thou may'st know I seek not to engage\rThy Vertue, and not every way secure\rOn no slight grounds thy safety; hear, and mark\rTo what end I have brought thee hither and shewn\rAll this fair sight; thy Kingdom though foretold\rBy Prophet or by Angel, unless thou\rEndeavour, as thy Father\rDavid\rdid,\rThou never shalt obtain; prediction still\rIn all things, and all men, supposes means,\rWithout means us'd, what it predicts revokes.\rBut say thou wer't possess'd of\rDavid\r's Throne\rBy free consent of all, none opposite,\rSamaritan\ror\rJew\r; how could'st thou hope\rLong to enjoy it quiet and secure,\rBetween two such enclosing enemies\rRoman\rand\rParthian\r? therefore one of these\rThou must make sure thy own, the\rParthian\rfirst\rBy my advice, as nearer and of late\rFound able by invasion to annoy\rThy country, and captive lead away her Kings\rAntigonus\r, and old\rHyrcanus\rbound,\rMaugre the\rRoman\r: it shall be my task\rTo render thee the\rParthian\rat dispose;\rChuse which thou wilt by conquest or by league.\rBy him thou shalt regain, without him not,\rThat which alone can truly reinstall thee\rIn\rDavid\r's royal seat, his true Successour,\rDeliverance of thy brethren, those ten Tribes\rWhose off-spring in his Territory yet serve\rIn\rHabor\r, and among the\rMedes\rdispers't,\rTen Sons of\rJacob\r, two of\rJoseph\rlost\rThus long from\rIsrael\r; serving as of old\rThir Fathers in the land of\rEgypt\rserv'd,\rThis offer sets before thee to deliver.\rThese if from servitude thou shalt restore\rTo thir inheritance, then, nor till then,\rThou on the Throne of\rDavid\rin full glory,\rFrom\rEgypt\rto\rEuphrates\rand beyond\rShalt raign, and\rRome\ror\rCaesar\rnot need fear.\rTo whom our Saviour answer'd thus unmov'd.\rMuch ostentation vain of fleshly arm,\rAnd fragile arms, much instrument of war\rLong in preparing, soon to nothing brought,\rBefore mine eyes thou hast set; and in my ear\rVented much policy, and projects deep\rOf enemies, of aids, battels and leagues,\rPlausible to the world, to me worth naught.\rMeans I must use thou say'st, prediction else\rWill unpredict and fail me of the Throne:\rMy time I told thee, (and that time for thee\rWere better farthest off) is not yet come,;\rWhen that comes think not thou to find me slack\rOn my part aught endeavouring, or to need\rThy politic maxims, or that cumbersome\rLuggage of war there shewn me, argument\rOf human weakness rather then of strength.\rMy brethren, as thou call'st them; those Ten Tribes\rI must deliver, if I mean to raign\rDavid\r's true heir, and his full Scepter sway\rTo just extent over all\rIsrael\r's Sons;\rBut whence to thee this zeal, where was it then\rFor\rIsrael\r, or for\rDavid\r, or his Throne,\rWhen thou stood'st up his Tempter to the pride\rOf numbring\rIsrael\r, which cost the lives\rOf threescore and ten thousand\rIsraelites\rBy three days Pestilence? such was thy zeal\rTo\rIsrael\rthen, the same that now to me.\rAs for those captive Tribes, themselves were they\rWho wrought their own captivity, fell off\rFrom God to worship Calves, the Deities\rOf\rEgypt\r,\rBaal\rnext and\rAshtaroth\r,\rAnd all the Idolatries of Heathen round,\rBesides thir other worse then heathenish crimes;\rNor in the land of their captivity\rHumbled themselves, or penitent besought\rThe God of their fore-fathers; but so dy'd\rImpenitent, and left a race behind\rLike to themselves, distinguishable scarce\rFrom\rGentils\r, but by Circumcision vain,\rAnd God with Idols in their worship joyn'd.\rShould I of these the liberty regard,\rWho freed, as to their antient Patrimony,\rUnhumbl'd, unrepentant, unreform'd, >\rHeadlong would follow; and to thir Gods perhaps\rOf\rBethel\rand of\rDan\r? no, let them serve\rThir enemies, who serve Idols with God.\rYet he at length, time to himself best known,\rRemembring\rAbraham\rby some wond'rous call\rMay bring them back repentant and sincere,\rAnd at their passing cleave the\rAssyrian\rflood,\rWhile to their native land with joy they hast,\rAs the\rRed Sea\rand\rJordan\ronce he cleft,\rWhen to the promis'd land thir Fathers pass'd;\rTo his due time and providence I leave them.\rSo spake\rIsrael\r's true King, and to the Fiend\rMade answer meet, that made void all his wiles.\rSo fares it when with truth falshood contends.\rThe End of the Third Book.\rPARADISE REGAIN'D\r. The Fourth BOOK.\rPErplex'd and troubl'd at his bad success\rThe Tempter stood, nor had what to reply,\rDiscover'd in his fraud, thrown from his hope,\rSo oft, and the perswasive Rhetoric\rThat sleek't his tongue, and won so much on\rEve\r,\rSo little here, nay lost; but\rEve\rwas\rEve\r,\rThis far his over-match, who self deceiv'd\rAnd rash, before-hand had no better weigh'd\rThe strength he was to cope with, or his own:\rBut as a man who had been matchless held\rIn cunning, over-reach't where least he thought,\rTo salve his credit, and for very spight\rStill will be tempting him who foyls him still,\rAnd never cease, though to his shame the more;\rOr as a swarm of flies in vintage time,\rAbout the wine-press where sweet moust is powr'd,\rBeat off, returns as oft with humming sound;\rOr surging waves against a solid rock,\rThough all to shivers dash't, the assault renew,\rVain battry, and in froth or bubbles end;\rSo\rSatan\r, whom repulse upon repulse\rMet ever; and to shameful silence brought,\rYet gives not o're though desperate of success,\rAnd his vain importunity pursues.\rHe brought our Saviour to the western side\rOf that high mountain, whence he might behold\rAnother plain, long but in bredth not wide;\rWash'd by the Southern Sea, and on the North\rTo equal length back'd with a ridge of hills\rThat screen'd the fruits of the earth and seats of men\rFrom cold\rSeptentrion\rblasts, thence in the midst\rDivided by a river, of whose banks\rOn each side an Imperial City stood,\rWith Towers and Temples proudly elevate\rOn seven small Hills, with Palaces adorn'd,\rPorches and Theatres, Baths, Aqueducts,\rStatues and Trophees, and Triumphal Arcs,\rGardens and Groves presented to his eyes,\rAbove the highth of Mountains interpos'd.\rBy what strange Parallax or Optic skill\rOf vision multiplyed through air, or glass\rOf Telescope, were curious to enquire:\rAnd now the Tempter thus his silence broke.\rThe City which thou seest no other deem\rThen great and glorious\rRome\r, Queen of the Earth\rSo far renown'd, and with the spoils enricht\rOf Nations;

these two Thrones except,\rThe rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight,\rShar'd among petty Kings too far remov'd;\rThese having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all\rThe Kingdoms of the world, and all thir glory.\rThis Emperour hath no Son, and now is old,\rOld, and lascivious, and from\rRome\rretir'd\rTo\rCapre\xc2\xbe\ran Island small but strong\rOn the\rCampanian\rshore, with purpose there\rHis horrid lusts in private to enjoy,\rCommitting to a wicked Favourite\rAll publick cares, and yet of him suspicious,\rHated of all, and hating; with what ease\rIndu'd with Regal Vertues as thou art,\rAppearing, and beginning noble deeds,\rMight'st thou expel this monster from his Throne\rNow made a stye, and in his place ascending\rA victor, people free from servile yoke?\rAnd with my help thou may'st;

though thou should'st add to tell\rThir sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts\rOn\rCittron\rtables or\rAtlantic\rstone;\r(For I have also heard, perhaps have read)\rTheir wines of\rSetia\r,\rCales\r, and\rFalerne\r,\rChios\rand\rCreet\r, and how they quaff in Gold,\rCrystal and Myrrhine cups imboss'd with Gems\rAnd studs of Pearl, to me should'st tell who thirst\rAnd hunger still: then Embassies thou shew'st\rFrom Nations far and nigh; what honour that,\rBut tedious wast of time to sit and hear\rSo many hollow complements and lies,\rOutlandish flatteries? then proceed'st to talk\rOf the Emperour, how easily subdu'd,\rHow gloriously; I shall, thou say'st, expel\rA brutish monster: what if I withal\rExpel a Devil who first made him such?\rLet his tormenter Conscience find him out,\rFor him I was not sent, nor yet to free\rThat people victor once, now vile and base,\rDeservedly made vassal, who once just,\rFrugal, and mild, and temperate, conquer'd well,\rBut govern ill the Nations under yoke,\rPeeling thir Provinces, exhausted all\rBy lust and rapine; first ambitious grown\rOf triumph that insulting vanity;\rThen cruel, by thir sports to blood enur'd\rOf fighting beasts, and men to beasts expos'd,\rLuxurious by thir wealth, and greedier still,\rAnd from the daily Scene effeminate.\rWhat wise and valiant man would seek to free\rThese thus degenerate, by themselves enslav'd,\rOr could of inward slaves make outward free?\rKnow therefore when my season comes to sit\rOn\rDavid\r's Throne, it shall be like a tree\rSpreading and over-shadowing all the Earth,\rOr as a stone that shall to pieces dash\rAll Monarchies besides throughout the world,\rAnd of my Kingdom there shall be no end:\rMeans there shall be to this, but what the means,\rIs not for thee to know, nor me to tell.\rTo whom the Tempter impudent repli'd.\rI see all offers made by me how slight\rThou valu'st, because offer'd, and reject'st:\rNothing will please the difficult and nice,\rOr nothing more then still to contradict:\rOn the other side know also thou, that I\rOn what I offer set as high esteem,\rNor what I part with mean to give for naught;\rAll these which in a moment thou behold'st,\rThe Kingdoms of the world to thee I give;\rFor giv'n to me, I give to whom I please,\rNo trifle; yet with this reserve, not else,\rOn this condition, if thou wilt fall down,\rAnd worship me as thy superior Lord,\rEasily done, and hold them all of me;\rFor what can less so great a gift deserve?\rWhom thus our Saviour answer'd with disdain.\rI never lik'd thy talk, thy offers less,\rNow both abhor, since thou hast dar'd to utter\rThe abominable terms, impious condition;\rBut I endure the time, till which expir'd,\rThou hast permission on me. It is written\rThe first of all Commandments, Thou shalt worship\rThe Lord thy God, and only him shalt serve;\rAnd dar'st thou to the Son of God propound\rTo worship thee accurst, now more accurst\rFor this attempt bolder then that on Eve,\rAnd more blasphemous? which expect to rue.\rThe Kingdoms of the world to thee were giv'n,\rPermitted rather, and by thee usurp't,\rOther donation none thou canst produce:\rIf given, by whom but by the King of Kings,\rGod over all supreme? if giv'n to thee,\rBy thee how fairly is the Giver now\rRepaid? But gratitude in thee is lost\rLong since. Wert thou so void of fear or shame,\rAs offer them to me the Son of God,\rTo me my own, on such abhorred pact,\rThat I fall down and worship thee as God?\rGet thee behind me; plain thou now appear'st\rThat Evil one,\rSatan\rfor ever damn'd.\rTo whom the Fiend with fear abasht reply'd.\rBe not so sore offended, Son of God;\rThough Sons of God both Angels are and Men,\rIf I to try whether in higher sort\rThen these thou bear'st that title, have propos'd\rWhat both from Men and Angels I receive,\rTetrarchs of fire, air, flood, and on the earth\rNations besides from all the quarter'd winds,\rGod of this world invok't and world beneath;\rWho then thou art, whose coming is foretold\rTo me so fatal, me it most concerns.\rThe tryal hath indamag'd thee no way,\rRather more honour left and more esteem;\rMe naught advantag'd, missing what I aim'd.\rTherefore let pass, as they are transitory,\rThe Kingdoms of this world; I shall no more\rAdvise thee, gain them as thou canst, or not.\rAnd thou thy self seem'st otherwise inclin'd\rThen to a worldly Crown, addicted more\rTo contemplation and profound dispute,\rAs by that early action may be judg'd,\rWhen slipping from thy Mothers eye thou went'st\rAlone into the Temple; there was found\rAmong the gravest Rabbies disputant\rOn points and questions fitting\rMoses\rChair,\rTeaching not taught; the childhood shews the man, >\rAs morning shews the day. Be famous then\rBy wisdom; as thy Empire must extend,\rSo let extend thy mind o're all the world,\rIn knowledge, all things in it comprehend,\rAll knowledge is not couch't in\rMoses\rLaw,\rThe\rPentateuch\ror what the Prophets wrote,\rThe\rGentiles\ralso know, and write, and teach\rTo admiration, led by Natures light;\rAnd with the\rGentiles\rmuch thou must converse,\rRuling them by perswasion as thou mean'st,\rWithout thir learning how wilt thou with them,\rOr they with thee hold conversation meet?\rHow wilt thou reason with them, how refute\rThir Idolisms, Traditions, Paradoxes?\rError by his own arms is best evinc't.\rLook once more e're we leave this specular Mount\rWestward, much nearer by Southwest, behold\rWhere on the \xc2\xaegean shore a City stands\rBuilt nobly, pure the air, and light the soil,\rAthens\rthe eye of\rGreece\r, Mother of Arts\rAnd Eloquence, native to famous wits\rOr hospitable, in her sweet recess,\rCity or Suburban, studious walks and shades;\rSee there the Olive Grove of\rAcademe\r,\rPlato\r's retirement, where the\rAttic\rBird\rTrills her thick-warbl'd notes the summer long,\rThere flowrie hill\rHymettus\rwith the sound\rOf Bees industrious murmur oft invites\rTo studious musing; there\rIlissus\rrouls\rHis whispering stream; within the walls then view\rThe schools of antient Sages; his who bred\rGreat\rAlexander\rto subdue the world,\rLyceum\rthere, and painted\rStoa\rnext:\rThere thou shalt hear and learn the secret power\rOf harmony in tones and numbers hit\rBy voice or hand, and various-measur'd verse,\r\xc2\xaeolian\rcharms and\rDorian\rLyric\rOdes,\rAnd his who gave them breath, but higher sung,\rBlind\rMelesigenes\rthence\rHomer\rcall'd,\rWhose Poem\rPh\xc3\x8fbus\rchalleng'd for his own.\rThence what the lofty grave Trag\xc3\x8fdians taught\rIn\rChorus\ror\rIambic\r, teachers best\rOf moral prudence, with delight receiv'd\rIn brief sententious precepts, while they treat\rOf fate, and chance, and change in human life;\rHigh actions, and high passions best describing:\rThence to the famous Orators repair,\rThose antient, whose resistless eloquence\rWielded at will that fierce Democratie,\rShook the Arsenal and fulmin'd over\rGreece\r,\rTo\rMacedon\r, and\rArtaxerxes\rThrone;\rTo sage Philosophy next lend thine ear,\rFrom Heaven descended to the low-rooft house\rOf\rSocrates\r, see there his Tenement,\rWhom well inspir'd the Oracle pronounc'd\rWisest of men; from whose mouth issu'd forth\rMellifluous streams that water'd all the schools\rOf Academics old and new, with those\rSirnam'd\rPeripatetics\r, and the Sect\rEpicurean\r, and the\rStoic\rsevere;\rThese here revolve, or, as thou lik'st, at home,\rTill time mature thee to a Kingdom's waight;\rThese rules will render thee a King compleat\rWithin thy self, much more with Empire joyn'd.\rTo whom our Saviour sagely thus repli'd.\rThink not but that I know these things, or think\rI know them not; not therefore am I short\rOf knowing what I aught: he who receives\rLight from above, from the fountain of light,\rNo other doctrine needs, though granted true;\rBut these are false, or little else but dreams,\rConjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm.\rThe first and wisest of them all profess'd\rTo know this only, that he nothing knew;\rThe next to fabling fell and smooth conceits,\rA third sort doubted all things, though plain sence;\rOthers in vertue plac'd felicity,\rBut vertue joyn'd with riches and long life,\rIn corporal pleasure he, and careless ease,\rThe\rStoic\rlast in Philosophic pride,\rBy him call'd vertue; and his vertuous man,\rWise, perfect in himself, and all possessing\rEqual to God, oft shames not to prefer,\rAs fearing God nor man, contemning all\rWealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life,\rWhich when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can,\rFor all his tedious talk is but vain boast,\rOr subtle shifts conviction to evade.\rAlas what can they teach, and not mislead;\rIgnorant of themselves, of God much more,\rAnd how the world began, and how man fell\rDegraded by himself, on grace depending?\rMuch of the Soul they talk, but all awrie,\rAnd in themselves seek vertue, and to themselves\rAll glory arrogate, to God give none,\rRather accuse him under usual names,\rFortune and Fate, as one regardless quite\rOf mortal things. Who therefore seeks in these\rTrue wisdom, finds her not, or by delusion\rFar worse, her false resemblance only meets,\rAn empty cloud. However many books\rWise men have said are wearisom; who reads\rIncessantly, and to his reading brings not\rA spirit and judgment equal or superior,\r(And what he brings, what needs he elsewhere seek)\rUncertain and unsettl'd still remains,\rDeep verst in books and shallow in himself,\rCrude or intoxicate, collecting toys,\rAnd trifles for choice matters, worth a spunge;\rAs Children gathering pibles\rthe i of pibles is set in Italic\ron the shore.\rOr if I would delight my private hours\rWith Music or with Poem, where so soon\rAs in our native Language can I find\rThat solace?

Darkness now rose,\rAs day-light sunk, and brought in lowring night\rHer shadowy off-spring unsubstantial both,\rPrivation meer of light and absent day.\rOur Saviour meek and with untroubl'd mind\rAfter his aerie jaunt, though hurried sore,\rHungry and cold betook him to his rest,\rWherever, under some concourse of shades\rWhose branching arms thick intertwind might shield\rFrom dews and damps of night his shelter'd head,\rBut shelter'd slept in vain, for at his head\rThe Tempter watch'd, and soon with ugly dreams\rDisturb'd his sleep; and either Tropic now\rGan thunder, and both ends of Heav'n, the Clouds\rFrom many a horrid rift abortive pour'd\rFierce rain with lightning mixt, water with fire\rIn ruine reconcil'd: nor slept the winds\rWithin thir stony caves, but rush'd abroad\rFrom the four hinges of the world, and fell\rOn the vext Wilderness, whose tallest Pines,\rThough rooted deep as high, and sturdiest Oaks\rBow'd their Stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts,\rOr torn up sheer: ill wast thou shrouded then,\rO patient Son of God, yet only stoodst\rUnshaken; nor yet staid the terror there,\rInfernal Ghosts, and Hellish Furies, round\rEnviron'd thee, some howl'd, some yell'd, some shriek'd,\rSome bent at thee thir\rsome copies have their\rfiery darts, while thou\rSat'st unappall'd in calm and sinless peace.\rThus pass'd the night so foul till morning fair\rCame forth with Pilgrim steps in amice gray;\rWho with her radiant finger still'd the roar\rOf thunder, chas'd the clouds, and laid the winds,\rAnd grisly Spectres, which the Fiend had rais'd\rTo tempt the Son of God with terrors dire.\rAnd now the Sun with more effectual beams\rHad chear'd the face of Earth, and dry'd the wet\rFrom drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds\rWho all things now behold more fresh and green,\rAfter a night of storm so ruinous,\rClear'd up their choicest notes in bush and spray\rTo gratulate the sweet return of morn;\rNor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn\rWas absent, after all his mischief done,\rThe Prince of darkness, glad would also seem\rOf this fair change, and to our Saviour came,\rYet with no new device, they all were spent,\rRather by this his last affront resolv'd,\rDesperate of better course, to vent his rage,\rAnd mad despight to be so oft repell'd.\rHim walking on a Sunny hill he found,\rBack'd on the North and West by a thick wood,\rOut of the wood he starts in wonted shape;\rAnd in a careless mood thus to him said.\rFair morning yet betides thee Son of God,\rAfter a dismal night; I heard the rack\rAs Earth and Skie would mingle; but my self\rWas distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them\rAs dangerous to the pillard frame of Heaven,\rOr to the Earths dark basis underneath,\rAre to the main as inconsiderable,\rAnd harmless, if not wholsom, as a sneeze\rTo mans less universe, and soon are gone;\rYet as being oft times noxious where they light\rOn man, beast, plant, wastful and turbulent,\rLike turbulencies in the affairs of men,\rOver whose heads they rore, and seem to point,\rThey oft fore-signifie and threaten ill:\rThis Tempest at this Desert most was bent;\rOf men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st.\rDid I not tell thee, if thou didst reject\rThe perfet season offer'd with my aid\rTo win thy destin'd seat, but wilt prolong\rAll to the push of Fate, persue thy way\rOf gaining\rDavid\r's Throne no man knows when,\rFor both the when and how is no where told,\rThou shalt be what thou art ordain'd, no doubt;\rFor Angels have proclaim'd it, but concealing\rThe time and means: each act is rightliest done,\rNot when it must, but when it may be best.\rIf thou observe not this, be sure to find,\rWhat I foretold thee, many a hard assay\rOf dangers, and adversities and pains,\rE're thou of\rIsrael\r's Scepter get fast hold;\rWhereof this ominous night that clos'd thee round,\rSo many terrors, voices, prodigies\rMay warn thee, as a sure fore-going sign.\rSo talk'd he, while the Son of God went on\rAnd staid not, but in brief him answer'd thus.\rMee worse then wet thou find'st not; other harm\rThose terrors which thou speak'st of, did me none;\rsome copies have no ;\rI never fear'd they could, though noising loud\rAnd threatning nigh; what they can do as signs\rBetok'ning, or ill boding, I contemn\rAs false portents, not sent from God, but thee;\rWho knowing I shall raign past thy preventing,\rObtrud'st thy offer'd aid, that I accepting\rAt least might seem to hold all power of thee,\rAmbitious spirit, and wouldst be thought my God,\rAnd storm'st refus'd, thinking to terrifie\rMee to thy will; desist, thou\rsome copies have will desist; thou\rart discern'd\rAnd toil'st in vain, nor me in vain molest.\rTo whom the Fiend now swoln with rage reply'd:\rThen hear, O Son of\rDavid\r, Virgin-born;\rFor Son of God to me is yet in doubt,\rOf the Messiah I have heard foretold\rBy all the Prophets; of thy birth at length\rAnnounc't by\rGabriel\rwith the first I knew,\rAnd of the Angelic Song in\rBethlehem\rfield,\rOn thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born.\rFrom that time seldom have I ceas'd to eye\rThy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth,\rThy manhood last, though yet in private bred;\rTill at the Ford of\rJordan\rwhither all\rFlock'd to the Baptist, I among the rest,\rThough not to be Baptiz'd, by voice from Heav'n\rHeard thee pronounc'd the Son of God belov'd.\rThenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view\rAnd narrower Scrutiny, that I might learn\rIn what degree or meaning thou art call'd\rThe Son of God, which bears no single sence;\rThe Son of God I also am, or was,\rAnd if I was, I am; relation stands;\rAll men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought\rIn some respect far higher so declar'd.\rTherefore I watch'd thy footsteps from that hour,\rAnd follow'd thee still on to this wast wild;\rWhere by all best conjectures I collect\rThou art to be my fatal enemy.\rGood reason then, if I before-hand seek\rTo understand my Adversary, who\rAnd what he is; his wisdom, power, intent,\rBy parl, or composition, truce, or league\rTo win him, or win from him what I can.\rAnd opportunity I here have had\rTo try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee\rProof against all temptation as a rock\rOf Adamant, and as a Center, firm\rTo the utmost of meer man both wise and good,\rNot more; for Honours, Riches, Kingdoms, Glory\rHave been before contemn'd, and may agen:\rTherefore to know what more thou art then man,\rWorth naming Son of God by voice from Heav'n,\rAnother method I must now begin.\rSo saying he caught him up, and without wing\rOf\rHippogrif\rbore through the Air sublime\rOver the Wilderness and o're the Plain;\rTill underneath them fair\rJerusalem\r,\rThe holy City lifted high her Towers,\rAnd higher yet the glorious Temple rear'd\rHer pile, far off appearing like a Mount\rOf Alabaster, top't with Golden Spires:\rThere on the highest Pinacle he set\rThe Son of God; and added thus in scorn:\rThere stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright\rWill ask thee skill; I to thy Fathers house\rHave brought thee, and highest plac't, highest is best,\rNow shew thy Progeny; if not to stand,\rCast thy self down; safely if Son of God:\rFor it is written, He will give command\rConcerning thee to his Angels, in thir hands\rThey shall up lift thee, lest at any time\rThou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.\rTo whom thus\rJesus\r:\ralso it is written,\rTempt not the Lord thy God,\rhe said and stood.\rBut\rSatan\rsmitten with amazement fell\rAs when Earths Son\rAnt\xc2\xbeus\r(to compare\rSmall things with greatest) in\rIrassa\rstrove\rWith\rJoves Alcides\r,\rno comma in some copies\rand oft foil'd still rose,\rReceiving from his mother Earth new strength,\rFresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joyn'd,\rThrottl'd at length in the Air, expir'd and fell;\rSo after many a foil the Tempter proud,\rRenewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride\rFell whence he stood to see his Victor fall.\rAnd as that\rTheban\rMonster that propos'd\rHer riddle, and him, who solv'd it not, devour'd;\rThat once found out and solv'd, for grief and spight\rCast her self headlong from th'\rIsmenian\rsteep,\rSo strook with dread and anguish fell the Fiend,\rAnd to his crew, that sat consulting, brought\rJoyless triumphals\rsome copies have tryumphals\rof his hop't success,\rRuin, and desperation, and dismay,\rWho durst so proudly tempt the Son of God.\rSo\rSatan\rfell and strait a fiery Globe\rOf Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh,\rWho on their plumy Vans receiv'd him soft\rFrom his uneasie station, and upbore\rAs on a floating couch through the blithe Air,\rThen in a flowry valley set him down\rOn a green bank, and set before him spred\rA table of Celestial Food, Divine,\rAmbrosial, Fruits fetcht from the tree of life,\rAnd from the fount of life Ambrosial drink,\rThat soon refresh'd him wearied, and repair'd\rWhat hunger, if aught hunger had impair'd,\rOr thirst, and as he fed, Angelic Quires\rSung Heavenly Anthems of his victory\rOver temptation, and the Tempter proud.\rTrue Image of the Father whether thron'd\rIn the bosom of bliss, and light of light\rConceiving,\rsome copies omit the comma\ror remote from Heaven, enshrin'd\rIn fleshly Tabernacle, and human form,\rWandring the Wilderness, whatever place,\rHabit, or state, or motion, still expressing\rThe Son of God, with Godlike force indu'd\rAgainst th' Attempter of thy Fathers Throne,\rAnd Thief of\rParadise\r; him long of old\rThou didst debel, and down from Heav'n cast\rWith all his Army, now thou hast aveng'd\rSupplanted\rAdam\r, and by vanquishing\rTemptation, hast regain'd lost\rParadise\r,\rAnd frustrated the conquest fraudulent:\rHe never more henceforth will dare set foot\rIn\rParadise\rto tempt;

Poet. Cap. 6.\rTrag\xc3\x8fdia est imitatio actionis serie\xc2\xbe, &c. Per misericordiam & metum perficiens talium affectuum lustrationem.\rLONDON, Printed by J.M. for\rJohn Starkey\rat the\rMitre\rin\rFleetstreet\r, near\rTemple-Bar.\rMDCLXXI.\rOf that sort of Dramatic Poem which is call'd Tragedy.\rTRagedy, as it was antiently compos'd, hath been ever held the gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other Poems: therefore said by\rAristotle\rto be of power by raising pity and fear, or terror, to purge the mind of those and such like passions, that is to temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight, stirr'd up by reading or seeing those passions well imitated. Nor is Nature wanting in her own effects to make good his assertion: for so in Physic things of melancholic hue and quality are us'd against melancholy, sowr against sowr, salt to remove salt humours. Hence Philosophers and other gravest Writers, as\rCicero\r,\rPlutarch\rand others, frequently cite out of Tragic Poets, both to adorn and illustrate thir discourse. The Apostle\rPaul\rhimself thought it not unworthy to insert a verse of\rEuripedes\rinto the Text of Holy Scripture,\rI\rCor.\r15.33.\rand\rPar\xc2\xbeus\rcommenting on the\rRevelation\r, divides the whole Book as a Tragedy, into Acts distinguisht each by a Chorus of Heavenly Harpings and Song between. Heretofore\rMen in highest dignity have labour'd not a little to be thought able to compose a Tragedy. Of that honour\rDionysius\rthe elder was no less ambitious, then before of his attaining to the Tyranny.\rAugustus C\xc2\xbesar\ralso had begun his\rAjax\r, but unable to please his own judgment with what he had begun, left it unfinisht.\rSeneca\rthe Philosopher is by some thought the Author of those Tragedies (at lest the best of them) that go under that name.\rGregory Nazianzen\ra Father of the Church, thought it not unbeseeming the sanctity of his person to write a Tragedy, which he entitl'd,\rChrist suffering\r. This is mention'd to vindicate Tragedy from the small esteem, or rather infamy, which in the account of many it undergoes at this day with other common Interludes; hap'ning through the Poets error of intermixing Comic stuff with Tragic sadness and gravity; or introducing trivial and vulgar persons, which by all judicious hath bin counted absurd; and brought in without discretion, corruptly to gratifie the people. And though antient Tragedy use no Prologue, yet using sometimes, in case of self defence, or explanation, that which\rMartial\rcalls an Epistle; in behalf of this Tragedy coming forth after the antient manner, much different from what among us passes for best, thus much before-hand may be Epistl'd; that\rChorus\ris here introduc'd after the Greek manner, not antient only but modern, and still in use among the\rItalians\r. In the modelling therefore of this Poem, with good reason, the Antients and\rItalians\rare rather follow'd, as of much more authority and fame. The measure of Verse us'd in the Chorus is of all sorts, call'd by the Greeks\rMonostrophic\r, or rather\rApolelymenon\r, without regard had to\rStrophe\r,\rAntistrophe\ror\rEpod\r, which were a kind of Stanza's fram'd only for the Music, then us'd with the Chorus that sung; not essential to the Poem, and therefore not material; or being divided into Stanza's or Pauses, they may be call'd\rAll\xc2\xbeostropha\r. Division into Act and Scene referring chiefly to the Stage (to which this work never was intended) is here omitted.\rIt suffices if the whole Drama be found not produc't beyond the fift Act, of the style and uniformitie, and that commonly call'd the Plot, whether intricate or explicit, which is nothing indeed but such \xc3\x8fconomy, or disposition of the fable as may stand best with verisimilitude and decorum; they only will best judge who are not unacquainted with\r\xc2\xaeschulus\r,\rSophocles\r, and\rEuripedes\r, the three Tragic Poets unequall'd yet by any, and the best rule to all who endeavour to write Tragedy. The circumscription of time wherein the whole Drama begins and ends, is according to antient rule, and best example, within the space of 24 hours.\rThe ARGUMENT.\rSAmson\rmade Captive, Blind, and now in the Prison at\rGaza,\rthere to labour as in a common work-house, on a Festival day, in the general cessation from labour, comes forth into the open Air, to a place nigh, somewhat retir'd there to sit a while and bemoan his condition. Where he happens at length to be visited by certain friends and equals of his tribe, which make the Chorus, who seek to comfort him what they can; then by his old Father\rManoa,\rwho endeavours the like, and withal tells him his purpose to procure his liberty by ransom; lastly, that this Feast was proclaim'd by the\rPhilistins\ras a day of Thanksgiving for thir deliverance from the hands of\rSamson,\rwhich yet more troubles him\rManoa\rthen departs to prosecute his endeavour with the\rPhilistian\rLords for\rSamson's\rredemption; who in the mean while is visited by other persons; and lastly by a publick Officer to require his coming to the Feast before the Lords and People, to play or shew his strength in thir presence; he at first refuses, dismissing the publick Officer with absolute denyal to come; at length perswaded inwardly that this was from God, he yields to go along with him, who came now the second time with great threatnings to fetch him; the Chorus yet remaining on the place,\rManoa\rreturns full of joyful hope, to procure e're long his Sons deliverance: in the midst of which discourse an Ebrew comes in haste confusedly at first; and afterward more distinctly relating the Catastrophe, what\rSamson\rhad done to the\rPhilistins,\rand by accident to himself; wherewith the Tragedy ends.\rThe Persons.\rSamson.\rManoa\rthe Father of\rSamson.\rDalila\rhis Wife\r.\rHarapha\rof\rGath.\rPublick Officer.\rMessenger.\rChorus\rof\rDanites.\rThe Scene before the Prison in\rGaza\r.\rSAMSON Agonistes.\rA little onward lend thy guiding hand\rTo these dark steps, a little further on;\rFor yonder bank hath choice of Sun or shade,\rThere I am wont to sit, when any chance\rRelieves me from my task of servile toyl,\rDaily in the common Prison else enjoyn'd me,\rWhere I a Prisoner chain'd, scarce freely draw\rThe air imprison'd also, close and damp,\rUnwholsom draught: but here I feel amends,\rThe breath of Heav'n fresh-blowing, pure and sweet,\rWith day-spring born; here leave me to respire.\rThis day a solemn Feast the people hold\rTo\rDagon\rthir Sea-Idol, and forbid\rLaborious works, unwillingly this rest\rThir Superstition yields me; hence with leave\rRetiring from the popular noise, I seek\rThis unfrequented place to find some ease,\rEase to the body some, none to the mind\rFrom restless thoughts, that like a deadly swarm\rOf Hornets arm'd, no sooner found alone,\rBut rush upon me thronging, and present\rTimes past, what once I was, and what am now.\rO wherefore was my birth from Heaven foretold\rTwice by an Angel, who at last in sight\rOf both my Parents all in flames ascended\rFrom off the Altar, where an Off'ring burn'd,\rAs in a fiery column charioting\rHis Godlike presence, and from some great act,\rOr benefit reveal'd to\rAbraham\r's race?\rWhy was my breeding order'd and prescrib'd\rAs of a person separate to God,\rDesign'd for great exploits; if I must dye\rBetray'd, Captiv'd, and both my Eyes put out,\rMade of my Enemies the scorn and gaze;\rTo grind in Brazen Fetters under task\rWith this Heav'n-gifted strength? O glorious strength\rPut to the labour of a Beast, debas't\rLower than bondslave! Promise was that I\rShould\rIsrael\rfrom\rPhilistian\ryoke deliver;\rAsk for this great Deliverer now, and find him\rEyeless in\rGaza\rat the Mill with slaves,\rHimself in bonds under\rPhilistian\ryoke;\rYet stay, let me not rashly call in doubt\rDivine Prediction; what if all foretold\rHad been fulfilld but through mine own default,\rWhom have I to complain of but my self?\rWho this high gift of strength committed to me,\rIn what part lodg'd, how easily bereft me,\rUnder the Seal of silence could not keep,\rBut weakly to a woman must reveal it,\rO'ercome with importunity and tears.\rO impotence of mind, in body strong!\rBut what is strength without a double share\rOf wisdom, vast, unwieldy, burdensom,\rProudly secure, yet liable to fall\rBy weakest suttleties, not made to rule,\rBut to subserve where wisdom bears command.\rGod, when he gave me strength, to shew withal\rHow slight the gift was, hung it in my Hair.\rBut peace, I must not quarrel with the will\rOf highest dispensation, which herein\rHapp'ly had ends above my reach to know:\rSuffices that to me strength is my bane,\rAnd proves the sourse of all my miseries;\rSo many, and so huge, that each apart\rWould ask a life to wail, but chief of all,\rO loss of sight, of thee I most complain!\rBlind among enemies, O worse then chains,\rDungeon, or beggery, or decrepit age!\rLight the prime work of God to me is extinct\rAnd all her various objects of delight\rAnnull'd, which might in part my grief have eas'd,\rInferiour to the vilest now become\rOf man or worm; the vilest here excel me,\rThey creep, yet see, I dark in light expos'd\rTo daily fraud, contempt, abuse and wrong,\rWithin door, or without, still as a fool,\rIn power of others, never in my own;\rScarce half I seem to live, dead more then half.\rO dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,\rIrrecoverably dark, total Eclipse\rWithout all hope of day!\rO first created Beam, and thou great Word,\rLet there be light, and light was over all;\rWhy am I thus bereav'd thy prime decree?\rThe Sun to me is dark\rAnd silent as the Moon,\rWhen she deserts the night\rHid in her vacant interlunar cave.\rSince light so necessary is to life,\rAnd almost life it self, if it be true\rThat light is in the Soul,\rShe all in every part; why was the sight\rTo such a tender ball as th'eye confin'd?\rSo obvious and so easie to be quench't,\rAnd not as feeling through all parts diffus'd,\rThat she might look at will through every pore?\rThen had I not been thus exil'd from light;\rAs in the land of darkness yet in light,\rTo live a life half dead, a living death\rAnd buried; but O yet more miserable!\rMy self, my Sepulcher, a moving Grave,\rBuried, yet not exempt\rBy priviledge of death and burial\rFrom worst of other evils, pains and wrongs,\rBut made hereby obnoxious more\rTo all the miseries of life,\rLife in captivity\rAmong inhuman foes.\rBut who are these? for with joint pace I hear\rThe tread of many feet stearing this way;\rPerhaps my enemies who come to stare\rAt my affliction, and perhaps to insult,\rThir daily practice to afflict me more.\rThis, this is he; softly a while,\rLet us not break in upon him;\rO change beyond report, thought, or belief!\rSee how he lies at random, carelessly diffus'd,\rWith languish't head unpropt,\rAs one past hope, abandon'd,\rAnd by himself given over;\rIn slavish habit, ill-fitted weeds\rO're worn and soild;\rOr do my eyes misrepresent?

Yee see, O friends,\rHow many evils have enclos'd me round;\rYet that which was the worst now least afflicts me,\rBlindness, for had I sight, confus'd with shame,\rHow could I once look up, or heave the head,\rWho like a foolish Pilot have shipwrack't,\rMy Vessel trusted to me from above,\rGloriously rigg'd; and for a word, a tear,\rFool, have divulg'd the secret gift of God\rTo a deceitful Woman: tell me Friends,\rAm I not sung and proverbd for a Fool\rIn every street, do they not say, how well\rAre come upon him his deserts? yet why?\rImmeasurable strength they might behold\rIn me, of wisdom nothing more then mean;\rThis with the other shouldould, at least, have paird,\rThese two proportiond ill drove me transverse.\rTax not divine disposal, wisest Men\rHave err'd, and by bad Women been deceiv'd;\rAnd shall again, pretend they ne're so wise.\rDeject not then so overmuch they self,\rWho hast of sorrow thy full load besides;\rYet truth to say, I oft have heard men wonder\rWhy thou shouldst wed\rPhilistian\rwomen rather\rThen of thine own Tribe fairer, or as fair,\rAt least of thy own Nation, and as noble.\rThe first I saw at\rTimna\r, and she pleas'd\rMee, not my Parents, that I sought to wed,\rThe daughter of an Infidel: they knew not\rThat what I\rmotion'd\rwas of God; I knew\rFrom intimate impulse, and therefore urg'd\rThe Marriage on; that by occasion hence\rI might begin\rIsrael\r's Deliverance,\rThe work to which I was divinely call'd;\rShe proving false, the next I took to Wife\r(O that I never had!

O ever failing [trust]\rIn mortal strength! and oh what not in man\rDeceivable and vain! Nay what thing good\rPray'd for, but often proves our woe, our bane?\rI pray'd for Children, and thought barrenness\rIn wedlock a reproach; I gain'd a Son,\rAnd\rSuch a Son as Men hail'd me happy;\rWho would be now a Father in my stead?\rO wherefore did God grant me my request,\rAnd as a blessing with such pomp adorn'd?\rWhy are his gifts desirable, to tempt\rOur earnest Prayers, then giv'n with solemn hand\rAs Graces, draw a Scorpions tail behind?\rFor this did the Angel twice descend? for this\rOrdain'd thy nurture holy, as of a Plant;\rSelect, and Sacred, Glorious for a while,\rThe miracle of men: then in an hour\rEnsnar'd, assaulted, overcome, led bound,\rThy Foes derision, Captive, Poor, and Blind\rInto a Dungeon thrust, to work with Slaves?\rAlas methinks whom God hath chosen once\rTo worthiest deed, if he through frailty err,\rHe should not so o'rewhelm, and as a thrall\rSubject him to so foul indignities,\rBe it but for honours sake of former deeds.\rAppoint not heavenly disposition, Father,\rNothing of all these evils hath befall'n me\rBut justly; I my self have brought them on,\rSole Author I, sole cause; if aught seem vile,\rAs vile hath been my folly, who have profan'd\rThe mystery of God giv'n me under pledge\rOf vow, and have betray'd it to a woman,\rA\rCanaanite,\rmy faithless enemy.\rThis well I knew, nor was at all surpris'd,\rBut warn'd by oft experience: did not she\rOf\rTimna\rfirst betray me, and reveal\rThe secret wrested from me in her highth\rOf Nuptial Love profest, carrying it strait\rTo them who had corrupted her, my Spies,\rAnd Rivals? In this other was there found\rMore Faith? who also in her prime of love,\rSpousal embraces, vitiated with Gold,\rThough offer'd only, by the sent conceiv'd\rHer spurious first-born; Treason against me?\rThrice she assay'd with flattering prayers and sighs,\rAnd amorous reproaches to win from me\rMy capital secret, in what part my strength\rLay stor'd, in what part summ'd, that she might know:\rThrice I deluded her, and turn'd to sport\rHer importunity, each time perceiving\rHow openly, and with what impudence\rShe purpos'd to betray me, and (which was worse\rThen undissembl'd hate) with what contempt\rShe sought to make me Traytor to my self;\rYet the fourth time, when mustring all her wiles,\rWith blandisht parlies, feminine assaults,\rTongue-batteries, she surceas'd not day nor night\rTo storm me over-watch't, and wearied out.\rAt times when men seek most repose and rest,\rI yielded, and unlock'd her all my heart,\rWho with a grain of manhood well resolv'd\rMight easily have shook off all her snares:\rBut foul effeminacy held me yok't\rHer Bond-slave; O indignity, O blot\rTo Honour and Religion! servil mind\rRewarded well with servil punishment!\rThe base degree to which I now am fall'n,\rThese rags, this grinding, is not yet so base\rAs was my former servitude, ignoble,\rUnmanly, ignominious, infamous,\rTrue slavery, and that blindness worse then this,\rThat saw not how degeneratly I serv'd.\rI cannot praise thy Marriage choises, Son,\rRather approv'd them not; but thou didst plead\rDivine impulsion prompting how thou might'st\rFind some occasion to infest our Foes.\rI state not that; this I am sure; our Foes\rFound soon occasion thereby to make thee\rThir Captive, and thir triumph; thou the sooner\rTemptation found'st, or over-potent charms\rTo violate the sacred trust of silence\rDeposited within thee; which to have kept\rTacit, was in thy power; true; and thou bear'st\rEnough, and more the burden of that fault;\rBitterly hast thou paid, and still art paying\rThat rigid score. A worse thing yet remains,\rThis day the\rPhilistines\ra popular Feast\rHere celebrate in\rGaza;\rand proclaim\rGreat Pomp, and Sacrifice, and Praises loud\rTo\rDagon,\ras their God who hath deliver'd\rThee\rSamson\rbound and blind into thir hands,\rThem out of thine, who slew'st them many a slain.\rSo\rDagon\rshall be magnifi'd, and God,\rBesides whom is no God, compar'd with Idols,\rDisglorifi'd, blasphem'd, and had in scorn\rBy th'Idolatrous rout amidst thir wine;\rWhich to have come to pass by means of thee,\rSamson\r, of all thy sufferings think the heaviest,\rOf all reproach the most with shame that ever\rCould have befall'n thee and thy Fathers house.\rFather, I do acknowledge and confess\rThat I this honour, I this pomp have brought\rTo\rDagon,\rand advanc'd his praises high\rAmong the Heathen round; to God have brought\rDishonour, obloquie, and op't the mouths\rOf Idolists, and Atheists; have brought scandal\rTo\rIsrael,\rdiffidence of God, and doubt\rIn feeble hearts, propense anough before\rTo waver, or fall off and joyn with Idols;\rWhich is my chief affliction, shame and sorrow,\rThe anguish of my Soul, that suffers not\rMine eie to harbour sleep, or thought to rest.\rThis only hope relieves me, that the strife\rWith me hath end; all the contest is now\r'Twixt God and\rDagon; Dagon\rhath presum'd,\rMe overthrown, to enter lists with God,\rHis Deity comparing and preferring\rBefore the God of\rAbraham.\rHe, be sure,\rWill not connive, or linger, thus provok'd,\rBut will arise and his great name assert:\rDagon\rmust stoop, and shall e're long receive\rSuch a discomfit, as shall quite despoil him\rOf all these boasted Trophies won on me,\rAnd with confusion blank his Worshippers.\rWith cause this hope relieves thee, and these words\rI as a Prophecy receive: for God,\rNothing more certain, will not long defer\rTo vindicate the glory of his name\rAgainst all competition, nor will long\rEndure it, doubtful whether God be Lord,\rOr\rDagon.\rBut for thee what shall be done?\rThou must not in the mean while here forgot\rLie in this miserable loathsom plight\rNeglected. I already have made way\rTo some\rPhilistian\rLords, with whom to treat\rAbout thy ramsom: well they may by this\rHave satisfi'd thir utmost of revenge\rBy pains and slaveries, worse then death inflicted\rOn thee, who now no more canst do them harm.\rSpare that proposal, Father, spare the trouble\rOf that sollicitation; let me here,\rAs I deserve, pay on my punishment;\rAnd expiate, if possible, my crime,\rShameful garrulity. To have reveal'd\rSecrets of men, the secrets of a friend,\rHow hainous had the fact been, how deserving\rContempt, and scorn of all, to be excluded\rAll friendship, and avoided as a blab,\rThe mark of fool set on his front?\rBut I Gods counsel have not kept, his holy secret\rPresumptuously have publish'd, impiously,\rWeakly at least, and shamefully: A sin\rThat Gentiles in thir Parables condemn\rTo thir abyss and horrid pains confin'd.\rBe penitent and for thy fault contrite,\rBut act not in thy own affliction, Son,\rRepent the sin, but if the punishment\rThou canst avoid, self-preservation bids;\rOr th'execution leave to high disposal,\rAnd let another hand, not thine, exact\rThy penal forfeit from thy self; perhaps\rGod will relent, and quit thee all his debt;\rWho evermore approves and more accepts\r(Best pleas'd with humble and filial submission)\rHim who imploring mercy sues for life,\rThen who self-rigorous chooses death as due;\rWhich argues over-just, and self-displeas'd\rFor self-offence, more then for God offended.\rReject not then what offerd means, who knows\rBut God hath set before us, to return thee\rHome to thy countrey and his sacred house,\rWhere thou mayst bring thy off'rings, to avert\rHis further ire, with praiers and vows renew'd.\rHis pardon I implore; but as for life,\rTo what end should I seek it? when in strength\rAll mortals I excell'd, and great in hopes\rWith youthful courage and magnanimous thoughts\rOf birth from Heav'n foretold and high exploits,\rFull of divine instinct, after some proof\rOf acts indeed heroic, far beyond\rThe Sons of\rAnac,\rfamous now and blaz'd,\rFearless of danger, like a petty God\rI walk'd about admir'd of all and dreaded\rOn hostile ground, none daring my affront.\rThen swoll'n with pride into the snare I fell\rOf fair fallacious looks, venereal trains,\rSoftn'd with pleasure and voluptuous life;\rAt length to lay my head and hallow'd pledge\rOf all my strength in the lascivious lap\rOf a deceitful Concubine who shore me\rLike a tame Weather, all my precious fleece,\rThen turn'd me out ridiculous, despoil'd,\rShav'n, and disarm'd among my enemies.\rDesire of wine and all delicious drinks,\rWhich many a famous Warrior overturns,\rThou couldst repress, nor did the dancing Rubie\rSparkling, out-pow'rd, the flavor, or the smell,\rOr taste that cheers the heart of Gods and men,\rAllure thee from the cool Crystalline stream.\rWhere ever fountain or fresh current flow'd\rAgainst the Eastern ray, translucent, pure.\rWith touch \xc2\xbetherial of Heavn's fiery rod\rI drank, from the clear milkie juice allaying\rThirst, and refresht; nor envy'd them the grape\rWhose heads that turburlent liquor fills with fumes.\rSP\rChor.\r=CHO>O madness, to think use of strongest wines\rAnd strongest drinks our chief support of health,\rWhen God with these forbid'n made choice to rear\rHis mighty Champion, strong above compare,\rWhose drink was only from the liquid brook.\rBut what avail'd this temperance, not com- pleat\rAgainst another object more enticing?\rWhat boots it at one gate to make defence,\rAnd at another to let in the foe\rEffeminatly vanquis't? By which means,\rNow Blind, disheartn'd, sham'd, dishonour'd, quell'd,\rTo what can I be useful, wherein serve\rMy Nation, and the work from Heav'n impos'd,\rBut to sit idle on the houshold hearth,\rA burdenous drone; to visitants a gaze,\rOr pitied object, these redundant locks\rRobustious to no purpose clustring down,\rVain monument of strength; till length of years\rAnd the sedentary numness craze my limbs\rTo a contemptible old age obscure.\rHere rather let me drudge and earn my bread,\rTill vermin or the draff of servil food\rConsume me, and oft-invocated death\rHast'n the welcom end of all my pains.\rWilt thou then serve the\rPhilistines\rwith that gift\rWhich was expresly giv'n thee to annoy them?\rBetter at home lie bed-rid, not only idle,\rInglorious, unimploy'd, with age out-worn.\rBut God who caus'd a fountain at thy prayer\rFrom the dry ground to spring, thy thirst to allay\rAfter the brunt of battel, can as easie\rCause light again within thy eies to spring,\rWherewith to serve him better then thou hast;\rAnd I perswade me so; why else this strength\rMiraculous yet remaining in those locks?\rHis might continues in thee not for naught,\rNor shall his wondrous gifts be frustrate thus.\rAll otherwise to me my thoughts portend\rThat these dark orbs no more shall treat with light,\rNor th'other light of life continue long,\rBut yield to double darkness nigh at hand:\rSo much I feel my genial spirits droop,\rMy hopes all flat, nature within me seems\rIn all her functions weary of herself;\rMy race of glory run, and race of shame,\rAnd I shall shortly be with them that rest.\rBelieve not these suggestions which proceed\rFrom anguish of the mind and humours black,\rThat mingle with thy fancy. I however\rMust not omit a Fathers timely care\rTo prosecute the means of thy deliverance\rBy ransom or how else: mean while be calm,\rAnd healing words from these thy friends admit.\rO that torment should not be confin'd\rTo the bodies wounds and sores\rWith maladies innumerable\rIn heart, head, brest, and reins;\rBut must secret passage find\rTo th'inmost mind,\rThere exercise all his fierce accidents,\rAnd on her purest spirits prey,\rAs on entrails, joints, and limbs,\rWith answerable pains, but more intense,\rThough void of corporal sense.\rMy griefs not only pain me\rAs a lingring disease,\rBut finding no redress, ferment and rage,\rNor less then wounds immedicable\rRanckle, and fester, and gangrene,\rTo black mortification.\rThoughts my Tormenters arm'd with deadly stings\rMangle my apprehensive tenderest parts,\rExasperate, exulcerate, and raise,\rDire inflammation which no cooling herb\rOr medcinal liquor can asswage,\rNor breath of Vernal Air from Snowy\rAlp.\rSleep hath forsook and giv'n me o're\rTo deaths benumming Opium as my only\rThence faintings, swounings of despair,\rAnd sense of Heav'ns desertion.\rI was his nursling once and choice delight,\rHis destin'd from the womb,\rPromisd by Heavenly message twice descending.\rUnder his special eie\rAbstemious I grew up and thriv'd amain;\rHe led me on to mightiest deeds\rAbove the nerve of mortal arm\rAgainst the uncircumcis'd, our enemies.\rBut now hath cast me off as never known,\rAnd to those cruel enemies,\rWhom I by his appointment had provok't,\rLeft me all helpless with th'irreparable loss\rOf sight, reserv'd alive to be repeated\rThe subject of thir cruelty, or scorn.\rNor am I in the list of them that hope;\rHopeless are all my evils, all remediless;\rThis one prayer yet remains, might I be heard,\rNo long petition, speedy death,\rThe close of all my miseries, and the balm.\rMany are the sayings of the wise\rIn antient and in modern books enroll'd;\rExtolling Patience as the truest fortitude;\rAnd to the bearing well of all calamities,\rAll chances incident to mans frail life\rConsolatories writ\rWith studied argument, and much perswasion sought\rLenient of grief and anxious thought,\rBut\rwith\rth'afflicted in his pangs thir sound\rLittle prevails, or rather seems a tune,\rHarsh, and of dissonant mood from his complaint,\rUnless he feel within\rSome source of consolation from above;\rSecret refreshings, that repair his strength,\rAnd fainting spirits uphold.\rGod of our Fathers, what is man!\rThat thou towards him with hand so various,\rOr might I say contrarious,\rTemperst thy providence through his short course,\rNot evenly, as thou rul'st\rThe Angelic orders and inferiour creatures mute,\rIrrational and brute.\rNor do I name of me the common rout,\rThat wandring loose about\rGrow up and perish, as the summer flie,\rHeads without name no more rememberd,\rBut such as thou hast solemnly elected,\rWith gifts and graces eminently adorn'd\rTo some great work, thy glory,\rAnd peoples safety, which in part they effect:\rYet toward these thus dignifi'd, thou oft\rAmidst thir highth of noon,\rChangest thy countenance, and thy hand with no re- gard\rOf highest favours past\rFrom thee on them, or them to thee of service.\rNor only dost degrade them, or remit\rTo life obscur'd, which were a fair dismission,\rBut throw'st them lower then thou didst exalt them high,\rUnseemly falls in human eie,\rToo grievous for the trespass or omission,\rOft leav'st them to the hostile sword\rOf Heathen and prophane, thir carkasses\rTo dogs and fowls a prey, or else captiv'd:\rOr to the unjust tribunals, under change of times,\rAnd condemnation of the ingrateful multitude.\rIf these they scape, perhaps in poverty\rWith sickness and disease thou bow'st them down,\rPainful diseases and deform'd,\rIn crude old age;\rThough not disordinate, yet causless suffring\rThe punishment of dissolute days, in fine,\rJust or unjust, alike seem miserable,\rFor oft alike, both come to evil end.\rSo deal not with this once thy glorious Champion,\rThe Image of thy strength, and mighty minister.\rWhat do I beg?

But conjugal affection\rPrevailing over fear, and timerous doubt\rHath led me on desirous to behold\rOnce more thy face, and know of thy estate.\rIf aught in my ability may serve\rTo light'n what thou suffer'st, and appease\rThy mind with what amends is in my power,\rThough late, yet in some part to recompense\rMy rash but more unfortunate misdeed.\rOut, out\rHy\xc2\xbena;\rthese are thy wonted arts,\rAnd arts of every woman false like thee,\rTo break all faith, all vows, deceive, betray,\rThen as repentant to submit, beseech,\rAnd reconcilement move with feign'd remorse,\rConfess, and promise wonders in her change,\rNot truly penitent, but chief to try\rHer husband, how far urg'd his patience bears,\rHis vertue or weakness which way to assail:\rThen with more cautious and instructed skill\rAgain transgresses, and again submits;\rThat wisest and best men full oft beguil'd\rWith goodness principl'd not to reject\rThe penitent, but ever to forgive,\rAre drawn to wear out miserable days,\rEntangl'd with a poysnous bosom snake,\rIf not by quick destruction soon cut off\rAs I by thee, to Ages and example.\rYet hear me\rSamson;\rnot that I endeavour\rTo lessen or extenuate my offence,\rBut that on th'other side if it be weigh'd\rBy it self, with aggravations not surcharg'd,\rOr else with just allowance counterpois'd,\rI may, if possible, thy pardon find\rThe easier toward me, or thy hatred less.\rFirst granting, as I do, it was a weakness\rIn me, but incident to all our sex,\rCuriosity, inquisitive, importune\rOf secrets, then with like infirmity\rTo publish them, both common female faults:\rWas it not weakness also to make known\rFor importunity, that is for naught,\rWherein consisted all thy strength and safety?\rTo what I did thou shewdst me first the way.\rBut I to enemies reveal'd, and should not.\rNor shouldst thou have trusted that to womans frailty\rE're I to thee, thou to thy self wast cruel.\rLet weakness then with weakness come to parl\rSo near related, or the same of kind,\rThine forgive mine; that men may censure thine\rThe gentler, if severely thou exact not\rMore strength from me, then in thy self was found.\rAnd what if Love, which thou interpret'st hate,\rThe jealousie of Love, powerful of sway\rIn human hearts, not less in mine towards thee,\rCaus'd what I did? I saw thee mutable\rOf fancy, feard lest one day thou wouldst leave me\rAs her at\rTimna,\rsought by all means therefore\rHow to endear, and hold thee to me firmest:\rNo better way I saw then by importuning\rTo learn thy secrets, get into my power\rThy key of strength and safety: thou wilt say,\rWhy then reveal'd? I was assur'd by those\rWho tempted me, that nothing was design'd\rAgainst thee but safe custody, and hold:\rThat made for me, I knew that liberty\rWould draw thee forth to perilous enterprises\rWhile I at home sate full of cares and fears\rWailing thy absence in my widow'd bed;\rHere I should still enjoy thee day and night\rMine and Loves prisoner, not the\rPhilistines,\rWhole to my self, unhazarded abroad,\rFearless at home of partners in my love.\rThese reasons in Loves law have past for good,\rThough fond and reasonless to some perhaps;\rAnd Love hath oft, well meaning, wrought much wo,\rYet always pity or pardon hath obtain'd.\rBe not unlike all other, not austere\rAs thou art strong, inflexible as steel.\rIf thou in strength all mortals dost exceed,\rIn uncompassionate anger do not so.\rHow cunningly the sorceress displays\rHer own transgressions, to upbraid me mine\rThat malice not repentance brought thee hither,\rBy this appears: I gave, thou say'st, th'example,\rI led the way; bitter reproach, but true,\rI to my self was false e're thou to me,\rSuch pardon therefore as I give my folly,\rTake to thy wicked deed: which when thou seest\rImpartial, self-severe, inexorable,\rThou wilt renounce thy seeking, and much rather\rConfess it feign'd, weakness is thy excuse,\rAnd I believe it, weakness to resist\rPhilistian\rgold: if weakness may excuse,\rWhat Murtherer, what Traytor, Parricide,\rIncestuous, Sacrilegious, but may plead it?\rAll wickedness is weakness: that plea therefore\rWith God or Man will gain thee no remission.\rBut Love constrain'd thee; call it furious rage\rTo satisfie thy lust: Love seeks to have Love;\rMy love how couldst thou hope, who tookst the way\rTo raise in me inexpiable hate,\rKnowing, as needs I must, by thee betray'd?\rIn vain thou striv'st to cover shame with shame,\rOr by evasions thy crime uncoverst more.\rSince thou determinst weakness for no plea\rIn man or woman, though to thy own condemning,\rHear what assaults I had, what snares besides,\rWhat sieges girt me round, e're I consented;\rWhich might have aw'd the best resolv'd of men,\rThe constantest to have yielded without blame.\rIt was not gold, as to my charge thou lay'st,\rThat wrought with me: thou know'st the Magistrates\rAnd Princes of my countrey came in person,\rSollicited, commanded, threatn'd, urg'd,\rAdjur'd by all the bonds of civil Duty\rAnd of Religion, press'd how just it was,\rHow honourable, how glorious to entrap\rA common enemy, who had destroy'd\rSuch numbers of our Nation: and the Priest\rWas not behind, but ever at my ear,\rPreaching how meritorious with the gods\rIt would be to ensnare an irreligious\rDishonourer of\rDagon:\rwhat had I\rTo oppose against such powerful arguments?\rOnly my love of thee held long debate;\rAnd combated in silence all these reasons\rWith hard contest: at length that grounded maxim\rSo rife and celebrated in the mouths\rOf wisest men; that to the public good\rPrivate respects must yield; with grave authority\rTook full possession of me and prevail'd;\rVertue, as I thought, truth, duty so enjoyning.\rI thought where all thy circling wiles would end;\rIn feign'd Religion, smooth hypocrisie.\rBut had thy love, still odiously pretended,\rBin, as it ought, sincere, it would have taught thee\rFar other reasonings, brought forth other deeds.\rI before all the daughters of my Tribe\rAnd of my Nation chose thee from among\rMy enemies, lov'd thee, as too well though knewst,\rToo well, unbosom'd all my secrets to thee,\rNot out of levity, but over-powr'd\rBy thy request, who could deny thee nothing;\rYet now am judg'd an enemy. Why then\rDidst thou at first receive me for thy husband?\rThen, as since then, thy countries foe profest;\rBeing once a wife, for me thou wast to leave\rParents and countrey; nor was I their subject,\rNor under their protection but my own,\rThou mine, not theirs: if aught against my life\rThy countrey sought of thee, it sought unjustly,\rAgainst the law of nature, law of nations,\rNo more thy countrey, but an impious crew\rOf men conspiring to uphold thir state\rBy worse then hostile deeds, violating the ends\rFor which our countrey is a name so dear;\rNot therefore to be obey'd. But zeal mov'd thee;\rTo please thy gods thou didst it; gods unable\rTo acquit themselves and prosecute their foes\rBut by ungodly deeds, the contradiction\rOf their own deity, Gods cannot be:\rLess therefore to be pleas'd, obey'd, or fear'd,\rThese false pretexts and varnish'd colours failing,\rBare in thy guilt how foul must thou appear?\rIn argument with men a woman ever\rGoes by the worse, whatever be her cause.\rFor want of words no doubt, or lack of breath,\rbreath,\rWitness when I was worried with thy peals.\rI was a fool, too rash, and quite mistaken\rIn what I thought would have succeeded best.\rLet me obtain forgiveness of thee,\rSamson,\rAfford me place to shew what recompence\rToward thee I intend for what I have misdone,\rMisguided; only what remains past cure\rBear not too sensibly, nor still insist\rTo afflict thy self in vain: though sight be lost,\rLife yet hath many solaces, enjoy'd\rWhere other senses want not their delights\rAt home in leisure and domestic ease,\rExempt from many a care and chance to which\rEye-sight exposes daily men abroad.\rI to the Lords will intercede, not doubting\rThir favourable ear, that I may fetch thee\rFrom forth this loathsom prison-house, to abide\rWith me, where my redoubl'd love and care\rWith nursing diligence, to me glad office,\rMay ever tend about thee to old age\rWith all things grateful chear'd, and so suppli'd,\rThat what by me thou hast lost thou least shal miss.\rNo, no, of my condition take no care;\rIt fits not; thou and I long since are twain;\rNor think me so unwary or accurst\rTo bring my feet again into the snare\rWhere once I have been caught; I know thy trains\rThough dearly to my cost, thy ginns, and toyls;\rThy fair enchanted cup, and warbling charms\rNo more on me have power, their force is lull'd,\rSo much of Adders wisdom I have learn't\rTo fence my ear against thy sorceries.\rIf in my flower of youth and strength, when all men\rLov'd, honour'd, fear'd me, thou alone could hate me\rThy Husband, slght me, sell me, and forgo me;\rHow wouldst thou use me now, blind, and thereby\rDeceiveable, in most things as a child\rHelpless, thence easily contemn'd, and scorn'd,\rAnd last neglected? How wouldst thou insult\rWhen I must live uxorious to thy will\rIn perfet thraldom, how again betray me,\rBearing my words and doings to the Lords\rTo gloss upon, and censuring, frown or smile?\rThis Gaol I count the house of Liberty\rTo thine whose doors my feet shall never enter.\rLet me approach at least, and touch thy hand.\rNot for thy life, lest fierce remembrance wake\rMy sudden rage to tear thee joint by joint.\rAt distance I forgive thee, go with that;\rBewail thy falsehood, the pious works\rIt hath brought forth to make thee memorable\rAmong illustrious women, faithful wives:\rCherish thy hast'n'd widowhood with the gold\rOf Matrimonial treason: so farewel.\rI see thou art implacable, more deaf\rTo prayers, then winds and seas, yet winds to seas\rAre reconcil'd at length, and Sea to Shore:\rThy anger, unappeasable, still rages,\rEternal tempest never to be calm'd.\rWhy do I humble thus my self, and suing\rFor peace, reap nothing but repulse and hate?\rBid go with evil omen and the brand\rOf infamy upon my name denounc't?\rTo mix with thy concernments I desist\rHenceforth, nor too much disapprove my own.\rFame if not double-fac't is double-mouth'd,\rAnd with contrary blast proclaims most deeds,\rOn both his wings, one black, th'other white,\rBears greatest names in his wild \xc2\xberie flight.\rMy name perhaps among the Circumcis'd\rIn\rDan,\rin\rJudah,\rand the bordering Tribes,\rTo all posterity may stand defam'd,\rWith malediction mention'd, and the blot\rOf falshood most unconjugal traduc't.\rBut in my countrey where I most desire,\rIn\rAcron, Gaza, Asdod,\rand in\rGath\rI shall be nam'd among the famousest\rOf women, sung at solemn festivals,\rLiving and dead recorded, who to save\rHer countrey from a fierce destroyer, chose\rAbove the faith of wedlock-bonds, my tomb\rWith odours visited and annual flowers.\rNo less renown'd then in Mount\rEphraim,\rJ\xc2\xbel,\rwho with inhospitable guile\rSmote\rSisera\rsleeping through the Temples nail'd.\rNor shall I count it hainous to enjoy\rThe public marks of honour and reward\rConferr'd upon me, for the piety\rWhich to my countrey I was judg'd to have shewn.\rAt this who ever envies or repines\rI leave him to his lot, and like my own.\rShe's gone, a manifest Serpent by her sting\rDiscover'd in the end, till now conceal'd.\rSo let her go, God sent her to debase me,\rAnd aggravate my folly who committed\rTo such a viper his most sacred trust\rOf secresie, my safety, and my life.\rYet beauty, though injurious, hath strange power,\rAfter offence returning, to regain\rLove once possest, nor can be easily\rRepuls't, without much inward passion felt\rAnd secret sting of amorous remorse.\rLove-quarrels oft in pleasing concord end,\rNot wedlock-trechery endangering life.\rIt is not vertue, wisdom, valour, wit,\rStrength, comliness of shape, or amplest merit\rThat womans love can win or long inherit;\rBut what it is, hard is to say,\rHarder to hit,\r(Which way soever men refer it)\rMuch like thy riddle,\rSamson,\rin one day\rOr seven, though one should musing sit;\rIf any of these or all, the\rTimnian\rbride\rHad not so soon preferr'd\rThy Paranymph, worthless to thee compar'd,\rSuccessour in thy bed,\rNor both so loosly disally'd\rThir nuptials, nor this last so trecherously\rHad shorn the fatal harvest of thy head.\rIs it for that such outward ornament\rWas lavish't on thir Sex, that inward gifts\rWere left for hast unfinish't, judgment scant,\rCapacity not rais'd to apprehend\rOr value what is best\rIn choice, but oftest to affect the wrong?\rOr was too much of self-love mixt,\rOf constancy no root infixt,\rThat either, they love nothing, or not long?\rWhat e're it be, to wisest men and best\rSeeming at first all heavenly under virgin veil,\rSoft, modest, meek, demure,\rOnce join'd the contrary she proves, a thorn\rIntestin, far within defensive arms\rA cleaving mischief, in his way to vertue\rAdverse and turbulent, or by her charms\rDraws him awry enslav'd\rWith dotage, and his sense deprav'd\rTo folly and shameful deeds which ruin ends.\rWhat Pilot so expert but needs must wreck\rEmbarqu'd with such a Stears-mate at the Helm?\rFavour'd of Heav'n who finds\rOne vertuous rarely found,\rThat in domestic good combines:\rHappy that house! his way to peace is smooth:\rBut vertue which breaks through all oppositions,\rAnd all temptation can remove,\rMost shines and most is acceptable above.\rTherefore Gods universal Law\rGave to the man despotic power\rOver his female in due awe,\rNor from that right to part an hour,\rSmile she or lowre:\rSo shall he least confusion draw\rOn his whole life, not sway'd\rBy female usurpation, nor dismay'd.\rFair days have oft contracted wind and rain.\rBut this another kind of tempest brings.\rBe less abstruse, my riddling days are past.\rLook now for no inchanting voice, nor fear\rThe bait of honied words; a rougher tongue\rDraws hitherward, I know him by his stride,\rThe Giant\rHarapha\rof\rGath,\rhis look\rHaughty as is his pile high-built and proud.\rComes he in peace? what wind hath blown him hither\rI less conjecture then when first I saw\rThe sumptuous\rDalila\rfloating this way:\rHis habit carries peace, his brow defiance.\rOr peace or not, alike to me he comes.\rHis fraught we soon shall know, he now ar- rives.\rI come not\rSamson,\rto condole thy chance,\rAs these perhaps, yet wish it had not been,\rThough for no friendly intent.

O that fortune\rHad brought me to the field where thou art fam'd\rTo have wrought such wonders with an Asses Jaw;\rI should have forc'd thee soon with other arms,\rOr left thy carkass where the Ass lay thrown:\rSo had the glory of Prowess been recover'd\rTo\rPalestine,\rwon by a\rPhilistine\rFrom the unforeskinn'd race, of whom thou bear'st\rThe highest name for valiant Acts, that honour\rCertain to have won by mortal duel from thee,\rI lose, prevented by thy eyes put out.\rBoast not of what thou wouldst have done, but do\rWhat then thou would'st, thou seest it in thy hand.\rTo combat with a blind man I disdain,\rAnd thou hast need much washing to be toucht.\rSuch usage as your honourable Lords\rAfford me assassinated and betray'd,\rWho durst not with thir whole united powers\rIn fight withstand me single and unarm'd,\rNor in the house with chamber ambushes\rClose-banded durst attaque me, no not sleeping,\rTill they had hir'd a woman with their gold\rBreaking her Marriage Faith to circumvent me.\rTherefore without feign'd shifts let be assign'd\rSome narrow place enclos'd, where sight may give thee,\rOr rather flight, no great advantage on me;\rThen put on all thy gorgeous arms, thy Helmet\rAnd Brigandine of brass, thy broad Habergeon,\rVant-brass and Greves, and Gauntlet, add thy Spear\rA Weavers beam, and seven-times-folded shield,\rI only with an Oak'n staff will meet thee,\rAnd raise such out-cries on thy clatter'd Iron,\rWhich long shall not with-hold mee from thy head,\rThat in a little time while breath remains thee,\rThou oft shalt with thy self at\rGath\rto boast\rAgain in safety what though wouldst have done\rTo\rSamson,\rbut shalt never see\rGath\rmore.\rThou durst not thus disparage glorious arms\rWhich greatest Heroes have in battel worn,\rThir ornament and safety, had not spells\rAnd black enchantments, some Magicians Art\rArm'd thee or charm'd thee strong, which thou from Heaven\rFeigndst at thy birth was giv'n thee in thy hair,\rWhere strength can least abide, though all thy hairs\rWere bristles rang'd like those that ridge the back\rOf chaf't wild Boars, or ruffl'd Porcupines.\rI know no Spells, use no forbidden Arts;\rMy trust is in the living God who gave me\rAt my Nativity this strength, diffus'd\rNo less through all my sinews, joints and bones,\rThen thine, while I preserv'd these locks unshorn,\rThe pledge of my unviolated vow.\rFor proof hereof, if\rDagon\rbe thy god,\rGo to his Temple, invocate his aid\rWith solemnest devotion, spread before him\rHow highly it concerns his glory now\rTo frustrate and dissolve these Magic spells,\rWhich I to be the power of\rIsr\xc2\xbel\r's God\rAvow, and challenge\rDagon\rto the test,\rOffering to combat thee his Champion bold,\rWith th'utmost of his Godhead seconded:\rThen thou shalt see, or rather to thy sorrow\rSoon feel, whose God is strongest, thine or mine.\rPresume not on thy God, what e're he be,\rThee he regards not, owns not, hath cut off\rQuite from his people, and delivered up\rInto thy Enemies hand, permitted them\rTo put out both thine eyes, and fetter'd send thee\rInto the common Prison, there to grind\rAmong the Slaves and Asses thy comrades,\rAs good for nothing else, no better service\rWith those thy boyst'rous locks, no worthy match\rFor valour to assail, nor by the sword\rOf noble Warriour, so to stain his honour,\rBut by the Barbers razor best subdu'd.\rAll these indignities, for such they are\rFrom thine, these evils I deserve and more,\rAcknowledge them from God inflicted on me\rJustly, yet despair not of his final pardon\rWhose ear is ever open;

Lords are Lordliest in thir wine;\rAnd the well-feasted Priest then soonest fir'd\rWith zeal, if aught Religion seem concern'd:\rNo less the people on thir Holy-days\rImpetuous, insolent, unquenchable;\rHapp'n what may, of me expect to hear\rNothing dishonorable, impure, unworthy\rOur God, our Law, my Nation, or my self,\rThe last of me or no I cannot warrant.\rGo, and the Holy One\rOf\rIsrael\rbe thy guide\rTo what may serve his glory best, & spread his name\rGreat among the Heathen round:\rand thee the Angel of thy Birth, to stand\rFast by thy side, who from thy Fathers field\rRode up in flames after his message told\rOf fire; that Spirit that first rusht on thee\rIn the Camp of\rDan\rBe efficacious in thee now at need.\rFor never was from Heaven imparted\rMeasure of strength so great to mortal seed,\rAs in thy wond'rous actions hath been seen.\rBut wherefore comes old\rManoa\rin such hast\rWith youthful steps? much livelier then e're while\rHe seems: supposing here to find his Son,\rOr of him bringing to us some glad news?\rPeace with you brethren; my inducement hither\rWas not at present here to find my Son,\rBy order of the Lords new parted hence\rTo come and play before them at thir Feast.\rI heard all as I came, the City rings\rAnd numbers thither flock, I had no will,\rLest I should see him forc't to things unseemly.\rBut that which mov'd my coming now, was chiefly\rTo give ye part with me what hope I have\rWith good success to work his liberty.\rThat hope would much rejoyce us to partake\rWith thee; say reverend Sire, we thirst to hear.\rI have attempted one by one the Lords\rEither at home, or through the high stree passing,\rWith supplication prone and Fathers tears\rTo accept of ransom for my Son thir pris'ner,\rSome much averse I found and wondrous harsh,\rContemptuous, proud, set on revenge and spite;\rThat part most reverenc'd\rDagon\rand his Priests,\rOthers more moderate seeming, but thir aim\rPrivate reward, for which both God and State\rThey easily would set to sale, a third\rMore generous far and civil, who confess'd\rThey had anough reveng'd, having reduc't\rThir foe to misery beneath thir fears,\rThe rest was magnanimity to remit,\rIf some convenient ransom were propos'd.\rWhat noise or shout was that? it tore the Skie.\rDoubtless the people shouting to behold\rThir once great dread, captive, & blind before them,\rOr at some proof of strength before them shown.\rHis ransom, if my whole inheritance\rMay compass it, shall willingly be paid\rAnd numberd down: much rather I shall chuse\rTo live the poorest in my Tribe, then richest,\rAnd he in that calamitous prison left.\rNo, I am fixt not to part hence without him.\rFor his redemption all my Patrimony,\rIf need be, I am ready to forgo\rAnd quit: not wanting him, I shall want nothing.\rFathers are wont to lay up for thir Sons,\rThou for thy Son art bent to lay out all;\rSons wont to nurse thir Parents in old age,\rThou in old age car'st how to nurse thy Son.\rMade older then thy age through eye-sight lost.\rIt shall be my delight to tend his eyes,\rAnd view him sitting in the house, enobl'd\rWith all those high exploits by him atchiev'd,\rAnd on his shoulders waving down those locks,\rThat of a Nation arm'd the strength contain'd:\rAnd I perswade me God had not permitted\rHis strength again to grow up with his hair\rGarrison'd round about him like a Camp\rOf faithful Souldiery, were not his purpose\rTo use him further yet in some great service,\rNot to sit idle with so great a gift\rUseless, and thence ridiculous about him.\rAnd since his strength with eye-sight was not lost,\rGod will restore him eye-sight to his strength.\rThy hopes are not ill founded nor seem vain\rOf his delivery, and thy joy thereon\rConceiv'd, agreeable to a Fathers love,\rIn both which we, as next participate.\rI know your friendly minds and--O what noise\rMercy of Heav'n what hideous noise was that!\rHorribly loud unlike the former shout.\rNoise call you it or universal groan\rAs if the whole inhabitation perish'd,\rBlood, death, and deathful deeds are in that noise,\rRuin, destruction at the utmost point.\rOf ruin indeed methought I heard the noise,\rOh it continues, they have slain my Son.\rThy Son is rather slaying them, that outcry\rFrom slaughter of one foe could not ascend.\rMan.\rSome dismal accident it needs must be;\rWhat shall we do, stay here or run and see?\rBest keep together here, lest running thither\rWe unawares run into dangers mouth.\rThis evil on the\rPhililstines\ris fall'n,\rFrom whom could else a general cry be heard?\rThe sufferers then will scarce molest us here,\rFrom other hands we need not much to fear.\rWhat if his eye-sight (for to\rIsrael\rs God\rNothing is hard) by miracle restor'd,\rHe now be dealing dole among his foes,\rAnd over heaps of slaughter'd walk his way?\rThat were a joy presumptuous to be thought.\rYet god hath wrought things as incredible\rFor his people of old; what hinders now?\rHe can I know, but doubt to think he will;\rYet Hope would fain subscribe, and tempts Belief.\rA little stay will bring some notice hither.\rOf good or bad so great, of bad the sooner;\rFor evil news rides post, while good news baits.\rAnd to our wish I see one hither speeding,\rAnd\rEbrew,\ras I guess, and of our Tribe.\rO whither shall I run, or which way flie\rThe sight of this so horrid spectacle\rWhich earst my eyes beheld and yet behold;\rFor dire imagination still persues me.\rBut providence or instinct of nature seems,\rOr reason though disturb'd, and scarce consulted\rTo have guided me aright, I know not how,\rTo thee first revered\rManoa,\rand to these\rMy Countreymen, whom here I knew remaining,\rAs at some distance from the place of horrour,\rSo in the sad event too much concern'd.\rThe accident was loud, &\rhere\rbefore thee\rWith rueful cry, yet what it was we hear not,\rNo Preface needs, thou seest we long to know.\rIt would burst forth, but I recover breath\rAnd sense distract, to know well what I utter.\rTell us the sum, the cirumstance defer.\rGaza\ryet stands, but all her Sons are fall'n,\rAll in a moment overwhelm'd and fall'n.\rSad, but thou knowst to\rIsraelites\rnot saddest\rThe desolation of a Hostile City.\rMess.\rFeed on that first, there may in grief be sur fet.\rRelate by whom.\rBy\rSamson.\rThat still lessens\rThe sorrow, and converts it nigh to joy.\rAh\rManoah\rI refrain, too suddenly\rTo utter what will come at last too soon;\rLest evil tidings with too rude irruption\rHitting thy aged ear should pierce too deep.\rSuspense in news is torture, speak them out.\rThen take the worst in brief,\rSamson\ris dead.\rThe worst indeed, O all my hope's defeated\rTo free him hence! but death who sets all free\rHath paid his ransom now and full discharge.\rWhat windy joy this day had I conceiv'd\rHopeful of his Delivery, which now proves\rAbortive as the first-born bloom of spring\rNipt with the lagging rear of winters frost.\rYet e're I give the rains to grief, say first,\rHow dy'd he? death to life is crown or shame.\rAll by him fell thou say'st, by whom fell he,\rWhat glorious hand gave\rSamson\rhis deaths wound?\rUnwounded of his enemies he fell.\rWearied with slaughter then or how? explain.\rBy his own hands.\rSelf-violence? what cause\rBrought him so soon at variance with himself\rAmong his foes?\rInevitable cause\rAt once both to destroy and be destroy'd;\rThe Edifice where all were met to see him\rUpon thir heads and on his own he pull'd.\rO lastly over-strong against thy self!\rA dreadful way thou took'st to thy revenge.\rMore then anough we know; but while things yet\rAre in confusion, give us if thou canst,\rEye-witness of what first or last was done,\rRelation more particular and distinct.\rOccasions drew me early to this City,\rAnd as the gates I enter'd with Sun-rise,\rThe morning Trumpets Festival proclaim'd\rThrough each high street: little I had dispatch't\rWhen all abroad was rumour'd that this day\rSamson\rshould be brought forth to shew the people\rProof of his mighty strength in feats and games:\rI sorrow'd at his captive state, but minded\rNot to be absent at that spectacle.\rThe building was a spacious Theatre\rHalf round on two main Pillars vaulted high,\rWith seats where all the Lords and each degree\rOf sort, might sit in order to behold,\rThe other side was op'n, where the throng\rOn banks and scaffolds under Skie might stand;\rI among these aloof obscurely stood.\rThe Feast and noon grew high, and Sacrifice\rHad fill'd thir hearts with mirth, high chear, & wine,\rWhen to thir sports they turn'd. Immediately\rWas\rSamson\ras a public servant brought,\rIn thir state Livery clad; before him Pipes\rAnd Timbrels, on each side went armed guards\rBoth horse and foot before him and behind\rArchers, and Slingers, Cataphracts and Spears.\rAt sight of him the people with a shout\rRifted the Air clamouring thir god with praise,\rWho had made thir dreadful enemy thir thrall.\rHe patient but undaunted where they led him,\rCame to the place, and what was set before him\rWhich without help of eye, might be assay'd,\rTo heave, pull, draw, or break, he still perform'd\rAll with incredible, stupendious force,\rNone daring to appear Antagonist.\rAt length for intermission sake they led him\rBetween the pillars; he his guide requested\r(For so from such as nearer stood we heard)\rAs over-tir'd to let him lean a while\rWith both his arms on those massie Pillars\rThat to the arched roof gave main support.\rHe unsuspitious led him; which when\rSamson\rFelt in his arms, with head a while enclin'd,\rAnd eyes fast fixt he stood, as one who pray'd,\rOr some great matter in his mind revolv'd.\rAt last with head erect thus cryed aloud,\rHitherto, Lords, what your commands impos'd\rI have perform'd, as reason was obeying,\rNot without wonder or delight beheld.\rNow of my own accord such other tryal\rI mean to shew you of my strength, yet greater;\rAs with amaze shall strike all who behold.\rThis utter'd, straining all his nerves he bow'd,\rAs with the force of winds and waters pent,\rWhen Mountains tremble, those two massie Pillars\rWith horrible convuslion to and fro,\rHe tugg'd, he shook, till down they came and drew\rThe whole roof after them, with burst of thunder\rUpon the heads of all who sate beneath,\rLords, Ladies, Captains, Councellors, or Priests,\rThir choice nobility and flower, not only\rOf this but each\rPhilistian\rCity round\rMet from all parts to solemnize this Feast.\rSamson\rwith these immixt, inevitably\rPulld down the same destruction on himself;\rThe vulgar only scap'd who stood without.\rO dearly-bought revenge, yet glorious!\rLiving or dying thou hast fulfill'd\rThe work for which thou was foretold\rTo\rIsrael,\rand now ly'st victorious\rAmong thy slain self-kill'd\rNot willingly, but tangl'd in the fold,\rOf dire necessity, whose law in death conjoin'd\rThee with thy slaughter'd foes in number more\rThen all thy life had slain before.\rWhile thir hearts were jocund and sublime,\rDrunk with Idolatry, drunk with Wine,\rAnd fat regorg'd of Bulls and Goats,\rChaunting thir Idol, and preferring\rBefore our living Dread who dwells\rIn\rSilo\rhis bright Sanctuary:\rAmong them he a spirit of phrenzie sent,\rWho hurt thir minds,\rAnd urg'd them on with mad desire\rTo call in hast for thir destroyer;\rThey only set on sport and play\rUnweetingly importun'd\rThir own destruction to come speedy upon them.\rSo fond are mortal men\rFall'n into wrath divine,\rAs thir own ruin on themselves to invite,\rInsensate left, or to sense reprobate,\rAnd with blindness internal struck.\rBut he though blind of sight,\rDespis'd and though extinguish't quite,\rWith inward eyes illuminated\rHis fierie vertue rouz'd\rFrom under ashes into sudden flame,\rAnd as an ev'ning Dragon came,\rAssailant on the perched roosts,\rAnd nests in order rang'd\rOf tame villatic Fowl; but as an Eagle\rHis cloudless thunder bolted on thir heads.\rSo vertue giv'n for lost,\rDeprest, and overthrown, as seem'd,\rLike that self-begott'n bird\rIn the\rArabian\rwoods embost,\rThat no second knows nor third,\rAnd lay e're while a Holocaust,\rFrom out her ashie womb now teem'd,\rRevives, reflourishes, then vigorous most\rWhen most unactive deem'd,\rAnd though her body die, her fame survives,\rA secular bird ages of lives.\rCome, come, no time for lamentation now,\rNor much more cause,\rSamson\rhath quit himself\rLike\rSamson,\rand heroicly hath finish'd\rA life Heroic, on his Enemies\rFully reveng'd, hath left them years of mourning,\rAnd lamentation to the Sons of\rCaphtor\rThrough all\rPhilistian\rbounds. To\rIsrael\rHonour hath left, and freedom, let but them\rFind courage to lay hold on this occasion,\rTo himself and Fathers house eternal fame;\rAnd which is best and happiest yet, all this\rWith God not parted from him, as was feard,\rBut favouring and assisting to the end.\rNothing is here for tears, nothing to wail\rOr knock the breast, no weakness, no contempt,\rDispraise, or blame, nothing but well and fair,\rAnd what may quiet us in a death so noble.\rLet us go find the body where it lies\rSok't in his enemies blood, and from the stream\rWith lavers pure and cleansing herbs wash off\rThe clotted gore. I with what speed the while\r(\rGaza\ris not in plight to say us nay)\rWill send for all my kindred, all my friends\rTo fetch him hence and solemnly attend\rWith silent obsequie and funeral train\rHome to his Fathers house: there will I build him\rA Monument, and plant it round with shade\rOf Laurel ever green, and branching Palm,\rWith all his Trophies hung, and Acts enroll'ed\rIn copious Legend, or sweet\rThither shall all the valiant youth resort,\rAnd from his memory inflame thir breasts\rTo matchless valour, and adventures high:\rThe Virgins also shall on feastful days\rVisit his Tomb with flowers, only bewailing\rHis lot unfortunate in nuptial choice,\rFrom whence captivity and loss of eyes.\rAll is best, though we oft doubt,\rWhat th'unsearchable dispose\rOf highest wisdom brings about,\rAnd ever best found in the close.\rOft he seems to hide his face,\rBut unexpectedly returns\rAnd to his faithful Champion hath in place\rBore witness gloriously; whence\rGaza\rmourns\rAnd all that band them resist\rHis uncontroulable intent,\rHis servants he with new acquist\rOf true experience from this great event\rWith peace and consolation hath dismist,\rAnd calm of mind all passion spent.\rTHE END\rOmissa\rPage 89 after verse 537 which ends,\rNot much to fear,\rinsert these.\rWhat if his eye-sight (for to\rIsrael\rs God\rNothing is hard) by miracle restor'd,\rHe now be dealing dole among his foes,\rAnd over heaps of slaughter'd walk his way?\rThat were a joy presumptuous to be thought.\rYet god hath wrought things as incredible\rFor his people of old; what hinders now?\rHe can I know, but doubt to think he will;\rYet Hope would fain subscribe, and tempts Belief.\rAfter the next verse which begins,\rA little stay,\rinsert this.\rOf good or bad so great, of bad the sooner;\rThen follows in order,\rFor evil news,\r&c.\r\r\n"
