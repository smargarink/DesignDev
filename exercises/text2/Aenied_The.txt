Collections\r\r\r\n\r\rBOOK I\r\r\rBKI:1-11 INVOCATION TO THE MUSE\r\rI sing of arms and the man, he who, exiled by fate,\rfirst came from the coast of Troy to Italy, and to\rLavinian shores \xc3\x90 hurled about endlessly by land and sea,\rby the will of the gods, by cruel Juno\xc3\x95s remorseless anger,\rlong suffering also in war, until he founded a city\rand brought his gods to Latium: from that the Latin people\rcame, the lords of Alba Longa, the walls of noble Rome.\rMuse, tell me the cause: how was she offended in her divinity,\rhow was she grieved, the Queen of Heaven, to drive a man,\rnoted for virtue, to endure such dangers, to face so many\rtrials? Can there be such anger in the minds of the gods?\r\rBKI:12-49 THE ANGER OF JUNO\r\rThere was an ancient city, Carthage (held by colonists from Tyre),\ropposite Italy, and the far-off mouths of the Tiber,\rrich in wealth, and very savage in pursuit of war.\rThey say Juno loved this one land above all others,\reven neglecting Samos: here were her weapons\rand her chariot, even then the goddess worked at,\rand cherished, the idea that it should have supremacy\rover the nations, if only the fates allowed.\rYet she\xc3\x95d heard of offspring, derived from Trojan blood,\rthat would one day overthrow the Tyrian stronghold:\rthat from them a people would come, wide-ruling, \rand proud in war, to Libya\xc3\x95s ruin: so the Fates ordained.\rFearing this, and remembering the ancient war\rshe had fought before, at Troy, for her dear Argos,\r(and the cause of her anger and bitter sorrows\rhad not yet passed from her mind: the distant judgement\rof Paris stayed deep in her heart, the injury to her scorned beauty,\rher hatred of the race, and abducted Ganymede\xc3\x95s honours)\rthe daughter of Saturn, incited further by this,\rhurled the Trojans, the Greeks and pitiless Achilles had left, \rround the whole ocean, keeping them far from Latium:\rthey wandered for many years, driven by fate over all the seas.\rSuch an effort it was to found the Roman people.\rThey were hardly out of sight of Sicily\xc3\x95s isle, in deeper water,\rjoyfully spreading sail, bronze keel ploughing the brine, \rwhen Juno, nursing the eternal wound in her breast,\rspoke to herself: \xc3\x94Am I to abandon my purpose, conquered,\runable to turn the Teucrian king away from Italy!\rWhy, the fates forbid it. Wasn\xc3\x95t Pallas able to burn\rthe Argive fleet, to sink it in the sea, because of the guilt\rand madness of one single man, Ajax, son of Oileus? \rShe herself hurled Jupiter\xc3\x95s swift fire from the clouds,\rscattered the ships, and made the sea boil with storms:\rShe caught him up in a water-spout, as he breathed flame\rfrom his pierced chest, and pinned him to a sharp rock:\ryet I, who walk about as queen of the gods, wife\rand sister of Jove, wage war on a whole race, for so many years.\rIndeed, will anyone worship Juno\xc3\x95s power from now on,\ror place offerings, humbly, on her altars?\xc3\x95\r\rBKI:50-80 JUNO ASKS AEOLUS FOR HELP\r\rSo debating with herself, her heart inflamed, the goddess\rcame to Aeolia, to the country of storms, the place\rof wild gales. Here in his vast cave, King Aeolus,\rkeeps the writhing winds, and the roaring tempests,\runder control, curbs them with chains and imprisonment.\rThey moan angrily at the doors, with a mountain\xc3\x95s vast murmurs:\rAeolus sits, holding his sceptre, in his high stronghold,\rsoftening their passions, tempering their rage: if not,\rthey\xc3\x95d surely carry off seas and lands and the highest heavens, \rwith them, in rapid flight, and sweep them through the air.\rBut the all-powerful Father, fearing this, hid them\rin dark caves, and piled a high mountain mass over them\rand gave them a king, who by fixed agreement, would know\rhow to give the order to tighten or slacken the reins. \rJuno now offered these words to him, humbly:\r\xc3\x94Aeolus, since the Father of gods, and king of men,\rgave you the power to quell, and raise, the waves with the winds,\rthere is a people I hate sailing the Tyrrhenian Sea,\rbringing Troy\xc3\x95s conquered gods to Italy:\rAdd power to the winds, and sink their wrecked boats,\ror drive them apart, and scatter their bodies over the sea.\rI have fourteen Nymphs of outstanding beauty:\rof whom I\xc3\x95ll name Deiopea, the loveliest in looks,\rjoined in eternal marriage, and yours for ever, so that, \rfor such service to me as yours, she\xc3\x95ll spend all her years\rwith you, and make you the father of lovely children.\xc3\x95\rAeolus replied: \xc3\x94Your task, O queen, is to decide\rwhat you wish: my duty is to fulfil your orders. \rYou brought about all this kingdom of mine, the sceptre,\rJove\xc3\x95s favour, you gave me a seat at the feasts of the gods,\rand you made me lord of the storms and the tempests.\xc3\x95\r\rBKI:81-123 AEOLUS RAISES THE STORM\r\rWhen he had spoken, he reversed his trident and struck\rthe hollow mountain on the side: and the winds, formed ranks,\rrushed out by the door he\xc3\x95d made, and whirled across the earth.\rThey settle on the sea, East and West wind, \rand the wind from Africa, together, thick with storms, \rstir it all from its furthest deeps, and roll vast waves to shore:\rfollows a cry of men and a creaking of cables.\rSuddenly clouds take sky and day away\rfrom the Trojan\xc3\x95s eyes: dark night rests on the sea.\rIt thunders from the pole, and the aether flashes thick fire,\rand all things threaten immediate death to men.\rInstantly Aeneas groans, his limbs slack with cold:\rstretching his two hands towards the heavens,\rhe cries out in this voice: \xc3\x94Oh, three, four times fortunate\rwere those who chanced to die in front of their father\xc3\x95s eyes\runder Troy\xc3\x95s high walls! O Diomede, son of Tydeus\rbravest of Greeks! Why could I not have fallen, at your hand, \rin the fields of Ilium, and poured out my spirit, \rwhere fierce Hector lies, beneath Achilles\xc3\x95s spear,\rand mighty Sarpedon: where Simois rolls, and sweeps away\rso many shields, helmets, brave bodies, of men, in its waves!\xc3\x95\rHurling these words out, a howling blast from the north,\rstrikes square on the sail, and lifts the seas to heaven:\rthe oars break: then the prow swings round and offers\rthe beam to the waves: a steep mountain of water follows in a mass.\rSome ships hang on the breaker\xc3\x95s crest: to others the yawning deep\rshows land between the waves: the surge rages with sand.\rThe south wind catches three, and whirls them onto hidden rocks\r(rocks the Italians call the Altars, in mid-ocean,\ra vast reef on the surface of the sea) three the east wind drives\rfrom the deep, to the shallows and quick-sands (a pitiful sight),\rdashes them against the bottom, covers them with a gravel mound.\rA huge wave, toppling, strikes one astern, in front of his very eyes,\rone carrying faithful Orontes and the Lycians. \rThe steersman\xc3\x95s thrown out and hurled headlong, face down:\rbut the sea turns the ship three times, driving her round,\rin place, and the swift vortex swallows her in the deep.\rSwimmers appear here and there in the vast waste,\rmen\xc3\x95s weapons, planking, Trojan treasure in the waves.\rNow the storm conquers Iloneus\xc3\x95s tough ship, now Achates,\rnow that in which Abas sailed, and old Aletes\xc3\x95s:\rtheir timbers sprung in their sides, all the ships\rlet in the hostile tide, and split open at the seams.\r\rBKI:124-156 NEPTUNE INTERVENES\r\rNeptune, meanwhile, greatly troubled, saw that the sea\rwas churned with vast murmur, and the storm was loose\rand the still waters welled from their deepest levels:\rhe raised his calm face from the waves, gazing over the deep.\rHe sees Aeneas\xc3\x95s fleet scattered all over the ocean,\rthe Trojans crushed by the breakers, and the plummeting sky.\rAnd Juno\xc3\x95s anger, and her stratagems, do not escape her brother.\rHe calls the East and West winds to him, and then says:\r\xc3\x94Does confidence in your birth fill you so? Winds, do you dare,\rwithout my intent, to mix earth with sky, and cause such trouble,\rnow? You whom I \xc3\x90 ! But it\xc3\x95s better to calm the running waves:\ryou\xc3\x95ll answer to me later for this misfortune,\rwith a different punishment.\rHurry, fly now, and say this to your king:\rcontrol of the ocean, and the fierce trident, were given to me,\rby lot, and not to him. He owns the wild rocks, home to you,\rand yours, East Wind: let Aeolus officiate in his palace,\rand be king in the closed prison of the winds.\xc3\x95\rSo he speaks, and swifter than his speech, he calms the swollen sea,\rscatters the gathered cloud, and brings back the sun.\rCymotho\xe2\x80\x98 and Triton, working together, thrust the ships\rfrom the sharp reef: Neptune himself raises them with his trident,\rparts the vast quicksand, tempers the flood,\rand glides on weightless wheels, over the tops of the waves.\rAs often, when rebellion breaks out in a great nation,\rand the common rabble rage with passion, and soon stones\rand fiery torches fly (frenzy supplying weapons),\rif they then see a man of great virtue, and weighty service,\rthey are silent, and stand there listening attentively:\rhe sways their passions with his words and soothes their hearts:\rso all the uproar of the ocean died, as soon as their father,\rgazing over the water, carried through the clear sky, wheeled\rhis horses, and gave them their head, flying behind in his chariot.\r\rBKI:157-222 SHELTER ON THE LIBYAN COAST\r\rThe weary followers of Aeneas made efforts to set a course\rfor the nearest land, and tacked towards the Libyan coast.\rThere is a place there in a deep inlet: an island forms a harbour\rwith the barrier of its bulk, on which every wave from the deep\rbreaks, and divides into diminishing ripples.\rOn this side and that, vast cliffs and twin crags loom in the sky,\runder whose summits the whole sea is calm, far and wide:\rthen, above that, is a scene of glittering woods, \rand a dark grove overhangs the water, with leafy shade:\runder the headland opposite is a cave, curtained with rock,\rinside it, fresh water, and seats of natural stone,\rthe home of Nymphs. No hawsers moor the weary ships\rhere, no anchor, with its hooked flukes, fastens them.\rAeneas takes shelter here with seven ships gathered\rfrom the fleet, and the Trojans, with a passion for dry land,\rdisembarking, take possession of the sands they longed for, \rand stretch their brine-caked bodies on the shore.\rAt once Achates strikes a spark from his flint,\rcatches the fire in the leaves, places dry fuel round it,\rand quickly has flames among the kindling.\rThen, wearied by events, they take out wheat, damaged\rby the sea, and implements of Ceres, and prepare to parch\rthe grain over the flames, and grind it on stone.\rAeneas climbs a crag meanwhile, and searches the whole prospect\rfar and wide over the sea, looking if he can see anything\rof Antheus and his storm-tossed Phrygian galleys,\ror Capys, or Caicus\xc3\x95s arms blazoned on a high stern. \rThere\xc3\x95s no ship in sight: he sees three stags wandering\ron the shore: whole herds of deer follow at their back,\rand graze in long lines along the valley.\rHe halts at this, and grasps in his hand his bow \rand swift arrows, shafts that loyal Achates carries,\rand first he shoots the leaders themselves, their heads,\rwith branching antlers, held high, then the mass, with his shafts,\rand drives the whole crowd in confusion among the leaves:\rThe conqueror does not stop until he\xc3\x95s scattered seven huge\rcarcasses on the ground, equal in number to his ships.\rThen he seeks the harbour, and divides them among all his friends.\rNext he shares out the wine that the good Acestes had stowed\rin jars, on the Trinacrian coast, and that hero had given them\ron leaving: and speaking to them, calmed their sad hearts:\r\xc3\x94O friends (well, we were not unknown to trouble before)\rO you who\xc3\x95ve endured worse, the god will grant an end to this too.\rYou\xc3\x95ve faced rabid Scylla, and her deep-sounding cliffs:\rand you\xc3\x95ve experienced the Cyclopes\xc3\x95s rocks:\rremember your courage and chase away gloomy fears:\rperhaps one day you\xc3\x95ll even delight in remembering this.\rThrough all these misfortunes, these dangerous times,\rwe head for Latium, where the fates hold peaceful lives\rfor us: there Troy\xc3\x95s kingdom can rise again. Endure,\rand preserve yourselves for happier days.\xc3\x95\rSo his voice utters, and sick with the weight of care, he pretends\rhope, in his look, and stifles the pain deep in his heart.\rThey make ready the game, and the future feast:\rthey flay the hides from the ribs and lay the flesh bare:\rsome cut it in pieces, quivering, and fix it on spits,\rothers place cauldrons on the beach, and feed them with flames.\rThen they revive their strength with food, stretched on the grass,\rand fill themselves with rich venison and old wine.\rWhen hunger is quenched by the feast, and the remnants cleared,\rdeep in conversation, they discuss their missing friends, \rand, between hope and fear, question whether they live,\ror whether they\xc3\x95ve suffered death and no longer hear their name.\rAeneas, the virtuous, above all mourns the lot of fierce Orontes,\rthen that of Amycus, together with Lycus\xc3\x95s cruel fate, \rand those of brave Gyus, and brave Cloanthus.\r\rBKI:223-256 VENUS INTERCEDES WITH JUPITER\r\rNow, all was complete, when Jupiter, from the heights of the air,\rlooked down on the sea with its flying sails, and the broad lands,\rand the coasts, and the people far and wide, and paused, \rat the summit of heaven, and fixed his eyes on the Libyan kingdom.\rAnd as he weighed such cares as he had in his heart, Venus spoke\rto him, sadder still, her bright eyes brimming with tears:\r\xc3\x94Oh you who rule things human, and divine, with eternal law,\rand who terrify them all with your lightning-bolt,\rwhat can my Aeneas have done to you that\xc3\x95s so serious,\rwhat have the Trojans done, who\xc3\x95ve suffered so much destruction,\rto whom the whole world\xc3\x95s closed, because of the Italian lands?\rSurely you promised that at some point, as the years rolled by,\rthe Romans would rise from them, leaders would rise,\rrestored from Teucer\xc3\x95s blood, who would hold power\rover the sea, and all the lands. Father, what thought has changed\ryour mind? It consoled me for the fall of Troy, and its sad ruin,\rweighing one destiny, indeed, against opposing destinies:\rnow the same misfortune follows these men driven on by such\rdisasters. Great king, what end to their efforts will you give?\rAntenor could escape through the thick of the Greek army,\rand safely enter the Illyrian gulfs, and deep into the realms\rof the Liburnians, and pass the founts of Timavus,\rfrom which the river bursts, with a huge mountainous roar,\rthrough nine mouths, and buries the fields under its noisy flood.\rHere, nonetheless, he sited the city of Padua, and homes\rfor Teucrians, and gave the people a name, and hung up\rthe arms of Troy: now he\xc3\x95s calmly settled, in tranquil peace.\rBut we, your race, to whom you permit the heights of heaven,\rlose our ships (shameful!), betrayed, because of one person\xc3\x95s anger,\rand kept far away from the shores of Italy.\rIs this the prize for virtue? Is this how you restore our rule?\rThe father of men and gods, smiled at her with that look\rwith which he clears the sky of storms,\rkissed his daughter\xc3\x95s lips, and then said this:\r\rBKI:257-296 JUPITER\xc3\x95S PROPHECY\r\r\xc3\x94Don\xc3\x95t be afraid, Cytherea, your child\xc3\x95s fate remains unaltered:\rYou\xc3\x95ll see the city of Lavinium, and the walls I promised,\rand you\xc3\x95ll raise great-hearted Aeneas high, to the starry sky:\rNo thought has changed my mind. This son of yours\r(since this trouble gnaws at my heart, I\xc3\x95ll speak,\rand unroll the secret scroll of destiny)\rwill wage a mighty war in Italy, destroy proud peoples,\rand establish laws, and city walls, for his warriors,\runtil a third summer sees his reign in Latium, and \rthree winter camps pass since the Rutulians were beaten.\rBut the boy Ascanius, surnamed Iulus now (He was Ilus\rwhile the Ilian kingdom was a reality) will imperially\rcomplete thirty great circles of the turning months,\rand transfer his throne from its site at Lavinium,\rand mighty in power, will build the walls of Alba Longa.\rHere kings of Hector\xc3\x95s race will reign now \rfor three hundred years complete, until a royal priestess,\rIlia, heavy with child, shall bear Mars twins.\rThen Romulus will further the race, proud in his nurse\rthe she-wolf\xc3\x95s tawny pelt, and found the walls of Mars,\rand call the people Romans, from his own name.\rI\xc3\x95ve fixed no limits or duration to their possessions:\rI\xc3\x95ve given them empire without end. Why, harsh Juno\rwho now torments land, and sea and sky with fear,\rwill respond to better judgement, and favour the Romans,\rmasters of the world, and people of the toga, with me.\rSo it is decreed. A time will come, as the years glide by,\rwhen the Trojan house of Assaracus will force Phthia\rinto slavery, and be lords of beaten Argos. \rFrom this glorious source a Trojan Caesar will be born,\rwho will bound the empire with Ocean, his fame with the stars,\rAugustus, a Julius, his name descended from the great Iulus.\rYou, no longer anxious, will receive him one day in heaven,\rburdened with Eastern spoils: he\xc3\x95ll be called to in prayer.\rThen with wars abandoned, the harsh ages will grow mild:\rWhite haired Trust, and Vesta, Quirinus with his brother Remus\rwill make the laws: the gates of War, grim with iron, \rand narrowed by bars, will be closed: inside impious Rage will roar\rfrighteningly from blood-stained mouth, seated on savage weapons,\rhands tied behind his back, with a hundred knots of bronze.\xc3\x95\r\rBKI:297-371 VENUS SPEAKS TO AENEAS\r\rSaying this, he sends Mercury, Maia\xc3\x95s son, down from heaven,\rso that the country and strongholds of this new Carthage \rwould open to the Trojans, as guests, and Dido, unaware of fate, \rwould not keep them from her territory. He flies through the air\rwith a beating of mighty wings and quickly lands on Libyan shore.\rAnd soon does as commanded, and the Phoenicians set aside\rtheir savage instincts, by the god\xc3\x95s will: the queen above all \radopts calm feelings, and kind thoughts, towards the Trojans.\rBut Aeneas, the virtuous, turning things over all night,\rdecides, as soon as kindly dawn appears, to go out\rand explore the place, to find what shores he has reached,\ron the wind, who owns them (since he sees desert) \rman or beast, and bring back the details to his friends. \rHe conceals the boats in over-hanging woods\runder an arching cliff, enclosed by trees\rand leafy shadows: accompanied only by Achetes,\rhe goes, swinging two broad-bladed spears in his hand.\rHis mother met him herself, among the trees, with the face\rand appearance of a virgin, and a virgin\xc3\x95s weapons,\ra Spartan girl, or such as Harpalyce of Thrace, \rwho wearies horses, and outdoes winged Hebrus in flight.\rFor she\xc3\x95d slung her bow from her shoulders, at the ready,\rlike a huntress, and loosed her hair for the wind to scatter,\rher knees bare, and her flowing tunic gathered up in a knot.\rAnd she cried first: \xc3\x94Hello, you young men, tell me, \rif you\xc3\x95ve seen my sister wandering here by any chance,\rwearing a quiver, and the hide of a dappled lynx,\ror shouting, hot on the track of a slavering boar?\xc3\x95\rSo Venus: and so Venus\xc3\x95s son began in answer:\r\xc3\x94I\xc3\x95ve not seen or heard any of your sisters, O Virgin \xc3\x90\ror how should I name you? Since your looks are not mortal\rand your voice is more than human: oh, a goddess for certain!\rOr Phoebus\xc3\x95s sister? Or one of the race of Nymphs?\rBe kind, whoever you may be, and lighten our labour,\rand tell us only what sky we\xc3\x95re under, and what shores\rwe\xc3\x95ve landed on: we\xc3\x95re adrift here, driven by wind and vast seas,\rknowing nothing of the people or the country:\rmany a sacrifice to you will fall at the altars, under our hand.\xc3\x95\rThen Venus said: \xc3\x94I don\xc3\x95t think myself worthy of such honours:\rit\xc3\x95s the custom of Tyrian girls to carry a quiver, \rand lace our calves high up, over red hunting boots. \rYou see the kingdom of Carthage, Tyrians, Agenor\xc3\x95s city:\rbut bordered by Libyans, a people formidable in war.\rDido rules this empire, having set out from Tyre,\rfleeing her brother. It\xc3\x95s a long tale of wrong, with many\rwindings: but I\xc3\x95ll trace the main chapters of the story.\rSychaeus was her husband, wealthiest, in land, of Phoenicians\rand loved with a great love by the wretched girl, \rwhose father gave her as a virgin to him, and wed them\rwith great solemnity. But her brother Pygmalion, savage\rin wickedness beyond all others, held the kingdom of Tyre. \rMadness came between them. The king, blinded by greed for gold,\rkilled the unwary Sychaeus, secretly, with a knife, impiously,\rin front of the altars, indifferent to his sister\xc3\x95s affections. \rHe concealed his actions for a while, deceived the lovesick girl,\rwith empty hopes, and many evil pretences.\rBut the ghost of her unburied husband came to her in dream:\rlifting his pale head in a strange manner, he laid bare the cruelty\rat the altars, and his heart pierced by the knife,\rand unveiled all the secret wickedness of that house.\rThen he urged her to leave quickly and abandon her country,\rand, to help her journey, revealed an ancient treasure\runder the earth, an unknown weight of gold and silver.\rShaken by all this, Dido prepared her flight and her friends.\rThose who had fierce hatred of the tyrant or bitter fear,\rgathered together: they seized some ships that by chance\rwere ready, and loaded the gold: greedy Pygmalion\xc3\x95s riches\rare carried overseas: a woman leads the enterprise.\rThe came to this place, and bought land, where you now see\rthe vast walls, and resurgent stronghold, of new Carthage,\ras much as they could enclose with the strips of hide\rfrom a single bull, and from that they called it Byrsa.\rBut who then are you? What shores do you come from?\rWhat course do you take?\xc3\x95 He sighed as she questioned him,\rand drawing the words from deep in his heart he replied:\r\rBKI:372-417 SHE DIRECTS HIM TO DIDO\xc3\x95S PALACE\r\r\xc3\x94O goddess, if I were to start my tale at the very beginning, \rand you had time to hear the story of our misfortunes,\rVesper would have shut day away in the closed heavens.\rA storm drove us at whim to Libya\xc3\x95s shores, \rsailing the many seas from ancient Troy, \rif by chance the name of Troy has come to your hearing.\rI am that Aeneas, the virtuous, who carries my household gods\rin my ship with me, having snatched them from the enemy, \rmy name is known beyond the sky.\rI seek my country Italy, and a people born of Jupiter on high.\rI embarked on the Phrygian sea with twenty ships,\rfollowing my given fate, my mother, a goddess, showing the way:\rbarely seven are left, wrenched from the wind and waves.\rI myself wander, destitute and unknown, in the Libyan desert,\rdriven from Europe and Asia.\xc3\x95 Venus did not wait\rfor further complaint but broke in on his lament like this:\r\xc3\x94Whoever you are I don\xc3\x95t think you draw the breath of life\rwhile hated by the gods, you who\xc3\x95ve reached a city of Tyre.\rOnly go on from here, and take yourself to the queen\xc3\x95s threshold,\rsince I bring you news that your friends are restored,\rand your ships recalled, driven to safety by the shifting winds,\runless my parents taught me false prophecies, in vain.\rSee, those twelve swans in exultant line, that an eagle,\rJupiter\xc3\x95s bird, swooping from the heavens,\rwas troubling in the clear sky: now, in a long file, they seem\rto have settled, or be gazing down now at those who already have.\rAs, returning, their wings beat in play, and they circle the zenith\rin a crowd, and give their cry, so your ships and your people\rare in harbour, or near its entrance under full sail.\rOnly go on, turn your steps where the path takes you.\xc3\x95\rShe spoke, and turning away she reflected the light \rfrom her rose-tinted neck, and breathed a divine perfume\rfrom her ambrosial hair: her robes trailed down to her feet,\rand, in her step, showed her a true goddess. He recognised\rhis mother, and as she vanished followed her with his voice:\r\r\rAeneas Recognising Venus as She Disappears in a Cloud\rGiovanni Domenico Tiepolo (Italy, 1727\xc3\x901804)\rYale University Art Gallery\r\r\n\r\xc3\x94You too are cruel, why do you taunt your son with false\rphantoms? Why am I not allowed to join hand\rwith hand, and speak and hear true words?\xc3\x95\rSo he accuses her, and turns his steps towards the city.\rBut Venus veiled them with a dark mist as they walked,\rand, as a goddess, spread a thick covering of cloud around them,\rso that no one could see them, or touch them,\ror cause them delay, or ask them where they were going.\rShe herself soars high in the air, to Paphos, and returns to her home\rwith delight, where her temple and its hundred altars \rsteam with Sabean incense, fragrant with fresh garlands.\r\rBKI:418-463 THE TEMPLE OF JUNO\r\rMeanwhile they\xc3\x95ve tackled the route the path revealed.\rAnd soon they climbed the hill that looms high over the city,\rand looks down from above on the towers that face it.\rAeneas marvels at the mass of buildings, once huts,\rmarvels at the gates, the noise, the paved roads.\rThe eager Tyrians are busy, some building walls,\rand raising the citadel, rolling up stones by hand,\rsome choosing the site for a house, and marking a furrow:\rthey make magistrates and laws, and a sacred senate:\rhere some are digging a harbour: others lay down \rthe deep foundations of a theatre, and carve huge columns\rfrom the cliff, tall adornments for the future stage.\rJust as bees in early summer carry out their tasks \ramong the flowery fields, in the sun, when they lead out\rthe adolescent young of their race, or cram the cells\rwith liquid honey, and swell them with sweet nectar,\ror receive the incoming burdens, or forming lines\rdrive the lazy herd of drones from their hives:\rthe work glows, and the fragrant honey\xc3\x95s sweet with thyme.\r\xc3\x94O fortunate those whose walls already rise!\xc3\x95\rAeneas cries, and admires the summits of the city.\rHe enters among them, veiled in mist (marvellous to tell)\rand mingles with the people seen by no one.\rThere was a grove in the centre of the city, delightful\rwith shade, where the wave and storm-tossed Phoenicians\rfirst uncovered the head of a fierce horse, that regal Juno\rshowed them: so the race would be noted in war, \rand rich in substance throughout the ages.\rHere Sidonian Dido was establishing a great temple\rto Juno, rich with gifts and divine presence,\rwith bronze entrances rising from stairways, and beams\rjointed with bronze, and hinges creaking on bronze doors.\rHere in the grove something new appeared that calmed his fears\rfor the first time, here for the first time Aeneas dared to hope\rfor safety, and to put greater trust in his afflicted fortunes.\rWhile, waiting for the queen, in the vast temple, he looks\rat each thing: while he marvels at the city\xc3\x95s wealth,\rthe skill of their artistry, and the products of their labours,\rhe sees the battles at Troy in their correct order,\rthe War, known through its fame to the whole world,\rthe sons of Atreus, of Priam, and Achilles angered with both.\rHe halted, and said, with tears: \xc3\x94What place is there,\rAchates, what region of earth not full of our hardships?\rSee, Priam! Here too virtue has its rewards, here too\rthere are tears for events, and mortal things touch the heart.\rLose your fears: this fame will bring you benefit.\xc3\x95\r\rBKI:464-493 THE FRIEZE\r\rSo he speaks, and feeds his spirit with the insubstantial frieze,\rsighing often, and his face wet with the streaming tears.\rFor he saw how, here, the Greeks fled, as they fought round Troy,\rchased by the Trojan youth, and, there, the Trojans fled,\rwith plumed Achilles pressing them close in his chariot.\rNot far away, through his tears, he recognises Rhesus\xc3\x95s\rwhite-canvassed tents, that blood-stained Diomede, Tydeus\xc3\x95s son,\rlaid waste with great slaughter, betrayed in their first sleep,\rdiverting the fiery horses to his camp, before they could eat\rTrojan fodder, or drink from the river Xanthus.\rElsewhere Troilus, his weapons discarded in flight,\runhappy boy, unequally matched in his battle with Achilles,\ris dragged by his horses, clinging face-up to the empty chariot,\rstill clutching the reins: his neck and hair trailing\ron the ground, and his spear reversed furrowing the dust.\rMeanwhile the Trojan women with loose hair, walked\rto unjust Pallas\xc3\x95s temple carrying the sacred robe,\rmourning humbly, and beating their breasts with their hands.\rThe goddess was turned away, her eyes fixed on the ground.\rThree times had Achilles dragged Hector round the walls of Troy,\rand now was selling the lifeless corpse for gold.\rThen Aeneas truly heaves a deep sigh, from the depths of his heart,\ras he views the spoils, the chariot, the very body of his friend,\rand Priam stretching out his unwarlike hands.\rHe recognised himself as well, fighting the Greek princes,\rand the Ethiopian ranks and black Memnon\xc3\x95s armour.\rRaging Penthesilea leads the file of Amazons, \rwith crescent shields, and shines out among her thousands, \rher golden girdle fastened beneath her exposed breasts,\ra virgin warrior daring to fight with men. \r\rBKI:494-519 THE ARRIVAL OF QUEEN DIDO\r\rWhile these wonderful sights are viewed by Trojan Aeneas,\rwhile amazed he hangs there, rapt, with fixed gaze,\rQueen Dido, of loveliest form, reached the temple,\rwith a great crowd of youths accompanying her.\rJust as Diana leads her dancing throng on Eurotas\xc3\x95s banks,\ror along the ridges of Cynthus, and, following her,\ra thousand mountain-nymphs gather on either side:\rand she carries a quiver on her shoulder, and overtops\rall the other goddesses as she walks: and delight\rseizes her mother Latona\xc3\x95s silent heart:\rsuch was Dido, so she carried herself, joyfully,\ramongst them, furthering the work, and her rising kingdom.\rThen, fenced with weapons, and resting on a high throne,\rshe took her seat, at the goddess\xc3\x95s doorway, under the central vault.\rShe was giving out laws and statutes to the people, and sharing\rthe workers labour out in fair proportions, or assigning it by lot:\rwhen Aeneas suddenly saw Antheus, and Sergestus, \rand brave Cloanthus, approaching, among a large crowd,\rwith others of the Trojans whom the black storm-clouds\rhad scattered over the sea and carried far off to other shores. \rHe was stunned, and Achates was stunned as well\rwith joy and fear: they burned with eagerness to clasp hands,\rbut the unexpected event confused their minds.\rThey stay concealed and, veiled in the deep mist, they watch\rto see what happens to their friends, what shore they have left \rthe fleet on, and why they are here: the elect of every ship came\rbegging favour, and made for the temple among the shouting. \r\rBKI:520-560 ILIONEUS ASKS HER ASSISTANCE\r\rWhen they\xc3\x95d entered, and freedom to speak in person\rhad been granted, Ilioneus, the eldest, began calmly:\r\xc3\x94O queen, whom Jupiter grants the right to found\ra new city, and curb proud tribes with your justice, \rwe unlucky Trojans, driven by the winds over every sea,\rpray to you: keep the terror of fire away from our ships,\rspare a virtuous race and look more kindly on our fate.\rWe have not come to despoil Libyan homes with the sword,\ror to carry off stolen plunder to the shore: that violence\ris not in our minds, the conquered have not such pride.\rThere\xc3\x95s a place called Hesperia by the Greeks,\ran ancient land, strong in men, with a rich soil:\rThere the Oenotrians lived: now rumour has it \rthat a later people has called it Italy, after their leader.\rWe had set our course there when stormy Orion,\rrising with the tide, carried us onto hidden shoals,\rand fierce winds scattered us far, with the overwhelming surge,\rover the waves among uninhabitable rocks:\rwe few have drifted here to your shores.\rWhat race of men is this? What land is so barbaric as to allow\rthis custom, that we\xc3\x95re denied the hospitality of the sands?\rThey stir up war, and prevent us setting foot on dry land.\rIf you despise the human race and mortal weapons,\rstill trust that the gods remember right and wrong.\rAeneas was our king, no one more just than him\rin his duty, or greater in war and weaponry.\rIf fate still protects the man, if he still enjoys the ethereal air,\rif he doesn\xc3\x95t yet rest among the cruel shades, there\xc3\x95s nothing\rto fear, and you\xc3\x95d not repent of vying with him first in kindness.\rThen there are cities and fields too in the region of Sicily, \rand famous Acestes, of Trojan blood. Allow us\rto beach our fleet, damaged by the storms,\rand cut planks from trees, and shape oars,\rso if our king\xc3\x95s restored and our friends are found\rwe can head for Italy, gladly seek Italy and Latium:\rand if our saviour\xc3\x95s lost, and the Libyan seas hold you,\rTroy\xc3\x95s most virtuous father, if no hope now remains from Iulus,\rlet us seek the Sicilian straits, from which we were driven,\rand the home prepared for us, and a king, Acestes.\xc3\x95\rSo Ilioneus spoke: and the Trojans all shouted with one voice. \r\rBKI:561-585 DIDO WELCOMES THE TROJANS\r\rThen, Dido, spoke briefly, with lowered eyes:\r\xc3\x94Trojans, free your hearts of fear: dispel your cares.\rHarsh events and the newness of the kingdom force me to effect\rsuch things, and protect my borders with guards on all sides.\rWho doesn\xc3\x95t know of Aeneas\xc3\x95s race, and the city of Troy,\rthe bravery, the men, or so great a blaze of warfare,\rindeed, we Phoenicians don\xc3\x95t possess unfeeling hearts,\rthe sun doesn\xc3\x95t harness his horses that far from this Tyrian city.\rWhether you opt for mighty Hesperia, and Saturn\xc3\x95s fields,\ror the summit of Eryx, and Acestes for king,\rI\xc3\x95ll see you safely escorted, and help you with my wealth.\rOr do you wish to settle here with me, as equals in my kingdom?\rThe city I build is yours: beach your ships:\rTrojans and Tyrians will be treated by me without distinction.\rI wish your king Aeneas himself were here, driven\rby that same storm! Indeed, I\xc3\x95ll send reliable men\ralong the coast, and order them to travel the length of Libya,\rin case he\xc3\x95s driven aground, and wandering the woods and towns.\xc3\x95\rBrave Achetes, and our forefather Aeneas, their spirits raised\rby these words, had been burning to break free of the mist.\rAchates was first to speak, saying to Aeneas: \xc3\x94Son of the goddess,\rwhat intention springs to your mind? You see all\xc3\x95s safe,\rthe fleet and our friends have been restored to us.\rOnly one is missing, whom we saw plunged in the waves:\rall else is in accord with your mother\xc3\x95s words.\xc3\x95\r\rBKI:586-612 AENEAS MAKES HIMSELF KNOWN\r\rHe\xc3\x95d scarcely spoken when the mist surrounding them\rsuddenly parted, and vanished in the clear air.\rAeneas stood there, shining in the bright daylight,\rlike a god in shoulders and face: since his mother\rhad herself imparted to her son beauty to his hair,\ra glow of youth, and a joyful charm to his eyes:\rlike the glory art can give to ivory, or as when silver,\ror Parian marble, is surrounded by gold.\rThen he addressed the queen, suddenly, surprising them all,\rsaying: \xc3\x94I am here in person, Aeneas the Trojan,\rhim whom you seek, saved from the Libyan waves. \rO Dido, it is not in our power, nor those of our Trojan race,\rwherever they may be, scattered through the wide world,\rto pay you sufficient thanks, you who alone have pitied\rTroy\xc3\x95s unspeakable miseries, and share your city and home\rwith us, the remnant left by the Greeks, wearied\rby every mischance, on land and sea, and lacking everything.\rMay the gods, and the mind itself conscious of right,\rbring you a just reward, if the gods respect the virtuous,\rif there is justice anywhere.

What Myrmidon,\ror Dolopian, or warrior of fierce Ulysses, could keep\rfrom tears in telling such a story? Now the dew-filled night\ris dropping from the sky, and the setting stars urge sleep.\rBut if you have such desire to learn of our misfortunes,\rand briefly hear of Troy\xc3\x95s last agonies, though my mind\rshudders at the memory, and recoils in sorrow, I\xc3\x95ll begin.\r\xc3\x94After many years have slipped by, the leaders of the Greeks,\ropposed by the Fates, and damaged by the war, \rbuild a horse of mountainous size, through Pallas\xc3\x95s divine art,\rand weave planks of fir over its ribs:\rthey pretend it\xc3\x95s a votive offering: this rumour spreads.\rThey secretly hide a picked body of men, chosen by lot,\rthere, in the dark body, filling the belly and the huge\rcavernous insides with armed warriors. \rTenedos is within sight, an island known to fame,\rrich in wealth when Priam\xc3\x95s kingdom remained,\rnow just a bay and an unsafe anchorage for boats:\rthey sail there, and hide themselves, on the lonely shore.\rWe thought they had gone, and were seeking Mycenae\rwith the wind. So all the Trojan land was free of its long sorrow.\rThe gates were opened: it was a joy to go and see the Greek camp,\rthe deserted site and the abandoned shore.\rHere the Dolopians stayed, here cruel Achilles,\rhere lay the fleet, here they used to meet us in battle.\rSome were amazed at virgin Minerva\xc3\x95s fatal gift,\rand marvel at the horse\xc3\x95s size: and at first Thymoetes, \rwhether through treachery, or because Troy\xc3\x95s fate was certain,\rurged that it be dragged inside the walls and placed on the citadel.\rBut Capys, and those of wiser judgement, commanded us\rto either hurl this deceit of the Greeks, this suspect gift,\rinto the sea, or set fire to it from beneath,\ror pierce its hollow belly, and probe for hiding places.\rThe crowd, uncertain, was split by opposing opinions.\rThen Laoco\xc5\xa1n rushes down eagerly from the heights\rof the citadel, to confront them all, a large crowd with him,\rand shouts from far off: \xc3\x94O unhappy citizens, what madness?\rDo you think the enemy\xc3\x95s sailed away? Or do you think\rany Greek gift\xc3\x95s free of treachery? Is that Ulysses\xc3\x95s reputation?\rEither there are Greeks in hiding, concealed by the wood,\ror it\xc3\x95s been built as a machine to use against our walls,\ror spy on our homes, or fall on the city from above,\ror it hides some other trick: Trojans, don\xc3\x95t trust this horse.\rWhatever it is, I\xc3\x95m afraid of Greeks even those bearing gifts.\xc3\x95\rSo saying he hurled his great spear, with extreme force,\rat the creature\xc3\x95s side, and into the frame of the curved belly.\rThe spear stuck quivering, and at the womb\xc3\x95s reverberation\rthe cavity rang hollow and gave out a groan.\rAnd if the gods\xc3\x95 fate, if our minds, had not been ill-omened,\rhe\xc3\x95d have incited us to mar the Greeks hiding-place with steel: \rTroy would still stand: and you, high tower of Priam would remain.\r\rBKII:57-144 SINON\xc3\x95S TALE\r\rSee, meanwhile, some Trojan shepherds, shouting loudly, \rdragging a youth, his hands tied behind his back, to the king. \rIn order to contrive this, and lay Troy open to the Greeks,\rhe had placed himself in their path, calm in mind, and ready\rfor either course: to engage in deception, or find certain death. \rThe Trojan youth run, crowding round, from all sides,\rto see him, and compete in mocking the captive.\rListen now to Greek treachery, and learn of all their crimes\rfrom just this one. Since, as he stood, looking troubled, \runarmed, amongst the gazing crowd, \rand cast his eyes around the Phrygian ranks,\rhe said: \xc3\x94Ah! What land, what seas would accept me now?\rWhat\xc3\x95s left for me at the last in my misery, I who have\rno place among the Greeks, when the hostile Trojans,\rthemselves, demand my punishment and my blood?\rAt this the mood changed and all violence was checked.\rWe urged him to say what blood he was sprung from,\rand why he suffered: and tell us what trust could be placed\rin him as a captive. Setting fear aside at last he speaks:\r\xc3\x92O king, I\xc3\x95ll tell you the whole truth, whatever happens,\rand indeed I\xc3\x95ll not deny that I\xc3\x95m of Argive birth:\rthis first of all: if Fortune has made me wretched,\rshe\xc3\x95ll not also wrongly make me false and a liar.\rIf by any chance some mention of Palamedes\xc3\x95s name\rhas reached your ears, son of Belus, and talk\rof his glorious fame, he whom the Pelasgians,\ron false charges of treason, by atrocious perjury,\rbecause he opposed the war, sent innocent to his death,\rand who they mourn, now he\xc3\x95s taken from the light:\rwell my father, being poor, sent me here to the war\rwhen I was young, as his friend, as we were blood relatives.\rWhile Palamades was safe in power, and prospered\rin the kings\xc3\x95 council, I also had some name and respect.\rBut when he passed from this world above, through\rthe jealousy of plausible Ulysses (the tale\xc3\x95s not unknown)\rI was ruined, and spent my life in obscurity and grief,\rinwardly angry at the fate of my innocent friend.\rMaddened I could not be silent, and I promised, if chance allowed,\rand if I ever returned as a victor to my native Argos, \rto avenge him, and with my words stirred bitter hatred.\rThe first hint of trouble came to me from this, because of it\rUlysses was always frightening me with new accusations,\rspreading veiled rumours among the people, and guiltily\rseeking to defend himself. He would not rest till, with Calchas\ras his instrument \xc3\x90 but why I do unfold this unwelcome story?\rWhy hinder you? If you consider all Greeks the same,\rand that\xc3\x95s sufficient, take your vengeance now: that\xc3\x95s what\rthe Ithacan wants, and the sons of Atreus would pay dearly for.\xc3\x93\rThen indeed we were on fire to ask, and seek the cause,\rignorant of such wickedness and Pelasgian trickery.\rTrembling with fictitious feelings he continued, saying:\r\xc3\x92The Greeks, weary with the long war, often longed\rto leave Troy and execute a retreat: if only they had! \rOften a fierce storm from the sea land-locked them,\rand the gale terrified them from leaving:\ronce that horse, made of maple-beams, stood there,\respecially then, storm-clouds thundered in the sky.  \rAnxious, we send Eurypylus to consult Phoebus\xc3\x95s oracle,\rand he brings back these dark words from the sanctuary:\r\xc3\x94With blood, and a virgin sacrifice, you calmed the winds,\rO Greeks, when you first came to these Trojan shores, seek your\rreturn in blood, and the well-omened sacrifice of an Argive life.\xc3\x95\rWhen this reached the ears of the crowd, their minds were stunned,\rand an icy shudder ran to their deepest marrow:\rwho readies this fate, whom does Apollo choose? \rAt this the Ithacan thrust the seer, Calchas, into their midst,\rdemanding to know what the god\xc3\x95s will might be,\ramong the uproar. Many were already cruelly prophesying \rthat ingenious man\xc3\x95s wickedness towards me, and silently saw\rwhat was coming. For ten days the seer kept silence, refusing\rto reveal the secret by his words, or condemn anyone to death.\rBut at last, urged on by Ulysses\xc3\x95s loud clamour, he broke\rinto speech as agreed, and doomed me to the altar.\rAll acclaimed it, and what each feared himself, they endured\rwhen directed, alas, towards one man\xc3\x95s destruction.\rNow the terrible day arrived, the rites were being prepared\rfor me, the salted grain, and the headbands for my forehead.\rI confess I saved myself from death, burst my bonds,\rand all that night hid by a muddy lake among the reeds,\rtill they set sail, if as it happened they did.\rAnd now I\xc3\x95ve no hope of seeing my old country again,\ror my sweet children or the father I long for:\rperhaps they\xc3\x95ll seek to punish them for my flight,\rand avenge my crime through the death of these unfortunates.\rBut I beg you, by the gods, by divine power that knows the truth,\rby whatever honour anywhere remains pure among men, have pity\ron such troubles, pity the soul that endures undeserved suffering.\xc3\x93 \r\rBKII:145-194 SINON DELUDES THE TROJANS\r\rWith these tears we grant him his life, and also pity him.\rPriam himself is the first to order his manacles and tight bonds\rremoved, and speaks these words of kindness to him:\r\xc3\x92From now on, whoever you are, forget the Greeks, lost to you:\ryou\xc3\x95ll be one of us. And explain to me truly what I ask: \rWhy have they built this huge hulk of a horse? Who created it?\rWhat do they aim at? What religious object or war machine is it?\xc3\x93\rHe spoke: the other, schooled in Pelasgian art and trickery,\rraised his unbound palms towards the stars, saying:\r\xc3\x92You, eternal fires, in your invulnerable power, be witness, \ryou altars and impious swords I escaped,\ryou sacrificial ribbons of the gods that I wore as victim:\rwith right I break the Greek\xc3\x95s solemn oaths,\rwith right I hate them, and if things are hidden\rbring them to light: I\xc3\x95m bound by no laws of their country.\rOnly, Troy, maintain your assurances, if I speak truth, if I repay\ryou handsomely: kept intact yourself, keep your promises intact.\rAll the hopes of the Greeks and their confidence to begin the war\ralways depended on Pallas\xc3\x95s aid. But from that moment\rwhen the impious son of Tydeus, Diomede, and Ulysses\rinventor of wickedness, approached the fateful Palladium to snatch\rit from its sacred temple, killing the guards on the citadel\xc3\x95s heights,\rand dared to seize the holy statue, and touch the sacred ribbons\rof the goddess with blood-soaked hands: from that moment\rthe hopes of the Greeks receded, and slipping backwards ebbed:\rtheir power fragmented, and the mind of the goddess opposed them.\rPallas gave sign of this, and not with dubious portents,\rfor scarcely was the statue set up in camp, when glittering flames\rshone from the upturned eyes, a salt sweat ran over its limbs, \rand (wonderful to tell) she herself darted from the ground\rwith shield on her arm, and spear quivering. \rCalchas immediately proclaimed that the flight by sea must be\rattempted, and that Troy cannot be uprooted by Argive weapons,\runless they renew the omens at Argos, and take the goddess home,\rwhom they have indeed taken by sea in their curved ships.\rAnd now they are heading for their native Mycenae with the wind,\robtaining weapons and the friendship of the gods, re-crossing \rthe sea to arrive unexpectedly, So Calchas reads the omens. \rWarned by him, they\xc3\x95ve set up this statue of a horse\rfor the wounded goddess, instead of the Palladium,\rto atone severely for their sin. And Calchas ordered them\rto raise the huge mass of woven timbers, raised to the sky,\rso the gates would not take it, nor could it be dragged\rinside the walls, or watch over the people in their ancient rites.\rSince if your hands violated Minerva\xc3\x95s gift,\rthen utter ruin (may the gods first turn that prediction\ron themselves!) would come to Priam and the Trojans:\ryet if it ascended into your citadel, dragged by your hands,\rAsia would come to the very walls of Pelops, in mighty war,\rand a like fate would await our children.\xc3\x93\r\rBKII:195-227 LAOCO\xe2\x80\xa6N AND THE SERPENTS\r\rThrough these tricks and the skill of perjured Sinon, the thing was\rcredited, and we were trapped, by his wiliness, and false tears,\rwe, who were not conquered by Diomede, or Larissan Achilles,\rnor by the ten years of war, nor those thousand ships.\rThen something greater and more terrible befalls\rus wretches, and stirs our unsuspecting souls.\rLaoco\xc5\xa1n, chosen by lot as priest of Neptune,\rwas sacrificing a huge bull at the customary altar.\rSee, a pair of serpents with huge coils, snaking over the sea\rfrom Tenedos through the tranquil deep (I shudder to tell it),\rand heading for the shore side by side: their fronts lift high\rover the tide, and their blood-red crests top the waves,\rthe rest of their body slides through the ocean behind, \rand their huge backs arch in voluminous folds.\rThere\xc3\x95s a roar from the foaming sea: now they reach the shore,\rand with burning eyes suffused with blood and fire,\rlick at their hissing jaws with flickering tongues.\rBlanching at the sight we scatter. They move\ron a set course towards Laoco\xc5\xa1n: and first each serpent \rentwines the slender bodies of his two sons,\rand biting at them, devours their wretched limbs:\rthen as he comes to their aid, weapons in hand, they seize him too,\rand wreathe him in massive coils: now encircling his waist twice,\rtwice winding their scaly folds around his throat, \rtheir high necks and heads tower above him.\rHe strains to burst the knots with his hands,\rhis sacred headband drenched in blood and dark venom,\rwhile he sends terrible shouts up to the heavens,\rlike the bellowing of a bull that has fled wounded,\rfrom the altar, shaking the useless axe from its neck.\rBut the serpent pair escape, slithering away to the high temple,\rand seek the stronghold of fierce Pallas, to hide there\runder the goddess\xc3\x95s feet, and the circle of her shield.\r\rBKII:228-253 THE HORSE ENTERS TROY\r\rThen in truth a strange terror steals through each shuddering heart,\rand they say that Laoco\xc5\xa1n has justly suffered for his crime\rin wounding the sacred oak-tree with his spear,\rby hurling its wicked shaft into the trunk.\r\xc3\x92Pull the statue to her house\xc3\x93, they shout,\r\xc3\x92and offer prayers to the goddess\xc3\x95s divinity.\xc3\x93\rWe breached the wall, and opened up the defences of the city.\rAll prepare themselves for the work and they set up wheels\rallowing movement under its feet, and stretch hemp ropes\rround its neck. That engine of fate mounts our walls\rpregnant with armed men. Around it boys, and virgin girls,\rsing sacred songs, and delight in touching their hands to the ropes:\rUp it glides and rolls threateningly into the midst of the city.\rO my country, O Ilium house of the gods, and you,\rTrojan walls famous in war! Four times it sticks at the threshold\rof the gates, and four times the weapons clash in its belly:\ryet we press on regardless, blind with frenzy,\rand site the accursed creature on top of our sacred citadel.\rEven then Cassandra, who, by the god\xc3\x95s decree, is never \rto be believed by Trojans, reveals our future fate with her lips.\rWe unfortunate ones, for whom that day is our last, \rclothe the gods\xc3\x95 temples, throughout the city, with festive branches.\rMeanwhile the heavens turn, and night rushes from the Ocean,\rwrapping the earth, and sky, and the Myrmidons\xc3\x95 tricks, \rin its vast shadow: through the city the Trojans\rfall silent: sleep enfolds their weary limbs.\r\rBKII:254-297 THE GREEKS TAKE THE CITY\r\rAnd now the Greek phalanx of battle-ready ships sailed\rfrom Tenedos, in the benign stillness of the silent moon,\rseeking the known shore, when the royal galley raised\ra torch, and Sinon, protected by the gods\xc3\x95 unjust doom,\rsets free the Greeks imprisoned by planks of pine,\rin the horses\xc3\x95 belly. Opened, it releases them to the air,\rand sliding down a lowered rope, Thessandrus, and Sthenelus,\rthe leaders, and fatal Ulysses, emerge joyfully\rfrom their wooden cave, with Acamas, Thoas, \rPeleus\xc3\x95s son Neoptolemus, the noble Machaon,\rMenelaus, and Epeus who himself devised this trick.\rThey invade the city that\xc3\x95s drowned in sleep and wine,\rkill the watchmen, welcome their comrades\rat the open gates, and link their clandestine ranks.\rIt was the hour when first sleep begins for weary mortals,\rand steals over them as the sweetest gift of the gods.\rSee, in dream, before my eyes, Hector seemed to stand there,\rsaddest of all and pouring out great tears,\rtorn by the chariot, as once he was, black with bloody dust,\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe Fall of Troy and the Escape of Aeneas\r Giorgio Ghisi (Italy, 1520-1582)\rLACMA Collections\r\r\n\rand his swollen feet pierced by the thongs. \rAh, how he looked!

What shameful events have marred\rthat clear face? And why do I see these wounds?\xc3\x95\rHe does not reply, nor does he wait on my idle questions,\rbut dragging heavy sighs from the depths of his heart, he says:\r\xc3\x92Ah! Son of the goddess, fly, tear yourself from the flames.\rThe enemy has taken the walls: Troy falls from her high place.\rEnough has been given to Priam and your country: if Pergama\rcould be saved by any hand, it would have been saved by this.\rTroy entrusts her sacred relics and household gods to you:\rtake them as friends of your fate, seek mighty walls for them,\rthose you will found at last when you have wandered the seas.\xc3\x93\rSo he speaks, and brings the sacred headbands in his hands\rfrom the innermost shrine, potent Vesta, and the undying flame.\r\rBKII:298-354 AENEAS GATHERS HIS COMRADES\r\rMeanwhile the city is confused with grief, on every side,\rand though my father Anchises\xc3\x95s house is remote, secluded\rand hidden by trees, the sounds grow clearer and clearer,\rand the terror of war sweeps upon it.\rI shake off sleep, and climb to the highest roof-top,\rand stand there with ears strained:\ras when fire attacks a wheat-field when the south-wind rages,\ror the rushing torrent from a mountain stream covers the fields,\rdrowns the ripe crops, the labour of oxen, \rand brings down the trees headlong, and the dazed shepherd,\runaware, hears the echo from a high rocky peak.\rNow the truth is obvious, and the Greek plot revealed.\rNow the vast hall of Deiphobus is given to ruin\rthe fire over it: now Ucalegon\xc3\x95s nearby blazes:\rthe wide Sigean straits throw back the glare.\rThen the clamour of men and the blare of trumpets rises.\rFrantically I seize weapons: not because there is much use\rfor weapons, but my spirit burns to gather men for battle\rand race to the citadel with my friends: madness and anger\rhurl my mind headlong, and I think it beautiful to die fighting.\rNow, see, Panthus escaping the Greek spears,\rPanthus, son of Othrys, Apollo\xc3\x95s priest on the citadel,\rdragging along with his own hands the sacred relics,\rthe conquered gods, his little grandchild, running frantically\rto my door: \xc3\x92Where\xc3\x95s the best advantage, Panthus, what position\rshould we take?\xc3\x93 I\xc3\x95d barely spoken, when he answered\rwith a groan: \xc3\x92The last day comes, Troy\xc3\x95s inescapable hour.\rTroy is past, Ilium is past, and the great glory of the Trojans:\rJupiter carries all to Argos: the Greeks are lords of the burning city. \rThe horse, standing high on the ramparts, pours out warriors,\rand Sinon the conqueror exultantly stirs the flames.\rOthers are at the wide-open gates, as many thousands\ras ever came from great Mycenae: more have blocked\rthe narrow streets with hostile weapons:\ra line of standing steel with naked flickering blades\ris ready for the slaughter: barely the first few guards\rat the gates attempt to fight, and they resist in blind conflict.\xc3\x93\rBy these words from Othrys\xc3\x95 son, and divine will, I\xc3\x95m thrust\ramongst the weapons and the flames, where the dismal Fury\rsounds, and the roar, and the clamour rising to the sky.\rFriends joined me, visible in the moonlight, Ripheus,\rand Epytus, mighty in battle, Hypanis and Dymas, \rgathered to my side, and young Coroebus, Mygdon\xc3\x95s son:\rby chance he\xc3\x95d arrived in Troy at that time,\rburning with mad love for Cassandra, and brought help,\ras a potential son-in-law, to Priam, and the Trojans,\runlucky man, who didn\xc3\x95t listen to the prophecy\rof his frenzied bride! When I saw them crowded there\reager for battle, I began as follows: \xc3\x92Warriors, bravest\rof frustrated spirits, if your ardent desire is fixed\ron following me to the end, you can see our cause\xc3\x95s fate.\rAll the gods by whom this empire was supported\rhave departed, leaving behind their temples and their altars:\ryou aid a burning city: let us die and rush into battle.\rThe beaten have one refuge, to have no hope of refuge.\xc3\x93\r\rBKII:355-401 AENEAS AND HIS FRIENDS RESIST\r\rSo their young spirits were roused to fury. Then, like ravaging\rwolves in a dark mist, driven blindly by the cruel rage \rof their bellies, leaving their young waiting with thirsty jaws,  \rwe pass through our enemies, to certain death, and make our way\rto the heart of the city: dark night envelops us in deep shadow.\rWho could tell of that destruction in words, or equal our pain\rwith tears? The ancient city falls, she who ruled for so many years:\rcrowds of dead bodies lie here and there in the streets,\ramong the houses, and on the sacred thresholds of the gods.\rNor is it Trojans alone who pay the penalty with their blood:\rcourage returns at times to the hearts of the defeated\rand the Greek conquerors die. Cruel mourning is everywhere,\reverywhere there is panic, and many a form of death. \rFirst, Androgeos, meets us, with a great crowd of Greeks\raround him, unknowingly thinking us allied troops,\rand calls to us in friendly speech as well:\r\xc3\x92Hurry, men! What sluggishness makes you delay so?\rThe others are raping and plundering burning Troy:\rare you only now arriving from the tall ships?\xc3\x93\rHe spoke, and straight away (since no reply given was\rcredible enough) he knew he\xc3\x95d fallen into the enemy fold.\rHe was stunned, drew back, and stifled his voice.\rLike a man who unexpectedly treads on a snake in rough briars, \ras he strides over the ground, and shrinks back in sudden fear\ras it rears in anger and swells its dark-green neck,\rso Androgeos, shuddering at the sight of us, drew back.\rWe charge forward and surround them closely with weapons,\rand ignorant of the place, seized by terror, as they are, we slaughter\rthem wholesale. Fortune favours our first efforts.\rAnd at this Coroebus, exultant with courage and success, cries:\r\xc3\x92Oh my friends, where fortune first points out the path to safety,\rand shows herself a friend, let us follow. Let\xc3\x95s change our shields\radopt Greek emblems. Courage or deceit: who\xc3\x95ll question it in war?\rThey\xc3\x95ll arm us themselves.\xc3\x93 With these words, he takes up Androgeos\xc3\x95s\r plumed helmet, his shield with its noble markings,\rand straps the Greek\xc3\x95s sword to his side. Ripheus does likewise,\rDymas too, and all the warriors delight in it.  Each man\rarms himself with the fresh spoils. We pass on\rmingling with the Greeks, with gods that are not our known,\rand clash, in many an armed encounter, in the blind night,\rand we send many a Greek down to Orcus.\rSome scatter to the ships, and run for safer shores,\rsome, in humiliated terror, climb the vast horse again\rand hide in the womb they know. \r\rBKII:402-437 CASSANDRA IS TAKEN\r \r\xc3\x92Ah, put no faith in anything the will of the gods opposes!\rSee, Priam\xc3\x95s virgin daughter dragged, with streaming hair,\rfrom the sanctuary and temple of Minerva,\rlifting her burning eyes to heaven in vain:\rher eyes, since cords restrained her gentle hands.\rCoroebus could not stand the sight, maddened in mind,\rand hurled himself among the ranks, seeking death.\rWe follow him, and, weapons locked, charge together.\rHere, at first, we were overwhelmed by Trojan spears,\rhurled from the high summit of the temple,\rand wretched slaughter was caused by the look of our armour,\rand the confusion arising from our Greek crests.\rThen the Danaans, gathering from all sides, groaning with anger\rat the girl being pulled away from them, rush us, \rAjax the fiercest, the two Atrides, all the Greek host:\rjust as, at the onset of a tempest, conflicting winds clash, the west,\rthe south, and the east that joys in the horses of dawn:\rthe forest roars, brine-wet Nereus rages with his trident,\rand stirs the waters from their lowest depths.\rEven those we have scattered by a ruse, in the dark of night,\rand driven right through the city, re-appear: for the first time\rthey recognise our shields and deceitful weapons,\rand realise our speech differs in sound to theirs.\rIn a moment we\xc3\x95re overwhelmed by weight of numbers:\rfirst Coroebus falls, by the armed goddess\xc3\x95s altar, at the hands\rof Peneleus: and Ripheus, who was the most just of all the Trojans,\rand keenest for what was right (the gods\xc3\x95 vision was otherwise):\rHypanis and Dymas die at the hands of allies:\rand your great piety, Panthus, and Apollo\xc3\x95s sacred headband\rcan not defend you in your downfall.\rAshes of Ilium, death flames of my people, be witness\rthat, at your ruin, I did not evade the Danaan weapons,\rnor the risks, and, if it had been my fate to die,\rI earned it with my sword. Then we are separated,\rIphitus and Pelias with me, Iphitus weighed down by the years,\rand Pelias, slow-footed, wounded by Ulysses:\rimmediately we\xc3\x95re summoned to Priam\xc3\x95s palace by the clamour.\r\rBKII:438-485 THE BATTLE FOR THE PALACE\r\rHere\xc3\x95s a great battle indeed, as if the rest of the war were nothing,\ras if others were not dying throughout the whole city,\rso we see wild War and the Greeks rushing to the palace,\rand the entrance filled with a press of shields.\rLadders cling to the walls: men climb the stairs under the very\rdoorposts, with their left hands holding defensive shields\ragainst the spears, grasping the sloping stone with their right.\rIn turn, the Trojans pull down the turrets and roof-tiles\rof the halls, prepared to defend themselves even in death,\rseeing the end near them, with these as weapons:\rand send the gilded roof-beams down, the glory\rof their ancient fathers. Others with naked swords block\rthe inner doors: these they defend in massed ranks.\rOur spirits were reinspired, to bring help to the king\xc3\x95s palace,\rto relieve our warriors with our aid, and add power to the beaten.\rThere was an entrance with hidden doors, and a passage in use\rbetween Priam\xc3\x95s halls, and a secluded gateway beyond,\rwhich the unfortunate Andromache, while the kingdom stood,\roften used to traverse, going, unattended, to her husband\xc3\x95s parents,\rtaking the little Astyanax to his grandfather.\rI reached the topmost heights of the pediment from which\rthe wretched Trojans were hurling their missiles in vain.\rA turret standing on the sloping edge, and rising from the roof\rto the sky, was one from which all Troy could be seen,\rthe Danaan ships, and the Greek camp: and attacking its edges\rwith our swords, where the upper levels offered weaker mortar,\rwe wrenched it from its high place, and sent it flying:\rfalling suddenly it dragged all to ruin with a roar,\rand shattered far and wide over the Greek ranks.\rBut more arrived, and meanwhile neither the stones\rnor any of the various missiles ceased to fly. \rIn front of the courtyard itself, in the very doorway of the palace,\rPyrrhus exults, glittering with the sheen of bronze:\rlike a snake, fed on poisonous herbs, in the light, \rthat cold winter has held, swollen, under the ground,\rand now, gleaming with youth, its skin sloughed,\rripples its slimy back, lifts its front high towards the sun,\rand darts its triple-forked tongue from its jaws. \rHuge Periphas, and Automedon the armour-bearer,\rdriver of Achilles\xc3\x95s team, and all the Scyrian youths,\radvance on the palace together and hurl firebrands onto the roof.\rPyrrhus himself among the front ranks, clutching a double-axe,\rbreaks through the stubborn gate, and pulls the bronze doors\rfrom their hinges: and now, hewing out the timber, he breaches\rthe solid oak and opens a huge window with a gaping mouth.\rThe palace within appears, and the long halls are revealed:\rthe inner sanctums of Priam, and the ancient kings, appear,\rand armed men are seen standing on the very threshold.\r\rBKII:486-558 PRIAM\xc3\x95S FATE\r\rBut, inside the palace, groans mingle with sad confusion,\rand, deep within, the hollow halls howl\rwith women\xc3\x95s cries: the clamour strikes the golden stars.\rTrembling mothers wander the vast building, clasping \rthe doorposts, and placing kisses on them. Pyrrhus drives forward,\rwith his father Achilles\xc3\x95s strength, no barricades nor the guards\rthemselves can stop him: the door collapses under the ram\xc3\x95s blows,\rand the posts collapse, wrenched from their sockets.\rStrength makes a road: the Greeks, pour through, force a passage,\rslaughter the front ranks, and fill the wide space with their men.\rA foaming river is not so furious, when it floods, \rbursting its banks, overwhelms the barriers against it,\rand rages in a mass through the fields, sweeping cattle and stables\racross the whole plain. I saw Pyrrhus myself, on the threshold,\rmad with slaughter, and the two sons of Atreus:\rI saw Hecuba, her hundred women, and Priam at the altars,\rpolluting with blood the flames that he himself had sanctified.\rThose fifty chambers, the promise of so many offspring,\rthe doorposts, rich with spoils of barbarian gold,\rcrash down: the Greeks possess what the fire spares. \rAnd maybe you ask, what was Priam\xc3\x95s fate.\rWhen he saw the end of the captive city, the palace doors\rwrenched away, and the enemy among the inner rooms,\rthe aged man clasped his long-neglected armour\ron his old, trembling shoulders, and fastened on his useless sword, \rand hurried into the thick of the enemy seeking death.\rIn the centre of the halls, and under the sky\xc3\x95s naked arch,\rwas a large altar, with an ancient laurel nearby, that leant\ron the altar, and clothed the household gods with shade.\rHere Hecuba, and her daughters, like doves driven\rby a dark storm, crouched uselessly by the shrines,\rhuddled together, clutching at the statues of the gods.\rAnd when she saw Priam himself dressed in youthful armour\rshe cried: \xc3\x92What mad thought, poor husband, urges you\rto fasten on these weapons? Where do you run? \rThe hour demands no such help, nor defences such as these,\rnot if my own Hector were here himself. Here, I beg you,\rthis altar will protect us all or we\xc3\x95ll die together.\xc3\x93 \rSo she spoke and drew the old man towards her,\rand set him down on the sacred steps.\rSee, Polites, one of Priam\xc3\x95s sons, escaping Pyrrhus\xc3\x95s slaughter,\rruns down the long hallways, through enemies and spears,\rand, wounded, crosses the empty courts.\rPyrrhus chases after him, eager to strike him,\rand grasps at him now, and now, with his hand, at spear-point.\rWhen finally he reached the eyes and gaze of his parents,\rhe fell, and poured out his life in a river of blood.\rPriam, though even now in death\xc3\x95s clutches,\rdid not spare his voice at this, or hold back his anger:\r\xc3\x92If there is any justice in heaven, that cares about such things,\rmay the gods repay you with fit thanks, and due reward\rfor your wickedness, for such acts, you who have\rmade me see my own son\xc3\x95s death in front of my face, \rand defiled a father\xc3\x95s sight with murder. \rYet Achilles, whose son you falsely claim to be, was no\rsuch enemy to Priam: he respected the suppliant\xc3\x95s rights, \rand honour, and returned Hector\xc3\x95s bloodless corpse \rto its sepulchre, and sent me home to my kingdom.\xc3\x93\rSo the old man spoke, and threw his ineffectual spear\rwithout strength, which immediately spun from the clanging bronze\rand hung uselessly from the centre of the shield\xc3\x95s boss. \rPyrrhus spoke to him: \xc3\x92Then you can be messenger, carry\rthe news to my father, to Peleus\xc3\x95s son: remember to tell him\rof degenerate Pyrrhus, and of my sad actions:\rnow die.\xc3\x93 Saying this he dragged him, trembling, \rand slithering in the pool of his son\xc3\x95s blood,  to the very altar,\rand twined his left hand in his hair, raised the glittering sword\rin his right, and buried it to the hilt in his side.\rThis was the end of Priam\xc3\x95s life: this was the death that fell to him\rby lot, seeing Troy ablaze and its citadel toppled, he who was\ronce the magnificent ruler of so many Asian lands and peoples.\rA once mighty body lies on the shore, the head\rshorn from its shoulders, a corpse without a name.\r\rBKII:559-587 AENEAS SEES HELEN\r \rThen for the first time a wild terror gripped me. \rI stood amazed: my dear father\xc3\x95s image rose before me\ras I saw a king, of like age, with a cruel wound,\rbreathing his life away: and my Creusa, forlorn, \rand the ransacked house, and the fate of little Iulus.\rI looked back, and considered the troops that were round me.\rThey had all left me, wearied, and hurled their bodies to earth,\ror sick with misery dropped into the flames.\rSo I was alone now, when I saw the daughter of Tyndareus,\rHelen, close to Vesta\xc3\x95s portal, hiding silently\rin the secret shrine: the bright flames gave me light,\ras I wandered, gazing everywhere, randomly.\rAfraid of Trojans angered at the fall of Troy, \rGreek vengeance, and the fury of a husband she deserted,\rshe, the mutual curse of Troy and her own country,\rhad concealed herself and crouched, a hated thing, by the altars.\rFire blazed in my spirit: anger rose to avenge my fallen land,\rand to exact the punishment for her wickedness.\r\xc3\x92Shall she, unharmed, see Sparta again and her native Mycenae,\rand see her house and husband, parents and children,\rand go in the triumphant role of a queen,\rattended by a crowd of Trojan women and Phrygian servants?\rWhen Priam has been put to the sword? Troy consumed with fire?\rThe Dardanian shore soaked again and again with blood?\rNo. Though there\xc3\x95s no great glory in a woman\xc3\x95s punishment,\rand such a conquest wins no praise, still I will be praised\rfor extinguishing wickedness and exacting well-earned\rpunishment, and I\xc3\x95ll delight in having filled my soul\rwith the flame of revenge, and appeased my  people\xc3\x95s ashes.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\rBKII:588-623 AENEAS IS VISITED BY HIS MOTHER VENUS\r\rI blurted out these words, and was rushing on with raging mind,\rwhen my dear mother came to my vision, never before so bright\rto my eyes, shining with pure light in the night,\rgoddess for sure, such as she may be seen by the gods,\rand taking me by the right hand, stopped me, and, then,\rimparted these words to me from her rose-tinted lips:\r\xc3\x92My son, what pain stirs such uncontrollable anger?\rWhy this rage? Where has your care for what is ours vanished?\rFirst will you not see whether Creusa, your wife, and your child\rAscanius still live, and where you have left your father Anchises\rworn-out with age? The Greek ranks surround them on all sides,\rand if my love did not protect them, the flames would have caught\rthem before now, and the enemy swords drunk of their blood.\rYou do not hate the face of the Spartan daughter of Tyndareus,\rnor is Paris to blame: the ruthlessness of the gods, of the gods,\rbrought down this power, and toppled Troy from its heights.\rSee (for I\xc3\x95ll tear away all the mist that now, shrouding your sight,\rdims your mortal vision, and darkens everything with moisture:\rdon\xc3\x95t be afraid of what your mother commands, or refuse to obey\rher wisdom): here, where you see shattered heaps of stone\rtorn from stone, and smoke billowing mixed with dust,\rNeptune is shaking the walls, and the foundations, stirred\rby his mighty trident, and tearing the whole city up by it roots.\rThere, Juno, the fiercest, is first to take the Scaean Gate, and,\rsword at her side, calls on her troops from the ships, in rage.\rNow, see, Tritonian Pallas, standing on the highest towers,\rsending lightning from the storm-cloud, and her grim Gorgon\rbreastplate. Father Jupiter himself supplies the Greeks with\rcourage, and fortunate strength, himself excites the gods against\rthe Trojan army. Hurry your departure, son, and put an end \rto your efforts. I will not leave you, and I will place you\rsafe at your father\xc3\x95s door.\xc3\x93 She spoke, and hid herself\rin the dense shadows of night. Dreadful shapes appeared,\rand the vast powers of gods opposed to Troy.\r\r\r\r\r\r\rHelen Saved by Venus from the Wrath of Aeneas\rJacques Sablet (Switzerland, 1749-1803)\rLACMA Collections\r\r\n\rBKII:624-670 AENEAS FINDS HIS FAMILY\r\rThen in truth all Ilium seemed to me to sink in flames,\rand Neptune\xc3\x95s Troy was toppled from her base:\rjust as when foresters on the mountain heights\rcompete to uproot an ancient ash tree, struck\rtime and again by axe and blade, it threatens continually\rto fall, with trembling foliage and shivering crown,\rtill gradually vanquished by the blows it groans at last,\rand torn from the ridge, crashes down in ruin.\rI descend, and, led by a goddess, am freed from flames\rand enemies: the spears give way, and the flames recede.\rAnd now, when I reached the threshold of my father\xc3\x95s house,\rand my former home, my father, whom it was my first desire \rto carry into the high mountains, and whom I first sought out,\rrefused to extend his life or endure exile, since Troy had fallen.\r\xc3\x92Oh, you,\xc3\x93 he cried, \xc3\x92whose blood has the vigour of youth,\rand whose power is unimpaired in its force, it\xc3\x95s for you\rto take flight.

Clinging to old age for so long,\rI am useless, and hated by the gods, ever since\rthe father of the gods and ruler of men breathed the winds \rof his lightning-bolt onto me, and touched me with fire.\xc3\x93\rSo he persisted in saying, and remained adamant.\rWe, on our side, Creusa, my wife, and Ascanius, all our household,\rweeping bitterly, determined that he should not destroy everything\ralong with himself, and crush us by urging our doom.\rHe refused and clung to his place and his purpose.\rI hurried to my weapons again, and, miserably, longed for death,\rsince what tactic or opportunity was open to us now?\r\xc3\x92Did you think I could leave you, father, and depart?\rDid such sinful words fall from your lips?\rIf it pleases the gods to leave nothing of our great city standing,\rif this is set in your mind, if it delights you to add yourself\rand all that\xc3\x95s yours to the ruins of Troy, the door is open\rto that death: soon Pyrrhus comes, drenched in Priam\xc3\x95s blood,\rhe who butchers the son in front of the father, the father at the altar. \rKind mother, did you rescue me from fire and sword\rfor this, to see the enemy in the depths of my house, \rand Ascanius, and my father, and Creusa, slaughtered, \rthrown together in a heap, in one another\xc3\x95s blood?\rWeapons men, bring weapons: the last day calls to the defeated.\rLead me to the Greeks again: let me revisit the battle anew.\rThis day we shall not all perish unavenged.\xc3\x93\r\rBKII:671-704 THE OMEN\r\rSo, again, I fasten on my sword, slip my left arm\rinto the shield\xc3\x95s strap, adjust it, and rush from the house.\rBut see, my wife clings to the threshold, clasps my foot,\rand holds little Iulus up towards his father:\r\xc3\x92If you go to die, take us with you too, at all costs: but if\ras you\xc3\x95ve proved you trust in the weapons you wear,\rdefend this house first.

Banish these tears for your beloved Creusa.\rI, a Trojan woman, and daughter-in-law to divine Venus,\rshall never see the noble halls of the Dolopians,\ror Myrmidons, or go as slave to some Greek wife:\rinstead the great mother of the gods keeps me on this shore.\rNow farewell, and preserve your love for the son we share.\xc3\x93\rWhen she had spoken these words, leaving me weeping\rand wanting to say so many things, she faded into thin air.\rThree times I tried to throw my arms about her neck:\rthree times her form fled my hands, clasped in vain,\rlike the light breeze, most of all like a winged dream.\rSo at last when night was done, I returned to my friends.\r\r\rBKII:796-804 AENEAS LEAVES TROY\r\rAnd here, amazed, I found that a great number of new\rcompanions had streamed in, women and men, \ra crowd gathering for exile, a wretched throng.\rThey had come from all sides, ready, with courage and wealth,\rfor whatever land I wished to lead them to, across the seas.\rAnd now Lucifer was rising above the heights of Ida,\rbringing the dawn, and the Greeks held the barricaded\rentrances to the gates, nor was there any hope of rescue.\rI desisted, and, carrying my father, took to the hills.\r\r\r\n\r\n\r\rBOOK III\r\r\rBKIII:1-18 AENEAS SAILS TO THRACE\r\rAfter the gods had seen fit to destroy Asia\xc3\x95s power\rand Priam\xc3\x95s innocent people, and proud Ilium had fallen,\rand all of Neptune\xc3\x95s Troy breathed smoke from the soil,\rwe were driven by the gods\xc3\x95 prophecies to search out\rdistant exile, and deserted lands, and we built a fleet\rbelow Antandros and the peaks of Phrygian Ida, unsure \rwhere fate would carry us, or where we\xc3\x95d be allowed to settle, \rand we gathered our forces together. Summer had barely begun, \rwhen Anchises, my father, ordered us to set sail with destiny:\rI left my native shore with tears, the harbour and the fields\rwhere Troy once stood. I travelled the deep, an exile,\rwith my friends and my son, and the great gods of our house.\rFar off is a land of vast plains where Mars is worshipped\r(worked by the Thracians) once ruled by fierce Lycurgus,\ra friend of Troy in the past, and with gods who were allies,\rwhile fortune lasted. I went there, and founded my first city\rnamed Aeneadae from my name, on the shore\rin the curving bay, beginning it despite fate\xc3\x95s adversity.\r\rBKIII:19-68 THE GRAVE OF POLYDORUS\r \rI was making a sacrifice to the gods, and my mother Venus, \rDione\xc3\x95s daughter, with auspices for the work begun, and had killed\ra fine bull on the shore, for the supreme king of the sky-lords.\rBy chance, there was a mound nearby, crowned with cornel\rbushes, and bristling with dense spikes of myrtle.\rI went near, and trying to tear up green wood from the soil\rto decorate the altar with leafy branches, I saw\ra wonder, dreadful and marvellous to tell of.\rFrom the first bush, its broken roots torn from the ground,\rdrops of dark blood dripped, and stained the earth with fluid.\rAn icy shiver gripped my limbs, and my blood chilled with terror.\rAgain I went on to pluck a stubborn shoot from another,\rprobing the hidden cause within: and dark blood\rflowed from the bark of the second. Troubled greatly\rin spirit, I prayed to the Nymphs of the wild,\rand father Gradivus, who rules the Thracian fields,\rto look with due kindness on this vision, and lessen\rits significance. But when I attacked the third\rwith greater effort, straining with my knees against the sand\r(to speak or be silent?), a mournful groan was audible\rfrom deep in the mound, and a voice came to my ears: \r\xc3\x92Why do you wound a poor wretch, Aeneas? Spare me now\rin my tomb, don\xc3\x95t stain your virtuous hands, Troy bore me,\rwho am no stranger to you, nor does this blood flow from \rsome dull block. Oh, leave this cruel land: leave this shore\rof greed. For I am Polydorus. Here a crop of iron spears\rcarpeted my transfixed corpse, and has ripened into sharp spines.\xc3\x93\rThen truly I was stunned, my mind crushed by anxious dread,\rmy hair stood up on end, and my voice stuck in my throat. \rPriam, the unfortunate, seeing the city encircled by the siege, \rand despairing of Trojan arms, once sent this Polydorus, secretly, \rwith a great weight of gold, to be raised, by the Thracian king.\rWhen the power of Troy was broken, and her fortunes ebbed,\rthe Thracian broke every divine law, to follow Agamemnon\xc3\x95s\rcause, and his victorious army, murders Polydorus, and takes\rthe gold by force. Accursed hunger for gold, to what do you \rnot drive human hearts! When terror had left my bones\rI referred this divine vision to the people\xc3\x95s appointed leaders,\rmy father above all, and asked them what they thought.\rAll were of one mind, to leave this wicked land, and depart\ra place of hospitality defiled, and sail our fleet before the wind.\rSo we renewed the funeral rites for Polydorus, and piled\rthe earth high on his barrow: sad altars were raised\rto the Shades, with dark sacred ribbons and black cypress, \rthe Trojan women around, hair streaming, \ras is the custom: we offered foaming bowls of warm milk,\rand dishes of sacrificial blood, and bound the spirit\rto its tomb, and raised a loud shout of farewell. \r\rBKIII:69-120 THE TROJANS REACH DELOS\r\rThen as soon as we\xc3\x95ve confidence in the waves, and the winds\rgrant us calm seas, and the soft whispering breeze calls to the deep,\rmy companions float the ships and crowd to the shore.\rWe set out from harbour, and lands and cities recede.\rIn the depths of the sea lies a sacred island, dearest of all\rto the mother of the Nereids, and Aegean Neptune,\rthat wandered by coasts and shores, until Apollo,\raffectionately, tied it to high Myconos, and Gyaros,\rmaking it fixed and inhabitable, scorning the storms.\rI sail there: it welcomes us peacefully, weary as we are,\rto its safe harbour. Landing, we do homage to Apollo\xc3\x95s city.\rKing Anius, both king of the people and high-priest of Apollo,\rhis forehead crowned with the sacred headband and holy laurel,\rmeets us, and recognises an old friend in Anchises:\rwe clasp hands in greeting and enter his house.\rI paid homage to the god\xc3\x95s temple of ancient stone:\r\xc3\x92Grant us a true home, Apollo, grant a weary people walls, \rand a race, and a city that will endure: protect this second\rcitadel of Troy, that survives the Greeks and pitiless Achilles.\rWhom should we follow? Where do you command us to go? \rWhere should we settle? Grant us an omen, father, to stir our hearts.\rI had scarcely spoken: suddenly everything seemed to tremble,\rthe god\xc3\x95s thresholds and his laurel crowns, and the whole hill\rround us moved, and the tripod groaned as the shrine split open.\rHumbly we seek the earth, and a voice comes to our ears:\r\xc3\x92Enduring Trojans, the land which first bore you from its\rparent stock, that same shall welcome you, restored, to its\rfertile breast. Search out your ancient mother.\rThere the house of Aeneas shall rule all shores,\rhis children\xc3\x95s children, and those that are born to them.\xc3\x93\rSo Phoebus spoke: and there was a great shout of joy mixed\rwith confusion, and all asked what walls those were, and where\rit is Phoebus calls the wanderers to, commanding them to return.\rThen my father, thinking of the records of the ancients, said:\r\xc3\x92Listen, O princes, and learn what you may hope for.\rCrete lies in the midst of the sea, the island of mighty Jove,\rwhere Mount Ida is, the cradle of our race.\rThey inhabit a hundred great cities, in the richest of kingdoms,\rfrom which our earliest ancestor, Teucer, if I remember the tale\rrightly, first sailed to Trojan shores, and chose a site\rfor his royal capital. Until then Ilium and the towers of the citadel\rdid not stand there: men lived in the depths of the valleys.\rThe Mother who inhabits Cybele is Cretan, and the cymbals\rof the Corybantes, and the grove of Ida: from Crete came\rthe faithful silence of her rites, and the yoked lions\rdrawing the lady\xc3\x95s chariot. So come, and let us follow\rwhere the god\xc3\x95s command may lead, let us placate\rthe winds, and seek out the Cretan kingdom. \rIt is no long journey away: if only Jupiter is with us,\rthe third dawn will find our fleet on the Cretan shores.\xc3\x93\rSo saying, he sacrificed the due offerings at the altars,\ra bull to Neptune, a bull to you, glorious Apollo, a black sheep\rto the Storm god, a white to the auspicious Westerlies.\r\rBKIII:121-171 THE PLAGUE AND A VISION\r \rA rumour spread that Prince Idomeneus had been driven\rfrom his father\xc3\x95s kingdom, and the Cretan shores were deserted,\rher houses emptied of enemies, and the abandoned homes\rwaiting for us. We left Ortygia\xc3\x95s harbour, and sped over the sea,\rthreading the foaming straits thick with islands, Naxos\rwith its Bacchic worship in the hills, green Donysa, Olearos,\rsnow-white Paros, and the Cyclades, scattered over the waters.\rThe sailors\xc3\x95 cries rose, as they competed in their various tasks:\rthe crew shouted: \xc3\x92We\xc3\x95re headed for Crete, and our ancestors.\xc3\x93\rA wind rising astern sent us on our way, and at last \rwe glided by the ancient shores of the Curetes.\rThen I worked eagerly on the walls of our chosen city, and called\rit Pergamum, and exhorted my people, delighting in the name, \rto show love for their homes, and build a covered fortress.\rNow the ships were usually beached on the dry sand:\rthe young men were busy with weddings and their fresh fields:\rI was deciding on laws and homesteads: suddenly, \rfrom some infected region of the sky, came a wretched plague,\rcorrupting bodies, trees, and crops, and a season of death.\rThey relinquished sweet life, or dragged their sick limbs\raround: then Sirius blazed over barren fields:\rthe grass withered, and the sickly harvest denied its fruits.\rMy father urged us to retrace the waves, and revisit\rthe oracle of Apollo at Delos, and beg for protection,\rask where the end might be to our weary fate, where he commands\rthat we seek help for our trouble, where to set our course.\rIt was night, and sleep had charge of earth\xc3\x95s creatures:\rThe sacred statues of the gods, the Phrygian Penates,\rthat I had carried with me from Troy, out of the burning city,\rseemed to stand there before my eyes, as I lay in sleep,\rperfectly clear in the light, where the full moon\rstreamed through the window casements: then they spoke\rto me and with their words dispelled my cares:\r\xc3\x92Apollo speaks here what he would say to you, on reaching Delos,\rand sends us besides, as you see, to your threshold.\rWhen Try burned we followed you and your weapons,\rwe crossed the swelling seas with you on your ships,\rwe too shall raise your descendants yet to be, to the stars,\rand grant empire to your city. Build great walls for the great,\rand do not shrink from the long labour of exile.\rChange your country. These are not the shores that Delian\rApollo urged on you, he did not order you to settle in Crete.\rThere is a place the Greeks call Hesperia by name,\ran ancient land powerful in arms and in richness of the soil:\rThere the Oenotrians lived: now the rumour is that\ra younger race has named it Italy after their leader.\rThat is our true home, Dardanus and father Iasius, \rfrom whom our race first came, sprang from there.\rCome, bear these words of truth joyfully to your old father,\rthat he might seek Corythus and Ausonia\xc3\x95s lands:\rJupiter denies the fields of Dicte to you.\xc3\x93\r\rBKIII:172-208 THE TROJANS LEAVE CRETE FOR ITALY\r\rAmazed by such a vision, and the voices of the gods,\r(it was not a dream, but I seemed to recognise their expression,\rbefore me, their wreathed hair, their living faces:\rthen a cold sweat bathed all my limbs)\rmy body leapt from the bed, and I lifted my voice\rand upturned palms to heaven, and offered pure \rgifts on the hearth-fire. The rite completed, with joy\rI told Anchises of this revelation, revealing it all in order.\rHe understood about the ambiguity in our origins, and the dual\rdescent, and that he had been deceived by a fresh error, \rabout our ancient country. Then he spoke: \xc3\x92My son, troubled \rby Troy\xc3\x95s fate, Only Cassandra prophesied such an outcome.\rNow I remember her foretelling that this was destined for our race,\rand often spoke of Hesperia, and the Italian kingdom.\rWho\xc3\x95d believe that Trojans would travel to Hesperia\xc3\x95s shores?\rWho\xc3\x95d have been moved by Cassandra, the prophetess, then? \rLet\xc3\x95s trust to Apollo, and, warned by him, take the better course.\xc3\x93\rSo he spoke, and we were delighted to obey his every word.\rWe departed this home as well, and, leaving some people behind,\rset sail, and ran through the vast ocean in our hollow ships.\rWhen the fleet had reached the high seas and the land\rwas no longer seen, sky and ocean on all sides, then \ra dark-blue rain cloud settled overhead, bringing\rnight and storm, and the waves bristled with shadows.\rImmediately the winds rolled over the water and great seas rose:\rwe were scattered here and there in the vast abyss.\rStorm-clouds shrouded the day, and the night mists\rhid the sky: lightning flashed again from the torn clouds.\rWe were thrown off course, and wandered the blind waves.\rPalinurus himself was unable to tell night from day in the sky,\rand could not determine his path among the waves.\rSo for three days, and as many starless nights, \rwe wandered uncertainly, in a dark fog, over the sea.\rAt last, on the fourth day, land was first seen to rise,\rrevealing far off mountains and rolling smoke.\rThe sails fell, we stood to the oars: without pause, the sailors, \rat full stretch, churned the foam, and swept the blue sea.\r\rBKIII:209-277 THE HARPIES\r\rFree of the waves I\xc3\x95m welcomed first by the shores\rof the Strophades, the Clashing Islands. The Strophades\rare fixed now in the great Ionian Sea, but are called\rby the Greek name. There dread Celaeno and the rest\rof the Harpies live, since Phineus\xc3\x95s house was denied them,\rand they left his tables where they fed, in fear.\rNo worse monsters than these, no crueller plague,\rever rose from the waters of Styx, at the gods\xc3\x95 anger.\rThese birds have the faces of virgin girls,\rfoulest excrement flowing from their bellies, \rclawed hands, and faces always thin with hunger.\rNow when, arriving here, we enter port,\rwe see fat herds of cattle scattered over the plains,\rand flocks of goats, unguarded, in the meadows.\rWe rush at them with our swords, calling on Jove himself\rand the gods to join us in our plunder: then we build\rseats on the curving beach, and feast on the rich meats.\rBut suddenly the Harpies arrive, in a fearsome swoop\rfrom the hills, flapping their wings with a huge noise,\rsnatching at the food, and fouling everything with their\rfilthy touch: then there\xc3\x95s a deadly shriek amongst the foul stench.\rWe set out the tables again, and relight the altar fires,\rin a deep recess under an overhanging rock,\rclosed off by trees and trembling shadows:\ragain from another part of the sky, some hidden lair,\rthe noisy crowd hovers, with taloned feet around their prey,\rpolluting the food with their mouths. Then I order my friends\rto take up their weapons and make war on that dreadful race.\rThey do exactly that, obeying orders, placing hidden swords\rin the grass, and burying their shields out of sight.\rThen when the birds swoop, screaming, along the curved beach,\rMisenus, from his high lookout, gives the signal on hollow bronze.\rMy friends charge, and, in a new kind of battle, attempt\rto wound these foul ocean birds with their swords.\rBut they don\xc3\x95t register the blows to their plumage, or the wounds\rto their backs, they flee quickly, soaring beneath the heavens, \rleaving behind half-eaten food, and the traces of their filth.\rOnly Celaeno, ominous prophetess, settles on a high cliff, \rand bursts out with this sound from her breast:\r\xc3\x92Are you ready to bring war to us, sons of Laomedon, is it war, \rfor the cows you killed, the bullocks you slaughtered,\rdriving the innocent Harpies from their father\xc3\x95s country?\rTake these words of mine to your hearts then, and set them there.\rI, the eldest of the Furies, reveal to you what the all-powerful\rFather prophesied to Apollo, and Phoebus Apollo to me.\rItaly is the path you take, and, invoking the winds,\ryou shall go to Italy, and enter her harbours freely:\rbut you will not surround the city granted you with walls\runtil dire hunger, and the sin of striking at us, force you\rto consume your very tables with devouring jaws.\xc3\x93\rShe spoke, and fled back to the forest borne by her wings.\rBut my companions\xc3\x95 chill blood froze with sudden fear:\rtheir courage dropped, and they told me to beg for peace,\rwith vows and prayers, forgoing weapons,\rno matter if these were goddesses or fatal, vile birds.\rAnd my father Anchises, with outstretched hands, on the shore,\rcalled to the great gods and declared the due sacrifice:\r\xc3\x92Gods, avert these threats, gods, prevent these acts,\rand, in peace, protect the virtuous!\xc3\x93 Then he ordered us\rto haul in the cables from the shore, unfurl and spread the sails.\rSouth winds stretched the canvas: we coursed over foaming seas,\rwherever the winds and the helmsman dictated our course.\rNow wooded Zacynthus appeared amongst the waves,\rDulichium, Same and Neritos\xc3\x95s steep cliffs.\rWe ran past Laertes\xc3\x95s kingdom, Ithacas\xc3\x95s reefs,\rand cursed the land that reared cruel Ulysses.\rSoon the cloudy heights of Mount Leucata were revealed,\ras well, and Apollo\xc3\x95s headland, feared by sailors.\rWe headed wearily for it, and approached the little town:\rthe anchor was thrown from the prow, the stern rested on the beach.\r\rBKIII:278-293 THE GAMES AT ACTIUM\r\rSo, beyond hope, achieving land at last, we purify\rourselves for Jove, and light offerings on the altars, \rand celebrate Trojan games on the shore of Actium.\rMy naked companions, slippery with oil,\rindulge in the wrestling-bouts of their homeland:\rit\xc3\x95s good to have slipped past so many Greek cities\rand held our course in flight through the midst of the enemy.\rMeanwhile the sun rolls through the long year\rand icy winter stirs the waves with northerly gales:\rI fix a shield of hollow bronze, once carried by mighty Abas,\ron the entrance pillars, and mark the event with a verse:\r\rAENEAS OFFERS THIS ARMOUR FROM CONQUERING GREEKS\r\rthen I order them to man the benches and leave harbour:\rin rivalry, my friends strike the sea and sweep the waves.\rWe soon leave behind the windblown heights of Phaeacia,\rpass the shores of Epirus, enter Chaonia\xc3\x95s harbour\rand approach the lofty city of Buthrotum. \r\rBKIII:294-355 ANDROMACHE IN CHAONIA\r\rHere a rumour of something unbelievable greeted our ears:\rPriam\xc3\x95s son, Helenus, reigning over Greek cities,\rhaving won the wife and kingdom of Pyrrhus, Aeacus\xc3\x95s scion, \rAndromache being given again to a husband of her race.\rI was astounded, and my heart burned with an amazing passion\rto speak to the man, and learn of such events.\rI walked from the harbour, leaving the fleet and the shore,\rwhen, by chance, in a sacred grove near the city, by a false Simois,\rAndromache was making an annual offering, sad gifts,\rto Hector\xc3\x95s ashes, and calling his spirit to the tomb,\ran empty mound of green turf, and twin altars, she had sanctified,\ra place for tears. When she saw me approaching and recognised,\rwith amazement, Trojan weapons round her, she froze as she gazed,\rterrified by these great wonders, and the heat left her limbs.\rShe half-fell and after a long while, scarcely able to, said:\r\xc3\x92Are you a real person, a real messenger come here to me,\rson of the goddess? Are you alive? Or if the kindly light has faded,\rwhere then is Hector?\xc3\x93 She spoke, and poured out her tears,\rand filled the whole place with her weeping. Given her frenzy,\rI barely replied with a few words, and, moved, I spoke disjointedly:\r\xc3\x92Surely, I live, and lead a life full of extremes: don\xc3\x95t be unsure,\rfor you see truly. Ah! What fate has overtaken you, fallen\rfrom so great a husband? Or has good fortune worthy enough\rfor Hector\xc3\x95s Andromache, visited you again? Are you still\rPyrrhus\xc3\x95s wife?\xc3\x93 She lowered her eyes and spoke quietly:\r \xc3\x92O happy beyond all others was that virgin daughter\rof Priam, commanded to die beside an enemy tomb, \runder Troy\xc3\x95s high walls, who never suffered fate\xc3\x95s lottery, \ror, as a prisoner, reached her victorious master\xc3\x95s bed!\rCarried over distant seas, my country set afire, I endured\rthe scorn of Achilles\xc3\x95s son, and his youthful arrogance,\rgiving birth as a slave: he, who then, pursuing Hermione,\rHelen\xc3\x95s daughter, and a Spartan marriage, transferred me\rto Helenus\xc3\x95s keeping, a servant to a servant. \rBut Orestes, inflamed by great love for his stolen bride, \rand driven by the Furies for his crime, caught him,\runawares, and killed him by his father\xc3\x95s altar.\rAt Pyrrhus\xc3\x95s death a part of the kingdom passed, by right\rto Helenus, who named the Chaonian fields, and all\rChaonia, after Chaon of Troy, and built a Pergamus,\rand this fortress of Ilium, on the mountain ridge. \rBut what winds, what fates, set your course for you?\rOr what god drives you, unknowingly, to our shores?\rWhat of the child, Ascanius? Does he live, and graze on air,\rhe whom Creusa bore to you in vanished Troy?\rHas he any love still for his lost mother? \rHave his father Aeneas and his uncle Hector roused\rin him any of their ancient courage or virile spirit?\xc3\x93\rWeeping, she poured out these words, and was starting\ra long vain lament, when heroic Helenus, Priam\xc3\x95s son,\rapproached from the city, with a large retinue,\rand recognised us as his own, and lead us, joyfully,\rto the gates, and poured out tears freely at every word.\rI walked on, and saw a little Troy, and a copy of the great\rcitadel, and a dry stream, named after the Xanthus,\rand embraced the doorposts of a Scaean Gate.\rMy Trojans enjoyed the friendly city with me no less.\rThe king received them in a broad colonnade:\rthey poured out cups of wine in the centre of a courtyard,\rand held out their dishes while food was served on gold.\r\rBKIII:356-462 THE PROPHECY OF HELENUS\r \rNow day after day has gone by, and the breezes call\rto the sails, and the canvas swells with a rising Southerly:\rI go to Helenus, the seer, with these words and ask:\r\xc3\x92Trojan-born, agent of the gods, you who know Apollo\xc3\x95s will,\rthe tripods, the laurels at Claros, the stars, the language\rof birds, and the omens of their wings in flight,\rcome, speak (since a favourable oracle told me \rall my route, and all the gods in their divinity urged me\rto seek Italy, and explore the furthest lands:\ronly the Harpy, Celaeno, predicts fresh portents, \revil to tell of, and threatens bitter anger\rand vile famine) first, what dangers shall I avoid?\rFollowing what course can I overcome such troubles?\xc3\x93\rHelenus, first sacrificing bullocks according to the ritual,\robtained the gods\xc3\x95 grace, then loosened the headband\rfrom his holy brow, and led me, anxious at so much\rdivine power, with his own hand, to your threshold Apollo,\rand then the priest prophesied this, from the divine mouth:\r\xc3\x92Son of the goddess, since the truth is clear, that you sail\rthe deep blessed by the higher powers (so the king of the gods\rallots our fates, and rolls the changes, so the order alters),\rI\xc3\x95ll explain a few things of many, in my words to you,\rso you may travel foreign seas more safely, and can find\rrest in an Italian haven: for the Fates forbid Helenus\rto know further, and Saturnian Juno denies him speech.\rFirstly, a long pathless path, by long coastlines, separates\ryou from that far-off Italy, whose neighbouring port \ryou intend to enter, unknowingly thinking it nearby. \rBefore you can build your city in a safe land,\ryou must bend the oar in Sicilian waters,\rand pass the levels of the Italian seas, in your ships,\rthe infernal lakes, and Aeaean Circe\xc3\x95s island.\rI\xc3\x95ll tell you of signs: keep them stored in your memory.\rWhen, in your distress, you find a huge sow lying on the shore,\rby the waters of a remote river, under the oak trees,\rthat has farrowed a litter of thirty young, a white sow,\rlying on the ground, with white piglets round her teats,\rthat place shall be your city, there\xc3\x95s true rest from your labours.\rAnd do not dread that gnawing of tables, in your future:\rthe fates will find a way, Apollo will be there at your call.\rBut avoid these lands, and this nearer coastline\rof the Italian shore, washed by our own\rocean tide: hostile Greeks inhabit every town.\rThe Narycian Locri have built a city here,\rand Lyctian Idomeneus has filled the plain \rwith soldiers: here is that little Petelia, of Philoctetes, \rleader of the Meliboeans, relying on its walls.\rThen when your fleet has crossed the sea, and anchored\rand the altars are raised for your offerings on the shore,\rveil your hair, clothed in your purple robes, so that\rin worshipping the gods no hostile face may intrude\ramong the sacred flames, and disturb the omens.\rLet your friends adopt this mode of sacrifice, and yourself:\rand let your descendants remain pure in this religion.\rBut when the wind carries you, on leaving, to the Sicilian shore,\rand the barriers of narrow Pelorus open ahead, \rmake for the seas and land to port, in a long circuit: \ravoid the shore and waters on the starboard side.\rThey say, when the two were one continuous stretch of land,\rthey one day broke apart, torn by the force of a vast upheaval\r(time\xc3\x95s remote antiquity enables such great changes).\rThe sea flowed between them with force, and severed\rthe Italian from the Sicilian coast, and a narrow tideway\rwashes the cities and fields on separate shores.\rScylla holds the right side, implacable Charybdis the left,\rwho, in the depths of the abyss, swallows the vast flood\rthree times into the downward gulf and alternately lifts\rit to the air, and lashes the heavens with her waves.\rBut a cave surrounds Scylla with dark hiding-places,\rand she thrusts her mouths out, and drags ships onto the rocks.\rAbove she has human shape, and is a girl, with lovely breasts,\ra girl, down to her sex, below it she is a sea-monster of huge size,\rwith dolphins\xc3\x95 tails joined to a belly formed of wolves. \rIt is better to round the point of Pachynus,\rlingering, and circling Sicily on a long course,\rthan to once catch sight of hideous Scylla in her vast cave\rand the rocks that echo to her sea-dark hounds.\rBeyond this, if Helenus has any knowledge, if the seer\rcan be believed, if Apollo fills his spirit with truth,\rson of the goddess, I will say this one thing, this one thing\rthat is worth all, and I\xc3\x95ll repeat the warning again and again,\rhonour great Juno\xc3\x95s divinity above all, with prayer, and recite \ryour vows to Juno freely, and win over that powerful lady\rwith humble gifts: so at last you\xc3\x95ll leave Sicily behind\rand reach the coast of Italy, victorious. \rOnce brought there, approach the city of Cumae,\rthe ghostly lakes, and Avernus, with its whispering groves,\rgaze on the raving prophetess, who sings the fates\rdeep in the rock, and commits names and signs to leaves.\rWhatever verses the virgin writes on the leaves,\rshe arranges in order, and stores them high up in her cave.\rThey stay in place, motionless, and keep in rank:\rbut once a light breeze ruffles them, at the turn of a hinge,\rand the opening door disturbs the delicate leaves, she never \rthinks to retrieve them, as they flutter through the rocky cave, \ror to return them to their places, or reconstitute the prophecies:\rmen go away unanswered, and detest the Sibyl\xc3\x95s lair.\rThough your friends complain, and though your course\rcalls your sails urgently to the deep, and a following wind\rmight fill the canvas, don\xc3\x95t overvalue the loss in any delay,\rbut visit the prophetess, and beg her with prayers to speak\rthe oracle herself, and loose her voice through willing lips.\rShe will rehearse the peoples of Italy, the wars to come,\rand how you might evade or endure each trial,\rand, shown respect, she\xc3\x95ll grant you a favourable journey.\rThese are the things you can be warned of by my voice.\rGo now, and by your actions raise great Troy to the stars.\xc3\x93\r\rBKIII:463-505 THE DEPARTURE FROM CHAONIA\r\rAfter the seer had spoken these words with benign lips,\rhe ordered heavy gifts of gold and carved ivory\rto be carried to our ships, and stored massive silverware\rin the holds, cauldrons from Dodona, a hooked breastplate\rwoven with triple-linked gold, and a fine conical helmet\rwith a crest of horse-hair, Pyrrhus\xc3\x95s armour. \rThere were gifts of his own for my father too.\rHelenus added horses and sea-pilots: he manned\rour oars: he also equipped my friends with weapons.\rMeanwhile Anchises ordered us to rig sails on the ships,\rso the rushing wind would not be lost, by our delay.\rApollo\xc3\x95s agent spoke to him with great respect:\r\xc3\x92Anchises, worthy of proud marriage with Venus,\rcared for by the gods, twice saved from the ruins of Troy,\rbehold your land of Italy: sail and take it.\rBut still you must slide past it on the seas:\rthe part of Italy that Apollo named is

Then my father Anchises\rtook up a large bowl, filled it with wine,\rand standing in the high stern, called to the heavens:\r\xc3\x92You gods, lords of the sea and earth and storms, carry us \ronward on a gentle breeze, and breathe on us with kindness!\xc3\x93\rThe wind we longed-for rises, now as we near, a harbour opens,\rand a temple is visible on Minerva\xc3\x95s Height.\rMy companions furl the sails and turn the prows to shore.\rThe harbour is carved in an arc by the eastern tides:\rits jutting rocks boil with salt spray, so that it itself is hidden:\rtowering cliffs extend their arms in a twin wall,\rand the temple lies back from the shore.\rHere I see four horses in the long grass, white as snow, \rgrazing widely over the plain, our first omen.\rAnd my father Anchises cries: \xc3\x92O foreign land, you bring us war:\rhorses are armed for war, war is what this herd threatens.\rYet those same creatures one day can be yoked to a chariot,\rand once yoked will suffer the bridle in harmony:\rthere\xc3\x95s also hope of peace.\xc3\x93 Then we pray to the sacred power\rof Pallas, of the clashing weapons, first to receive our cheers,\rand clothed in Phrygian robes we veiled our heads before the altar,\rand following the urgent command Helenus had given,\rwe duly made burnt offerings to Argive Juno as ordered. \r\rBKIII:548-587 THE APPROACH TO SICILY\r\rWithout delay, as soon as our vows are fully paid,\rwe haul on the ends of our canvas-shrouded yard-arms,\rand leave the home of the Greek race, and the fields we mistrust.\rThen Tarentum\xc3\x95s bay is seen, Hercules\xc3\x95s city if the tale is true:\rLacinian Juno\xc3\x95s temple rises against it, Caulon\xc3\x95s fortress,\rand Scylaceum\xc3\x95s shore of shipwreck.\rThen far off Sicilian Etna appears from the waves,\rand we hear the loud roar of the sea, and the distant\rtremor of the rocks, and the broken murmurs of the shore,\rthe shallows boil, and sand mixes with the flood.\rThen my father, Anchises, said: \xc3\x92This must be Charybdis:\rthese are the cliffs, these are the horrendous rocks Helenus foretold.\rPull away, O comrades, and stand to the oars together.\xc3\x93\rThey do no less than they\xc3\x95re asked, and Palinurus is the first\rto heave his groaning ship into the portside waves:\rall our company seek port with oars and sail.\rWe climb to heaven on the curving flood, and again\rsink down with the withdrawing waves to the depths of Hades.\rThe cliffs boom three times in their rocky caves,\rthree times we see the spray burst, and the dripping stars.\rThen the wind and sunlight desert weary men,\rand not knowing the way we drift to the Cyclopes\xc3\x95s shore.\rThere\xc3\x95s a harbour, itself large and untroubled by the passing winds,\rbut Etna rumbles nearby with fearsome avalanches,\rnow it spews black clouds into the sky, smoking,\rwith pitch-black turbulence, and glowing ashes,\rand throws up balls of flame, licking the stars:\rnow it hurls high the rocks it vomits, and the mountain\xc3\x95s \rtorn entrails, and gathers molten lava together in the air\rwith a roar, boiling from its lowest depths.\rThe tale is that Enceladus\xc3\x95s body, scorched by the lightning-bolt,\ris buried by that mass, and piled above him, mighty Etna\rbreathes flames from its riven furnaces,\rand as often as he turns his weary flank, all Sicily\rquakes and rumbles, and clouds the sky with smoke.\rThat night we hide in the woods, enduring the dreadful shocks,\runable to see what the cause of the sound is,\rsince there are no heavenly fires, no bright pole\rin the starry firmament, but clouds in a darkened sky,\rand the dead of night holds the moon in shroud.\r\rBKIII:588-654 ACHAEMENIDES\r\rNow the next day was breaking with the first light of dawn,\rand Aurora had dispersed the moist shadows from the sky,\rwhen suddenly the strange form of an unknown man came out\rof the woods, exhausted by the last pangs of hunger, \rpitifully dressed, and stretched his hands in supplication \rtowards the shore. We looked back.

I know I\xc3\x95m from one of the Greek ships,\rand I confess that I made war against Trojan gods,\rif my crime is so great an injury to you, scatter me\rover the waves for it, or drown me in the vast ocean:\rif I die I\xc3\x95ll delight in dying at the hands of men.\xc3\x93\rHe spoke and clung to my knees, embracing them \rand grovelling there. We urged him to say who he was,\rborn of what blood, then to say what fate pursued him.\rWithout much delay, my father Anchises himself gave\rthe young man his hand, lifting his spirits by this ready trust.\rAt last he set his fears aside and told us:\r\xc3\x92I\xc3\x95m from the land of Ithaca, a companion of unlucky Ulysses,\rAchaemenides by name, and, my father Adamastus being poor,\r(I wish fate had kept me so!) I set out for Troy.\rMy comrades left me here in the Cyclops\xc3\x95 vast cave,\rforgetting me, as they hurriedly left that grim\rthreshold. It\xc3\x95s a house of blood and gory feasts,\rvast and dark inside. He himself is gigantic, striking against\rthe high stars \xc3\x90 gods, remove plagues like that from the earth! \xc3\x90\rnot pleasant to look at, affable to no one.\rHe eats the dark blood and flesh of wretched men.\rI saw myself how he seized two of our number in his huge hands,\rand reclining in the centre of the cave, broke them\ron the rock, so the threshold, drenched, swam with blood:\rI saw how he gnawed their limbs, dripping with dark clots\rof gore, and the still-warm bodies quivered in his jaws.\rYet he did not go unpunished: Ulysses didn\xc3\x95t suffer it,\rnor did the Ithacan forget himself in a crisis. \rAs soon as the Cyclops, full of flesh and sated with wine,\rrelaxed his neck, and lay, huge in size, across the cave,\rdrooling gore and blood and wine-drenched fragments \rin his sleep, we prayed to the great gods, and our roles fixed,\rsurrounded him on all sides, and stabbed his one huge eye,\rsolitary, and half-hidden under his savage brow,\rlike a round Greek shield, or the sun-disc of Phoebus,\rwith a sharpened stake: and so we joyfully avenged\rthe spirits of our friends. But fly from here, wretched men,\rand cut your mooring ropes. Since, like Polyphemus, who pens\rwoolly flocks in the rocky cave, and milks their udders, there are\ra hundred other appalling Cyclopes, the same in shape and size,\reverywhere inhabiting the curved bay, and wandering the hills.\rThe moon\xc3\x95s horns have filled with light three times now, while I\rhave been dragging my life out in the woods, among the lairs \rand secret haunts of wild creatures, watching the huge Cyclopes\rfrom the cliffs, trembling at their voices and the sound of their feet. \rThe branches yield a miserable supply of fruits and stony cornelian\rcherries, and the grasses, torn up by their roots, feed me.\rWatching for everything, I saw, for the first time, this fleet \rapproaching shore. Whatever might happen, I surrendered myself\rto you: it\xc3\x95s enough for me to have escaped that wicked people.\rI\xc3\x95d rather you took this life of mine by any death whatsoever.\xc3\x93\r\rBKIII:655-691 POLYPHEMUS\r\rHe\xc3\x95d barely spoken, when we saw the shepherd Polyphemus\rhimself, moving his mountainous bulk on the hillside\ramong the flocks, and heading for the familiar shore,\ra fearful monster, vast and shapeless, robbed of the light.\rA lopped pine-trunk in his hand steadied and guided\rhis steps: his fleecy sheep accompanied him: \rhis sole delight and the solace for his evils. \rAs soon as he came to the sea and reached the deep water,\rhe washed away the blood oozing from the gouged eye-socket,\rgroaning and gnashing his teeth. Then he walked through\rthe depths of the waves, without the tide wetting his vast thighs.\rAnxiously we hurried our departure from there, accepting \rthe worthy suppliant on board, and cutting the cable in silence:\rthen leaning into our oars, we vied in sweeping the sea.\rHe heard, and bent his course towards the sound of splashing.\rBut when he was denied the power to set hands on us,\rand unable to counter the force of the Ionian waves, in pursuit,\rhe raised a mighty shout, at which the sea and all the waves\rshook, and the land of Italy was frightened far inland,\rand Etna bellowed from its winding caverns, but the tribe\rof Cyclopes, roused from their woods and high mountains, \rrushed to the harbour, and crowded the shore.\rWe saw them standing there, impotently, wild-eyed,\rthe Aetnean brotherhood, heads towering into the sky,\ra fearsome gathering: like tall oaks rooted on a summit,\ror cone-bearing cypresses, in Jove\xc3\x95s high wood or Diana\xc3\x95s grove.\rAcute fear drove us on to pay out the ropes on whatever tack\rand spread our sails to any favourable wind. \rHelenus\xc3\x95s orders warned against taking a course between\rScylla and Charybdis, a hair\xc3\x95s breadth from death\ron either side: we decided to beat back again.\rWhen, behold, a northerly arrived from the narrow\rheadland of Pelorus: I sailed past the natural rock mouth\rof the Pantagias, Megara\xc3\x95s bay, and low-lying Thapsus.\rSuch were the shores Achaemenides, the friend of unlucky Ulysses,\rshowed me, sailing his wandering journey again, in reverse.\r\r\r\rBKIII:692-718 THE DEATH OF ANCHISES\r \rAn island lies over against wave-washed Plemyrium,\rstretched across a Sicilian bay: named Ortygia by men of old.\rThe story goes that Alpheus, a river of Elis, forced\ra hidden path here under the sea, and merges \rwith the Sicilian waters of your fountain Arethusa.\rAs commanded we worshipped the great gods of this land,\rand from there I passed marshy Helorus\xc3\x95s marvellously rich soil.\rNext we passed the tall reefs and jutting rocks of Pachynus,\rand Camerina appeared in the distance, granted\rimmoveable, by prophecy, and the Geloan plains, \rand Gela named after its savage river.\rThen steep Acragas, once the breeder of brave horses,\rshowed its mighty ramparts in the distance:\rand granted the wind, I left palmy Selinus, and passed\rthe tricky shallows of Lilybaeum with their blind reefs.\rNext the harbour of Drepanum, and its joyless shore,\rreceived me. Here, alas, I lost my father, Anchises, \rmy comfort in every trouble and misfortune, I, who\xc3\x95d\rbeen driven by so many ocean storms: here you left me, \rweary, best of fathers, saved from so many dangers in vain!\rHelenus, the seer, did not prophesy this grief of mine,\rwhen he warned me of many horrors, nor did grim Celaeno.\rThis was my last trouble, this the end of my long journey:\rleaving there, the god drove me to your shores.\xc3\x95\rSo our ancestor Aeneas, as all listened to one man,\rrecounted divine fate, and described his journey.\rAt last he stopped, and making an end here, rested.\r\r\r\n\r\n\r\rBOOK IV\r\r\rBKIV:1-53 DIDO AND ANNA DISCUSS AENEAS\r\rBut the queen, wounded long since by intense love, \rfeeds the hurt with her life-blood, weakened by hidden fire.\rThe hero\xc3\x95s courage often returns to mind, and the nobility\rof his race: his features and his words cling fixedly to her heart,\rand love will not grant restful calm to her body.\rThe new day\xc3\x95s Dawn was lighting the earth with Phoebus\xc3\x95s\rbrightness, and dispelling the dew-wet shadows from the sky,\rwhen she spoke ecstatically to her sister, her kindred spirit:\r\xc3\x92Anna, sister, how my dreams terrify me with anxieties!\rWho is this strange guest who has entered our house,\rwith what boldness he speaks, how resolute in mind and warfare!\rTruly I think \xc3\x90 and it\xc3\x95s no idle saying \xc3\x90 that he\xc3\x95s born of a goddess.\rFear reveals the ignoble spirit.

Now in his flight he saw the steep flanks\rand the summit of strong Atlas, who holds the heavens\ron his head, Atlas, whose pine-covered crown is always wreathed\rin dark clouds and lashed by the wind and rain:\rfallen snow clothes his shoulders: while rivers fall\rfrom his ancient chin, and his rough beard bristles with ice.\rThere Cyllenian Mercury first halted, balanced on level wings:\rfrom there, he threw his whole body headlong \rtowards the waves, like a bird that flies low close \rto the sea, round the coasts and the rocks rich in fish.\rSo the Cyllenian-born flew between heaven and earth\rto Libya\xc3\x95s sandy shore, cutting the winds, coming\rfrom Atlas, his mother Maia\xc3\x95s father.\rAs soon as he reached the builders\xc3\x95 huts, on his winged feet,\rhe saw Aeneas establishing towers and altering roofs.\rHis sword was starred with tawny jasper, \rand the cloak that hung from his shoulder blazed\rwith Tyrian purple, a gift that rich Dido had made,\rweaving the cloth with golden thread.\rMercury challenged him at once: \xc3\x92For love of a wife \rare you now building the foundations of high Carthage\rand a pleasing city? Alas, forgetful of your kingdom and fate!\rThe king of the gods himself, who bends heaven and earth\rto his will, has sent me down to you from bright Olympus:\rhe commanded me himself to carry these words through\rthe swift breezes. What do you plan? With what hopes\rdo you waste idle hours in Libya\xc3\x95s lands? If you\xc3\x95re not stirred\rby the glory of destiny, and won\xc3\x95t exert yourself for your own\rfame, think of your growing Ascanius, and the expectations\rof him, as Iulus your heir, to whom will be owed the kingdom \rof Italy, and the Roman lands.\xc3\x93 So Mercury spoke,\rand, while speaking, vanished from mortal eyes,\rand melted into thin air far from their sight.\r\rBKIV:279-330 DIDO ACCUSES AENEAS\r\rAeneas, stupefied at the vision, was struck dumb,\rand his hair rose in terror, and his voice stuck in his throat.\rHe was eager to be gone, in flight, and leave that sweet land,\rshocked by the warning and the divine command.\rAlas! What to do? With what speech dare he tackle \rthe love-sick queen? What opening words should he choose?\rAnd he cast his mind back and forth swiftly, \rconsidered the issue from every aspect, and turned it every way.\rThis seemed the best decision, given the alternatives:\rhe called Mnestheus, Sergestus and brave Serestus,\rtelling them to fit out the fleet in silence, gather the men\ron the shore, ready the ships\xc3\x95 tackle, and hide the reason\rfor these changes of plan. He in the meantime, since \rthe excellent Dido knew nothing, and would not expect\rthe breaking off of such a love, would seek an approach,\rthe tenderest moment to speak, and a favourable means.\rThey all gladly obeyed his command at once, and did his bidding.\rBut the queen sensed his tricks (who can deceive a lover?)\rand was first to anticipate future events, fearful even of safety.\rThat same impious Rumour brought her madness:\rthey are fitting out the fleet, and planning a journey.\rHer mind weakened, she raves, and, on fire, runs wild\rthrough the city: like a Maenad, thrilled by the shaken emblems\rof the god, when the biennial festival rouses her, and, hearing the Bacchic cry,\rMount Cithaeron summons her by night with its noise.\r\r\rDido Excoriates Aeneas\rJean-Michel Moreau le jeune (France, 1741-1814)\rGetty Open Content Program\r\r\n\rOf her own accord she finally reproaches Aeneas in these words:\r\xc3\x92Faithless one, did you really think you could hide\rsuch wickedness, and vanish from my land in silence?\rWill my love not hold you, nor the pledge I once gave you,\rnor the promise that Dido will die a cruel death? \rEven in winter do you labour over your ships, cruel one,\rso as to sail the high seas at the height of the northern gales?\rWhy? If you were not seeking foreign lands and unknown\rsettlements, but ancient Troy still stood, would Troy\rbe sought out by your ships in wave-torn seas? \rIs it me you run from? I beg you, by these tears, by your own\rright hand (since I\xc3\x95ve left myself no other recourse in my misery),\rby our union, by the marriage we have begun,\rif ever I deserved well of you, or anything of me \rwas sweet to you, pity this ruined house, and if \rthere is any room left for prayer, change your mind. \rThe Libyan peoples and Numidian rulers hate me because of you:\rmy Tyrians are hostile: because of you all shame too is lost,\rthe reputation I had, by which alone I might reach the stars.\rMy guest, since that\xc3\x95s all that is left me from the name of husband,\rto whom do you relinquish me, a dying woman?\rWhy do I stay? Until Pygmalion, my brother, destroys\rthe city, or Iarbas the Gaetulian takes me captive?\rIf I\xc3\x95d at least conceived a child of yours\rbefore you fled, if a little Aeneas were playing \rabout my halls, whose face might still recall yours, \rI\xc3\x95d not feel myself so utterly deceived and forsaken.\xc3\x93\r\rBKIV:331-361 AENEAS JUSTIFIES HIMSELF\r\rShe had spoken. He set his gaze firmly on Jupiter\xc3\x95s\rwarnings, and hid his pain steadfastly in his heart.\rHe replied briefly at last: \xc3\x92O queen, I will never deny\rthat you deserve the most that can be spelt out in speech,\rnor will I regret my thoughts of you, Elissa,\rwhile memory itself is mine, and breath controls these limbs.\rI\xc3\x95ll speak about the reality a little. I did not expect to conceal\rmy departure by stealth (don\xc3\x95t think that), nor have I ever\rheld the marriage torch, or entered into that pact. \rIf the fates had allowed me to live my life under my own\rauspices, and attend to my own concerns as I wished,\rI should first have cared for the city of Troy and the sweet relics\rof my family, Priam\xc3\x95s high roofs would remain, and I\xc3\x95d have \rrecreated Pergama, with my own hands, for the defeated. \rBut now it is Italy that Apollo of Grynium, \rItaly, that the Lycian oracles, order me to take:\rthat is my desire, that is my country. If the turrets of Carthage\rand the sight of your Libyan city occupy you, a Phoenician,\rwhy then begrudge the Trojans their settling of Ausonia\xc3\x95s lands?\rIt is right for us too to search out a foreign kingdom.\rAs often as night cloaks the earth with dew-wet shadows,\ras often as the burning constellations rise, the troubled image\rof my father Anchises warns and terrifies me in dream:\rabout my son Ascanius and the wrong to so dear a person,\rwhom I cheat of a Hesperian kingdom, and pre-destined fields.\rNow even the messenger of the gods, sent by Jupiter himself,\r(I swear it on both our heads), has brought the command\ron the swift breeze: I saw the god himself in broad daylight\renter the city and these very ears drank of his words.\rStop rousing yourself and me with your complaints.\rI do not take course for Italy of my own free will.\xc3\x93\r\rBKIV:362-392 DIDO\xc3\x95S REPLY\r\rAs he was speaking she gazed at him with hostility,\rcasting her eyes here and there, considering the whole man\rwith a silent stare, and then, incensed, she spoke:\r\xc3\x92Deceiver, your mother was no goddess, nor was Dardanus\rthe father of your race: harsh Caucasus engendered you\ron the rough crags, and Hyrcanian tigers nursed you.\rWhy pretend now, or restrain myself waiting for something worse?\rDid he groan at my weeping? Did he look at me?\rDid he shed tears in defeat, or pity his lover?\rWhat is there to say after this? Now neither greatest Juno, indeed,\rnor Jupiter, son of Saturn, are gazing at this with friendly eyes.\rNowhere is truth safe. I welcomed him as a castaway on the shore,\ra beggar, and foolishly gave away a part of my kingdom:\rI saved his lost fleet, and his friends from death.\rAh! Driven by the Furies, I burn: now prophetic Apollo,\rnow the Lycian oracles, now even a divine messenger sent\rby Jove himself carries his orders through the air.\rThis is the work of the gods indeed, this is a concern to trouble\rtheir calm. I do not hold you back, or refute your words:\rgo, seek Italy on the winds, find your kingdom over the waves.\rYet if the virtuous gods have power, I hope that you\rwill drain the cup of suffering among the reefs, and call out Dido\xc3\x95s\rname again and again. Absent, I\xc3\x95ll follow you with dark fires, \rand when icy death has divided my soul and body, my ghost\rwill be present everywhere. Cruel one, you\xc3\x95ll be punished.\rI\xc3\x95ll hear of it: that news will reach me in the depths of Hades.\xc3\x93\rSaying this, she broke off her speech mid-flight, and fled\rthe light in pain, turning from his eyes, and going,\rleaving him fearful and hesitant, ready to say more.\rHer servants received her and carried her failing body \rto her marble chamber, and laid her on her bed.\r\rBKIV:393-449 AENEAS DEPARTS\r\rBut dutiful Aeneas, though he desired to ease her sadness\rby comforting her and to turn aside pain with words, still, \rwith much sighing, and a heart shaken by the strength of her love,\rfollowed the divine command, and returned to the fleet.\rThen the Trojans truly set to work and launched the tall ships\rall along the shore. They floated the resinous keels,\rand ready for flight, they brought leafy branches\rand untrimmed trunks, from the woods, as oars.\rYou could see them hurrying and moving from every part\rof the city. Like ants that plunder a vast heap of grain,\rand store it in their nest, mindful of winter: a dark column\rgoes through the fields, and they carry their spoils\ralong a narrow track through the grass: some heave\rwith their shoulders against a large seed, and push, others tighten\rthe ranks and punish delay, the whole path\xc3\x95s alive with work.\rWhat were your feelings Dido at such sights, what sighs\rdid you give, watching the shore from the heights \rof the citadel, everywhere alive, and seeing the whole \rsea, before your eyes, confused with such cries!\rCruel Love, to what do you not drive the human heart:\rto burst into tears once more, to see once more if he can\rbe compelled by prayers, to humbly submit to love,\rlest she leave anything untried, dying in vain.\r\xc3\x92Anna, you see them scurrying all round the shore:\rthey\xc3\x95ve come from everywhere: the canvas already invites\rthe breeze, and the sailors, delighted, have set garlands\ron the sterns. If I was able to foresee this great grief,\rsister, then I\xc3\x95ll be able to endure it too. Yet still do one thing\rfor me in my misery, Anna: since the deceiver cultivated\ronly you, even trusting you with his private thoughts:\rand only you know the time to approach the man easily.\rGo, sister, and speak humbly to my proud enemy.\rI never took the oath, with the Greeks at Aulis,\rto destroy the Trojan race, or sent a fleet to Pergama,\ror disturbed the ashes and ghost of his father Anchises:\rwhy does he pitilessly deny my words access to his hearing?\rWhere does he run to? Let him give his poor lover this last gift:\rlet him wait for an easy voyage and favourable winds.\rI don\xc3\x95t beg now for our former tie, that he has betrayed,\rnor that he give up his beautiful Latium, and abandon\rhis kingdom: I ask for insubstantial time: peace and space\rfor my passion, while fate teaches my beaten spirit to grieve.\rI beg for this last favour (pity your sister):\rwhen he has granted it me, I\xc3\x95ll repay all by dying.\xc3\x93\rSuch are the prayers she made, and such are those\rher unhappy sister carried and re-carried. But he was not\rmoved by tears, and listened to no words receptively:\rFate barred the way, and a god sealed the hero\xc3\x95s gentle hearing.\rAs when northerly blasts from the Alps blowing here and there\rvie together to uproot an oak tree, tough with the strength of years:\rthere\xc3\x95s a creak, and the trunk quivers and the topmost leaves\rstrew the ground: but it clings to the rocks, and its roots\rstretch as far down to Tartarus as its crown does towards\rthe heavens: so the hero was buffeted by endless pleas \rfrom this side and that, and felt the pain in his noble heart. \rHis purpose remained fixed: tears fell uselessly.\r\rBKIV:450-503 DIDO RESOLVES TO DIE\r\rThen the unhappy Dido, truly appalled by her fate, \rprayed for death: she was weary of gazing at the vault of heaven.\rAnd that she might complete her purpose, and relinquish the light\rmore readily, when she placed her offerings on the altar alight\rwith incense, she saw (terrible to speak of!) the holy water blacken,\rand the wine she had poured change to vile blood.\rShe spoke of this vision to no one, not even her sister.\rThere was a marble shrine to her former husband in the palace,\rthat she\xc3\x95d decked out, also, with marvellous beauty,\rwith snow-white fleeces, and festive greenery:\rfrom it she seemed to hear voices and her husband\xc3\x95s words\rcalling her, when dark night gripped the earth:\rand the lonely owl on the roofs often grieved\rwith ill-omened cries, drawing out its long call in a lament:\rand many a prophecy of the ancient seers terrified her\rwith its dreadful warning. Harsh Aeneas himself persecuted\rher, in her crazed sleep: always she was forsaken, alone with\rherself, always she seemed to be travelling companionless on some\rlong journey, seeking her Tyrian people in a deserted landscape:\rlike Pentheus, deranged, seeing the Furies file past,\rand twin suns and a twin Thebes revealed to view,\ror like Agamemnon\xc3\x95s son Orestes driven across the stage when he\rflees his mother\xc3\x95s ghost armed with firebrands and black snakes,\rwhile the avenging Furies crouch on the threshold.\rSo that when, overcome by anguish, she harboured the madness,\rand determined on death, she debated with herself over the time\rand the method, and going to her sorrowful sister with a face \rthat concealed her intent, calm, with hope on her brow, said:\r\xc3\x92Sister, I\xc3\x95ve found a way (rejoice with your sister)\rthat will return him to me, or free me from loving him.\rNear the ends of the Ocean and where the sun sets\rEthiopia lies, the furthest of lands, where Atlas, \rmightiest of all, turns the sky set with shining stars:\rI\xc3\x95ve been told of a priestess, of Massylian race, there, \ra keeper of the temple of the Hesperides, who gave\rthe dragon its food, and guarded the holy branches of the tree,\rscattering the honeydew and sleep-inducing poppies.\rWith her incantations she promises to set free \rwhat hearts she wishes, but bring cruel pain to others:\rto stop the rivers flowing, and turn back the stars:\rshe wakes nocturnal Spirits: you\xc3\x95ll see earth yawn\runder your feet, and the ash trees march from the hills.\rYou, and the gods, and your sweet life, are witness,\rdear sister, that I arm myself with magic arts unwillingly.\rBuild a pyre, secretly, in an inner courtyard, open to the sky, \rand place the weapons on it which that impious man left \rhanging in my room, and the clothes, and the bridal bed \rthat undid me: I want to destroy all memories\rof that wicked man, and the priestess commends it.\xc3\x93\rSaying this she fell silent: at the same time a pallor spread\rover her face. Anna did not yet realise that her sister \rwas disguising her own funeral with these strange rites,\rher mind could not conceive of such intensity, \rand she feared nothing more serious than when \rSychaeus died. So she prepared what was demanded.\r\rBKIV:504-553 DIDO LAMENTS\r\rBut when the pyre of cut pine and oak was raised high, \rin an innermost court open to the sky, the queen\rhung the place with garlands, and wreathed it \rwith funereal foliage: she laid his sword and clothes\rand picture on the bed, not unmindful of the ending.\rAltars stand round about, and the priestess, with loosened hair,\rintoned the names of three hundred gods, of Erebus, Chaos,\rand the triple Hecate, the three faces of virgin Diana.\rAnd she sprinkled water signifying the founts of Avernus:\rthere were herbs too acquired by moonlight, cut\rwith a bronze sickle, moist with the milk of dark venom:\rand a caul acquired by tearing it from a newborn colt\xc3\x95s brow,\rforestalling the mother\xc3\x95s love. She herself, near the altars,\rwith sacred grain in purified hands, one foot free of constraint,\rher clothing loosened, called on the gods to witness\rher coming death, and on the stars conscious of fate: \rthen she prayed to whatever just and attentive power \rthere might be, that cares for unrequited lovers.\rIt was night, and everywhere weary creatures were enjoying\rpeaceful sleep, the woods and the savage waves were resting, \rwhile stars wheeled midway in their gliding orbit,\rwhile all the fields were still, and beasts and colourful birds,\rthose that live on wide scattered lakes, and those that live\rin rough country among the thorn-bushes, were sunk in sleep\rin the silent night. But not the Phoenician, unhappy in spirit, \rshe did not relax in sleep, or receive the darkness into her eyes\rand breast: her cares redoubled, and passion, alive once more, \rraged, and she swelled with  a great tide of anger.\rSo she began in this way turning it over alone in her heart:\r\xc3\x92See, what can I do? Be mocked trying my former suitors,\rseeking marriage humbly with Numidians whom I \rhave already disdained so many times as husbands?\rShall I follow the Trojan fleet then and that Teucrian\xc3\x95s\revery whim? Because they might delight in having been\rhelped by my previous aid, or because gratitude \rfor past deeds might remain truly fixed in their memories?\rIndeed who, given I wanted to, would let me, or would take\rone they hate on board their proud ships? Ah, lost girl,\rdo you not know or feel yet the treachery of Laomedon\xc3\x95s race?\rWhat then? Shall I go alone, accompanying triumphant sailors?\rOr with all my band of Tyrians clustered round me?\rShall I again drive my men to sea in pursuit, those\rwhom I could barely tear away from their Sidonian city,\rand order them to spread their sails to the wind? \rRather die, as you deserve, and turn away sorrow with steel.\rYou, my sister, conquered by my tears, in my madness, you \rfirst burdened me with these ills, and exposed me to my enemy.\rI was not allowed to pass my life without blame, free of marriage, \rin the manner of some wild creature, never knowing such pain:\rI have not kept the vow I made to Sychaeus\xc3\x95s ashes.\xc3\x93\rSuch was the lament that burst from her heart.\r\rBKIV:554-583 MERCURY VISITS AENEAS AGAIN\r\rNow that everything was ready, and he was resolved on going,\rAeneas was snatching some sleep, on the ship\xc3\x95s high stern.\rThat vision appeared again in dream admonishing him,\rsimilar to Mercury in every way, voice and colouring,\rgolden hair, and youth\xc3\x95s graceful limbs:\r\xc3\x92Son of the Goddess, can you consider sleep in this disaster,\rcan\xc3\x95t you see the danger of it that surrounds you, madman\ror hear the favourable west winds blowing?\rDetermined to die, she broods on mortal deceit and sin,\rand is tossed about on anger\xc3\x95s volatile flood.\rWon\xc3\x95t you flee from here, in haste, while you can hasten?\rSoon you\xc3\x95ll see the water crowded with ships, \rcruel firebrands burning, soon the shore will rage with flame,\rif the Dawn finds you lingering in these lands. Come, now,\rend your delay! Woman is ever fickle and changeable.\xc3\x93 \rSo he spoke, and blended with night\xc3\x95s darkness. \rThen Aeneas, terrified indeed by the sudden apparition,\rroused his body from sleep, and called to his friends:\r\xc3\x92Quick, men, awake, and man the rowing-benches: run \rand loosen the sails. Know that a god, sent from the heavens,\rurges us again to speed our flight, and cut the twisted hawsers. \rWe follow you, whoever you may be, sacred among the gods,\rand gladly obey your commands once more. Oh, be with us, \rcalm one, help us, and show stars favourable to us in the sky.\xc3\x93 \rHe spoke, and snatched his shining sword from its sheath,\rand struck the cable with the naked blade.

Shall my Tyrians\rready their armour, and follow them out of the city, and others drag\rour ships from their docks?  Go, bring fire quickly, hand out the\rweapons, drive the oars! What am I saying? Where am I?\rWhat madness twists my thoughts? Wretched Dido, is it now\rthat your impious actions hurt you? The right time was then, \rwhen you gave him the crown. So this is the word and loyalty\rof the man whom they say bears his father\xc3\x95s gods around,\rof the man who carried his age-worn father on his shoulders? \rCouldn\xc3\x95t I have seized hold of him, torn his body apart,\rand scattered him on the waves? And put his friends to the sword,\rand Ascanius even, to feast on, as a course at his father\xc3\x95s table?\rTrue the fortunes of war are uncertain. Let them be so:\ras one about to die, whom had I to fear? I should have set fire\rto his camp, filled the decks with flames, and extinguishing\rfather and son, and their whole race, given up my own life as well.\rO Sun, you who illuminate all the works of this world,\rand you Juno, interpreter and knower of all my pain,\rand Hecate howled to, in cities, at midnight crossroads,\ryou, avenging Furies, and you, gods of dying Elissa,\racknowledge this, direct your righteous will to my troubles,\rand hear my prayer. If it must be that the accursed one\rshould reach the harbour, and sail to the shore: \rif Jove\xc3\x95s destiny for him requires it, there his goal:\rstill, troubled in war by the armies of a proud race, \rexiled from his territories, torn from Iulus\xc3\x95s embrace,\rlet him beg help, and watch the shameful death of his people: \rthen, when he has surrendered, to a peace without justice, \rmay he not enjoy his kingdom or the days he longed for,\rbut let him die before his time, and lie unburied on the sand.\rThis I pray, these last words I pour out with my blood.\rThen, O Tyrians, pursue my hatred against his whole line\rand the race to come, and offer it as a tribute to my ashes. \rLet there be no love or treaties between our peoples.\rRise, some unknown avenger, from my dust, who will pursue\rthe Trojan colonists with fire and sword, now, or in time\rto come, whenever the strength is granted him.\rI pray that shore be opposed to shore, water to wave,\rweapon to weapon: let them fight, them and their descendants.\xc3\x93\r\rBKIV:630-705 THE DEATH OF DIDO\r\rShe spoke, and turned her thoughts this way and that,\rconsidering how to destroy her hateful life.\rThen she spoke briefly to Barce, Sychaeus\xc3\x95s nurse,\rsince dark ashes concealed her own, in her former country:\r\xc3\x92Dear nurse, bring my sister Anna here: tell her\rto hurry, and sprinkle herself with water from the river,\rand bring the sacrificial victims and noble offerings.\rLet her come, and you yourself veil your brow with sacred ribbons.\rMy purpose is to complete the rites of Stygian Jupiter,\rthat I commanded, and have duly begun, and put an end\rto sorrow, and entrust the pyre of that Trojan leader to the flames.\xc3\x93\rSo she said. The old woman zealously hastened her steps.\rBut Dido restless, wild with desperate purpose,\rrolling her bloodshot eyes, her trembling cheeks\rstained with red flushes, yet pallid at approaching death,\rrushed into the house through its inner threshold, furiously \rclimbed the tall funeral pyre, and unsheathed \ra Trojan sword, a gift that was never acquired to this end.\rThen as she saw the Ilian clothing and the familiar couch,\rshe lingered a while, in tears and thought, then \rcast herself on the bed, and spoke her last words:\r\xc3\x92Reminders, sweet while fate and the god allowed it,\raccept this soul, and loose me from my sorrows.\rI have lived, and I have completed the course that Fortune granted,\rand now my noble spirit will pass beneath the earth.\rI have built a bright city: I have seen its battlements,\ravenging a husband I have exacted punishment\ron a hostile brother, happy, ah, happy indeed \rif Trojan keels had never touched my shores!\xc3\x93\rShe spoke, and buried her face in the couch. \r\xc3\x92I shall die un-avenged, but let me die,\xc3\x93 she cried.\r\xc3\x92So, so I joy in travelling into the shadows.\rLet the cruel Trojan\xc3\x95s eyes drink in this fire, on the deep,\rand bear with him the evil omen of my death.\xc3\x93\rShe had spoken, and in the midst of these words, \rher servants saw she had fallen on the blade, \rthe sword frothed with blood, and her hands were stained.\rA cry rose to the high ceiling: Rumour, run riot, struck the city.\rThe houses sounded with weeping and sighs and women\xc3\x95s cries,\rthe sky echoed with a mighty lamentation,\ras if all Carthage or ancient Tyre were falling \rto the invading enemy, and raging flames were rolling\rover the roofs of men and gods.\rHer sister, terrified, heard it, and rushed through the crowd,\rtearing her cheeks with her nails, and beating her breast,\rand called out to the dying woman in accusation:\r\xc3\x92So this was the meaning of it, sister? Did you aim to cheat me?\rThis pyre of yours, this fire and altar were prepared for my sake?\rWhat shall I grieve for first in my abandonment? Did you scorn\ryour sister\xc3\x95s company in dying? You should have summoned me\rto the same fate: the same hour the same sword\xc3\x95s hurt should have\rtaken us both. I even built your pyre with these hands, \rand was I calling aloud on our father\xc3\x95s gods, \rso that I would be absent, cruel one, as you lay here?\rYou have extinguished yourself and me, sister: your people,\ryour Sidonian ancestors, and your city. I should bathe\ryour wounds with water and catch with my lips \rwhatever dying breath still hovers.\xc3\x93 So saying she climbed\rthe high levels, and clasped her dying sister to her breast,\rsighing, and stemming the dark blood with her dress.\rDido tried to lift her heavy eyelids again, but failed:\rand the deep wound hissed in her breast.\rLifting herself three times, she struggled to rise on her elbow: \rthree times she fell back onto the bed, searching for light in \rthe depths of heaven, with wandering eyes, and, finding it, sighed.\rThen all-powerful Juno, pitying the long suffering \rof her difficult death, sent Iris from Olympus, to release \rthe struggling spirit, and captive body. For since\rshe had not died through fate, or by a well-earned death, \rbut wretchedly, before her time, inflamed with sudden madness, \rProserpine had not yet taken a lock of golden hair \rfrom her head, or condemned her soul to Stygian Orcus. \rSo dew-wet Iris flew down through the sky, on saffron wings,\rtrailing a thousand shifting colours across the sun,\rand hovered over her head. \xc3\x92I take this offering, sacred to Dis,\ras commanded, and release you from the body that was yours.\xc3\x93\rSo she spoke, and cut the lock of hair with her right hand.\rAll the warmth ebbed at once, and life vanished on the breeze.\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe Suicide of Dido, Giovanni Cesare Testa (Italy 1630-1655)\rYale University Art Gallery\r\r\n\r\n\r\rBOOK V\r\r\rBKV:1-41 AENEAS RETURNS TO SICILY\r\rMeanwhile Aeneas with the fleet was holding a fixed course\rnow in the midst of the sea, cutting the waves, dark in a northerly\rwind, looking back at the city walls that were glowing now with\runhappy Dido\xc3\x95s funeral flames. The reason that such a fire had\rbeen lit was unknown: but the cruel pain when a great love is\rprofaned, and the knowledge of what a frenzied woman might do,\rdrove the minds of the Trojans to sombre forebodings.\rWhen the ships reached deep water and land was no longer\rin sight, but everywhere was sea, and sky was everywhere,\rthen a dark-blue rain cloud hung overhead, bringing\rnight and storm, and the waves bristled with shadows.\rPalinurus the helmsman himself from the high stern cried:\r\xc3\x94Ah! Why have such storm clouds shrouded the sky?\rWhat do you intend, father Neptune?\xc3\x95 So saying, next\rhe ordered them to shorten sail, and bend to the heavy oars,\rthen tacked against the wind, and spoke as follows:\r\xc3\x94Brave Aeneas, I would not expect to make Italy\rwith this sky, though guardian Jupiter promised it.\rThe winds, rising from the darkened west, have shifted \rand roar across our path, and the air thickens for a storm.\rWe cannot stand against it, or labour enough to weather it.\rSince Fortune overcomes us, let\xc3\x95s go with her, \rand set our course wherever she calls. I think your brother Eryx\xc3\x95s\rfriendly shores are not far off, and the harbours of Sicily,\rif I only remember the stars I observed rightly.\xc3\x95\rThen virtuous Aeneas replied: \xc3\x94For my part I\xc3\x95ve seen for some time\rthat the winds required it, and you\xc3\x95re steering into them in vain.\rAlter the course we sail. Is any land more welcome to me,\rany to which I\xc3\x95d prefer to steer my weary fleet,\rthan that which protects my Trojan friend Acestes,\rand holds the bones of my father Anchises to its breast?\xc3\x93\rHaving said this they searched out the port, and following winds\rfilled their sails: the ships sailed swiftly on the flood,\rand they turned at last in delight towards known shores.\rBut Alcestes, on a high hill in the distance, wondered at the arrival\rof friendly vessels, and met them, armed with javelins,\rin his Libyan she-bear\xc3\x95s pelt: he whom a Trojan\rmother bore, conceived of the river-god Crinisius. \rNot neglectful of his ancient lineage he rejoiced\rat their return, entertained them gladly with his rural riches,\rand comforted the weary with the assistance of a friend.\r\rBKV:42-103 AENEAS DECLARES THE GAMES\r\rWhen, in the following Dawn, bright day had put the stars\rto flight, Aeneas called his companions together, \rfrom the whole shore, and spoke from a high mound:\r\xc3\x92Noble Trojans, people of the high lineage of the gods,\rthe year\xc3\x95s cycle is complete to the very month \rwhen we laid the bones, all that was left of my divine father, \rin the earth, and dedicated the sad altars. And now\rthe day is here (that the gods willed) if I am not wrong, \rwhich I will always hold as bitter, always honoured.\rIf I were keeping it, exiled in Gaetulian Syrtes,\ror caught on the Argive seas, or in Mycenae\xc3\x95s city,\rI\xc3\x95d still conduct the yearly rite, and line of solemn\rprocession, and heap up the due offerings on the altar.\rNow we even stand by the ashes and bones of my father\r(not for my part I think without the will and power of the gods)\rand carried to this place we have entered a friendly harbour.\rSo come and let us all celebrate the sacrifice with joy:\rlet us pray for a wind, and may he will me to offer these rites \reach year when my city is founded, in temples that are his.\rAcestes, a Trojan born, gives you two head of oxen \rfor every ship: Invite the household gods to our feast, \rour own and those whom Acestes our host worships.\rAlso, when the ninth Dawn raises high the kindly light\rfor mortal men, and reveals the world in her rays,\rI will declare a Trojan Games: first a race between the swift ships:\rthen those with ability in running, and those, daring in strength,\rwho step forward, who are superior with javelin and slight arrows,\ror trust themselves to fight with rawhide gloves:\rlet everyone be there and hope for the prize of a well-deserved\rpalm branch. All be silent now, and wreathe your brows.\xc3\x93\rSo saying he veiled his forehead with his mother\xc3\x95s myrtle.\rHelymus did likewise, Acestes of mature years, the boy\rAscanius, and the rest of the people followed.\rThen he went with many thousands, from the gathering\rto the grave-mound, in the midst of the vast accompanying throng.\rHere with due offering he poured two bowls of pure wine\ronto the ground, two of fresh milk, two of sacrificial blood,\rand, scattering bright petals, he spoke as follows:\r\xc3\x92Once more, hail, my sacred father: hail, spirit,\rghost, ashes of my father, whom I rescued in vain.\rI was not allowed to search, with you, for Italy\xc3\x95s borders,\rour destined fields, or Ausonia\xc3\x95s Tiber, wherever it might be.\xc3\x93\rHe had just finished speaking when a shining snake unwound \reach of its seven coils from the base of the shrine,\rin seven large loops, placidly encircling the mound, and gliding\ramong the altars, its back mottled with blue-green markings,\rand its scales burning with a golden sheen, as a rainbow forms\ra thousand varied colours in clouds opposite the sun.\rAeneas was stunned by the sight. Finally, with a long glide\ramong the bowls and polished drinking cups, the serpent \rtasted the food, and, having fed, departed the altar, \rretreating harmlessly again into the depths of the tomb. \rAeneas returned more eagerly to the tribute to his father, \runcertain whether to treat the snake as the guardian of the place, \ror as his father\xc3\x95s attendant spirit: he killed two sheep as customary,\rtwo pigs, and as many black-backed heifers:\rand poured wine from the bowls, and called on the spirit\rand shadow of great Anchises, released from Acheron.\rAnd his companions as well, brought gifts gladly, of which\reach had a store, piling high the altars, sacrificing bullocks:\rothers set out rows of cauldrons, and scattered among the grass,\rplaced live coals under the spits, and roasted the meat. \r\rBKV:104-150 THE START OF THE GAMES\r\rThe eagerly-awaited day had arrived, and now \rPhaethon\xc3\x95s horses brought a ninth dawn of cloudless light,\rand Acestes\xc3\x95s name and reputation had roused the countryside:\rthey thronged the shore, a joyous crowd,\rsome to see Aeneas and his men, others to compete.\rFirst the prizes were set out for them to see in the centre\rof the circuit, sacred tripods, green crowns and palms,\rrewards for the winners, armour, and clothes dyed with purple, \rand talents of silver and gold: and a trumpet sang out, \rfrom a central mound, that the games had begun. \rFour well-matched ships with heavy oars \rwere chosen from the fleet for the first event.\rMnesthus, soon to be Mnesthus of Italy from whom \rthe Memmian people are named, captains the Sea-Serpent, \rwith its eager crew: Gyas, the vast Chimaera of huge bulk,\ra floating city, rowed by the Trojan men \ron three decks, with the oars raised in triple rows:\rSergestus, from whom the house of Sergia gets its name,\rsails in the great Centaur, and Cloanthus from whom \ryour family derives, Cluentius of Rome, in the sea-green Scylla.\rThere\xc3\x95s a rock far out at sea opposite the foaming shore,\rwhich, lashed by the swollen waves, is sometimes drowned,\rwhen wintry north-westerlies hide the stars: \rit is quiet in calm weather and flat ground is raised above\rthe motionless water, a welcome haunt for sun-loving sea-birds.\rHere our ancestor Aeneas set up a leafy oak-trunk\ras a mark, as a sign for the sailors to know where \rto turn back, and circle round the long course. \rThen they chose places by lot, and the captains themselves, on \rthe sterns, gleamed from a distance, resplendent in purple and gold:\rthe rest of the men were crowned with poplar leaves,\rand their naked shoulders glistened, shining with oil.\rThey manned the benches, arms ready at the oars:\rreadied for action they waited for the signal, and pounding fear,\rand the desire aroused for glory, devoured their leaping hearts.\rThen when the clear trumpet gave the signal, all immediately\rshot forward from the starting line, the sailor\xc3\x95s shouts\rstruck the heavens, as arms were plied the waters turned to foam.\rthey cut the furrows together, and the whole surface \rgaped wide, ploughed by the oars and the three-pronged beaks.\rThe speed is not as great when the two horse chariots \rhit the field in their race, shooting from their stalls:\rand the charioteers shake the rippling reins over their\rgalloping team, straining forward to the lash.\rSo the whole woodland echoes with applause, the shouts\rof men, and the partisanship of their supporters,\rthe sheltered beach concentrates the sound \rand the hills, reverberating, return the clamour.\r\rBKV:151-243 THE BOAT RACE\r\rGyas runs before the pack, and glides forward on the waves,\ramongst the noise and confusion: Cloanthus follows next,\rhis ship better manned, but held back by its weight.\rAfter them separated equally the Sea-Serpent \rand the Centaur strain to win a lead:\rnow the Sea-Serpent has it, now the huge Centaur wins in front,\rnow both sweep on together their bows level,\rtheir long keels ploughing the salt sea.\rNow they near the rock and are close to the marker,\rwhen Gyas, the leader, winning at the half-way point,\rcalls out loudly to his pilot Menoetes:\r\xc3\x92Why so far adrift to starboard? Steer her course this way:\rhug the shore and graze the crags to port, oars raised:\rlet others keep to deep water.\xc3\x93 He spoke, but Menoetes\rfearing unseen reefs wrenched the prow towards the open sea.\r\xc3\x92Why so far adrift?\xc3\x93 again, \xc3\x92Head for the rocks, Menoetes!\xc3\x93\rhe shouts to him forcefully, and behold, he sees Cloanthus\rright at his back and taking the riskier course.\rHe squeezed a path between Gyas\xc3\x95s ship and the booming rocks\rinside to starboard, suddenly passing the leader,\rand, leaving the marker behind, reached safe water.\rThen indeed great indignation burned in the young man\xc3\x95s marrow,\rand there were tears on his cheeks, and forgetting his own pride\rand his crew\xc3\x95s safety he heaved the timid Menoetes\rheadlong into the sea from the high stern:\rhe stood to the helm, himself captain and steersman,\rurged on his men, and turned for the shore.\rBut when Menoetes old as he was, clawed his way back heavily\rand with difficulty at last from the sea floor, he climbed to the top\rof the crag and sat down on the dry rock dripping, in his wet\rclothing. The Trojans laughed as he fell, and swam\rand laughed as he vomited the seawater from his chest.\rAt this a joyful hope of passing Gyas, as he stalled,\ris aroused in Sergestus and Mnestheus, the two behind,\rSergestus takes the leading place and nears the rock,\rstill he\xc3\x95s not a full ship\xc3\x95s length in front, only part:\rthe rival Sea-Serpent closes on him with her prow.\rThen, Mnesthus walking among his crew amidships\rexhorted them: \xc3\x92Now, now rise to the oars, comrades\rof Hector, you whom I chose as companions at Troy\xc3\x95s\rlast fatal hour: now, exert all that strength, \rthat spirit you showed in the Gaetulian shoals, \rthe Ionian Sea, and Cape Malea\xc3\x95s pursuing waves.\rNow I, Mnesthus, do not seek to be first or try to win \xc3\x90\rlet those conquer whom you have granted to do so, Neptune \xc3\x90\rbut oh, it would be shameful to return last: achieve this for us,\rcountrymen, and prevent our disgrace.\xc3\x93 They bend to it \rwith fierce rivalry: the bronze stern shudders at their powerful\rstrokes: and the sea-floor drops away beneath them: \rthen shallow breathing makes limbs and parched lips quiver.\rand their sweat runs down in streams. \rChance brings the men the glory that they long for.\rWhen Segestus, his spirit raging, forces his bows, \ron the inside, towards the rocks, and enters\rdangerous water, unhappily he strikes the jutting reef.\rThe cliff shakes, the oars jam against them, and snap\ron the sharp edges of stone, and the prow hangs there, snagged.\rThe sailors leap up, and, shouting aloud at the delay,\rgather iron-tipped poles and sharply-pointed boathooks,\rand rescue their smashed oars from the water.\rBut Mnesthus, delighted, and made eager by his success,\rwith a swift play of oars, and a prayer to the winds.\rheads for home waters and courses the open sea,\ras a dove, whose nest and sweet chicks are hidden \ramong the rocks, suddenly startled from some hollow,\rtakes flight for the fields, frightened from her cover,\rand beats her wings loudly, but soon gliding in still air\rskims her clear path, barely moving her swift pinions:\rin this way Mnestheus and the Sea-Dragon herself furrow \rthe final stretch of water in flight, and her impetus\ralone, carries her on her winged path. Firstly\rhe leaves Segestus behind struggling on the raised rock\rthen in shoal water, calling vainly for help,\rand learning how to race with shattered oars.\rThen he overhauls Gyas and the Chimaera\xc3\x95s huge bulk:\rwhich, deprived of her helmsman now, gives way.\rNow Cloanthus alone is left ahead, near to the finish,\rMnestheus heads for him and chases closely\rexerting all his powers. Then indeed the shouts redouble,\rand together all enthusiastically urge on the pursuer.\rThe former crew are unhappy lest they fail to keep\rthe honour that is theirs and the glory already \rin their possession, and would sell their lives for fame.\rthe latter feed on success: they can because they think they can.\rAnd with their prow alongside they might have snatched the prize,\rif Cleanthus had not stretched out his hands over the sea\rand poured out his prayers, and called to the gods in longing.\r\xc3\x92Gods, whose empire is the ocean, whose waters I course,\rOn shore, I will gladly set a snow-white bull \rbefore your altars, in payment of my vows, \rthrow the entrailsinto the saltwater, and pour out pure wine.\xc3\x93 \rHe spoke, and all the Nereids, Phorcus\xc3\x95s choir, and virgin Panopea,\rheard him in the wave\xc3\x95s depths, and father Portunus drove him\ron his track, with his great hand: the ship ran to shore, swifter\rthan south wind or flying arrow, and plunged into the deep harbour.\r \rBKV:244-285 THE PRIZE-GIVING FOR THE BOAT RACE\r\rThen Anchises\xc3\x95s son, calling them all together as is fitting,\rby the herald\xc3\x95s loud cry declares Cloanthus the winner,\rand wreathes his forehead with green laurel, and tells him\rto choose three bullocks, and wine, and a large talent of silver\ras gifts for the ships. He adds special honours for the captains:\ra cloak worked in gold for the victor, edged \rwith Meliboean deep purple in a double meandering line,\rGanymede the boy-prince woven on it, as if breathless \rwith eagerness, running with his javelin, chasing the swift stags\ron leafy Ida: whom Jupiter\xc3\x95s eagle, carrier of the lightning-bolt,\rhas now snatched up into the air, from Ida, with taloned feet:\rhis aged guards stretch their hands to the sky in vain,\rand the barking dogs snap at the air. He gives to the warrior, \rwho took second place by his prowess, a coat of mail for his own,\rwith polished hooks, in triple woven gold, a beautiful thing\rand a defence in battle, that he himself as victor had taken\rfrom Demoleos, by the swift Simois, below the heights of Ilium.\rPhegeus and Sagaris, his servants, can barely carry its folds,\ron straining shoulders: though, wearing it, Demoleus \rused to drive the scattered Trojans at a run. \rHe grants the third prize of a pair of bronze cauldrons\rand bowls made of silver with designs in bold relief.\rNow they have all received their gifts and are walking off,\rforeheads tied with scarlet ribbons, proud of their new wealth,\rwhen Segestus, who showing much skill has with difficulty\rgot clear of the cruel rock, oars missing and one tier useless,\rbrings in his boat, to mockery and no glory. \rAs a snake, that a bronze-rimmed wheel has crossed obliquely,\ris often caught on the curb of a road, or like one that a passer-by\rhas crushed with a heavy blow from a stone and left half-dead, \rwrithes its long coils, trying in vain to escape, part aggressive, \rwith blazing eyes, and hissing, its neck raised high in the air,\rpart held back by the constraint of its wounds, struggling\rto follow with its coils, and twining back on its own length:\rso the ship moves slowly on with wrecked oars:\rnevertheless she makes sail, and under full sail reaches harbour.\rAeneas presents Sergestus with the reward he promised,\rhappy that the ship is saved, and the crew rescued.\rHe is granted a Cretan born slave-girl, Pholoe, not unskilled\rin the arts of Minerva, nursing twin boys at her breast.\r\rBKV:286-361 THE FOOT RACE\r\rOnce this race was done Aeneas headed for a grassy space,\rcircled round about by curving wooded hillsides,\rforming an amphitheatre at the valley\xc3\x95s centre: \rthe hero took himself there in the midst of the throng \rmany thousands strong, and occupied a raised throne. \rHere if any by chance wanted to compete in the footrace\rhe tempted their minds with the reward, and set the prizes.\rTrojans and Sicilians gathered together from all sides,\rNisus and Euryalus the foremost among them,\rEuryalus famed for his beauty, and in the flower of youth,\rNisus famed for his devoted affection for the lad: next\rcame princely Diores, of Priam\xc3\x95s royal blood,\rthen Salius and Patron together, one an Arcanian,\rthe other of Arcadian blood and Tegean race:\rthen two young Sicilians, Helymus and Panopes,\rused to the forests, companions of old Acestes:\rand many others too, whose fame is lost in obscurity.\rThen Aeneas amongst them spoke as follows:\r\xc3\x92Take these words to heart, and give pleasurable attention.\rNone of your number will go away without a reward from me.\rI\xc3\x95ll give two Cretan arrows, shining with polished steel, \rfor each man, to take away, and a double-headed axe chased \rwith silver: all who are present will receive the same honour. \rThe first three will share prizes, and their heads will be crowned\rwith pale-green olive: let the first as winner take a horse\rdecorated with trappings: the second an Amazonian quiver,\rfilled with Thracian arrows, looped with a broad belt of gold\rand fastened by a clasp with a polished gem:\rlet the third leave content with this Argive helmet.\xc3\x93\rWhen he had finished they took their places and, suddenly,\ron hearing the signal, they left the barrier and shot onto the course,\rstreaming out like a storm cloud, gaze fixed on the goal.\rNisus was off first, and darted away, ahead of all the others,\rfaster than the wind or the winged lightning-bolt:\rSalius followed behind him, but a long way behind:\rthen after a space Euryalus was third: Helymus \rpursued Euryalus, and there was Diores speeding near him,\rnow touching foot to foot, leaning at his shoulder: \rif the course had been longer he\xc3\x95d have \rslipped past him, and left the outcome in doubt.\rNow, wearied, almost at the end of the track, \rthey neared the winning post itself, when the unlucky Nisus\rfell in some slippery blood, which when the bullocks were killed\rhad chanced to drench the ground and the green grass. \rHere the youth, already rejoicing at winning, failed to keep\rhis sliding feet on the ground, but fell flat, \rstraight in the slimy dirt and sacred blood. \rBut he didn\xc3\x95t forget Euryalus even then, nor his love:\rbut, picking himself up out of the wet, obstructed Salius,\rwho fell head over heels onto the thick sand.\rEuryalus sped by and, darting onwards to applause and the shouts\rof his supporters, took first place, winning with his friend\xc3\x95s help.\rHelymus came in behind him, then Diores, now in third place.\rAt this Salius filled the whole vast amphitheatre, and the faces\rof the foremost elders, with his loud clamour,\rdemanding to be given the prize stolen from him by a trick.\rHis popularity protects Euryalus, and fitting tears,\rand ability is more pleasing in a beautiful body.\rDiores encourages him, and protests in a loud voice,\rhaving reached the palm, but claiming the last prize in vain,\rif the highest honour goes to Salius.\rThen Aeneas the leader said, \xc3\x92Your prizes are still yours,\rlads, and no one is altering the order of attainment:\rbut allow me to take pity on an unfortunate friend\xc3\x95s fate.\xc3\x93\rSo saying he gives Salius the huge pelt of a Gaetulian lion,\rheavy with shaggy fur, its claws gilded.\rAt this Nisus comments: \xc3\x92If these are the prizes for losing,\rand you pity the fallen, what fitting gift will you grant to Nisus,\rwho would have earned first place through merit\rif ill luck had not dogged me, as it did Salius?\xc3\x93\rAnd with that he shows his face and limbs drenched\rwith foul mud. The best of leaders smiles at him,\rand orders a shield to be brought, the work of Didymaon,\ronce unpinned by the Greeks from Neptune\xc3\x95s sacred threshold:\rthis outstanding prize he gives to the noble youth.\r\rBKV:362-484 THE BOXING CONTEST\r\rWhen the races were done and the gifts allotted,\rAeneas cried: \xc3\x92Now, he who has skill and courage in his heart,\rlet him stand here and raise his arms, his fists bound in hide.\xc3\x93\rSo saying he set out the double prize for the boxing,\ra bullock for the winner, dressed with gold and sacred ribbons,\rand a sword and a noble helmet to console the defeated.\rWithout delay Dares, hugely strong, raised his face\rand rose, to a great murmur from the crowd,\rhe who alone used to compete with Paris,\rand by that same mound where mighty Hector lies\rhe struck the victorious Butes, borne of the Bebrycian\rrace of Amycus, as he came forward, vast in bulk,\rand stretched him dying on the yellow sand. \rSuch was Dares who lifted his head up for the bout at once,\rshowed his broad shoulders, stretched his arms out, sparring\rto right and left, and threw punches at the air.\rA contestant was sought for him, but no one from all that crowd\rdared face the man, or pull the gloves on his hands.\rSo, cheerfully thinking they had all conceded the prize, he stands\rbefore Aeneas, and without more delay holds the bullock\xc3\x95s horn \rin his left hand and says: \xc3\x92Son of the goddess, if no one dare\rcommit himself to fight, when will my standing here end? \rHow long is it right for me to be kept waiting? Order me to lead\ryour gift away.\xc3\x93 All the Trojans together shout their approval, \rand demand that what was promised be granted him.\rAt this Entellus upbraids Acestes, sitting next to him \ron a stretch of green grass, with grave words:\r\xc3\x92Entellus, once the bravest of heroes, was it all in vain,\rwill you let so great a prize be carried off without a struggle,\rand so tamely? Where\xc3\x95s our divine master, Eryx, now,\rfamous to no purpose? Where\xc3\x95s your name throughout Sicily,\rand why are those spoils of battle hanging in your house?\xc3\x93\rTo this Entellus replies: \xc3\x92It\xc3\x95s not that quelled by fear, pride or love\rof fame has died: but my chill blood is dull with age\xc3\x95s sluggishness,\rand the vigour in my body is lifeless and exhausted.\rIf I had what I once had, which that boaster enjoys \rand relies on, if that youthfulness were mine now, \rthen I\xc3\x95d certainly have stepped forward, but not seduced\rby prizes or handsome bullocks: I don\xc3\x95t care about gifts.\xc3\x93\rHaving spoken he throws a pair of gloves of immense weight\rwhich fierce Eryx, binding the tough hide onto his hands, \rused to fight in, into the middle of the ring. Their minds \rare stunned: huge pieces of hide from seven massive oxen \rare stiff with the iron and lead sewn into them. Above all \rDares himself is astonished, and declines the bout from a distance,\rand Anchises\xc3\x95s noble son turns the huge volume \rand weight of the gloves backwards and forwards.\rThen the older man speaks like this, from his heart:\r\xc3\x92What if you\xc3\x95d seen the arms and gloves of Hercules \rhimself, and the fierce fight on this very shore?\rYour brother Eryx once wore these (you see that\rthey\xc3\x95re still stained with blood and brain matter)\rHe faced great Hercules in them: I used to fight in them\rwhen more vigorous blood granted me strength,\rand envious age had not yet sprinkled my brow with snow.\rBut if a Trojan, Dares, shrinks from these gloves of ours,\rand good Aeneas accepts it, and Acestes my sponsor agrees,\rlet\xc3\x95s level the odds. I\xc3\x95ll forgo the gloves of Eryx \r(banish your fears): you, throw off your Trojan ones.\xc3\x93\rSo speaking he flings his double-sided cloak from his shoulders,\rbaring the massive muscles of his limbs, his thighs\rwith their huge bones, and stands, a giant, in the centre of the arena.\rThen our ancestor, Anchises\xc3\x95s son, lifts up a like pair of gloves,\rand protects the hands of both contestants equally.\rImmediately each takes up his stance, poised on his toes,\rand fearlessly raises his arms high in front of him.\rKeeping their heads up and well away from the blows\rthey begin to spar, fist to fist, and provoke a battle,\rthe one better at moving his feet, relying on his youth,\rthe other powerful in limbs and bulk: but his slower legs quiver,\rhis knees are unsteady, and painful gasps shake his huge body. \rThey throw many hard punches at each other but in vain,\rthey land many on their curved flanks, or their chests \rare thumped loudly, gloves often stray to ears\rand brows, and jaws rattle under the harsh blows.\rEntellus stands solidly, not moving, in the same stance,\ravoiding the blows with his watchful eyes and body alone.\rDares, like someone who lays siege to a towering city,\ror surrounds a mountain fortress with weapons,\rtries this opening and that, seeking everywhere, with his art, \rand presses hard with varied but useless assaults.\rThen Entellus standing up to him, extends his raised right:\rthe other, foreseeing the downward angle of the imminent blow,\rslides his nimble body aside, and retreats:\rEntellus wastes his effort on the air and the heavy man\rfalls to the ground heavily, with his whole weight,\ras a hollow pine-tree, torn up by its roots, sometimes falls\ron Mount Erymanthus or mighty Mount Ida.\rThe Trojans and the Sicilan youths leap up eagerly:\ra shout lifts to the sky, and Acestes is the first to run forward\rand with sympathy raises his old friend from the ground.\rBut that hero, not slowed or deterred by his fall,\rreturns more eagerly to the fight, and generates power from anger.\rThen shame and knowledge of his own ability revive his strength,\rand he drives Dares in fury headlong across the whole arena,\rdoubling his punches now, to right and left. No pause, or rest:\rlike the storm clouds rattling their dense hailstones on the roof,\ras heavy are the blows from either hand, as the hero\rcontinually batters at Dares and destroys him.\rThen Aeneas, their leader, would not allow the wrath to continue\rlonger, nor Entellus to rage with such bitterness of spirit,\rbut put an end to the contest, and rescued the weary Dares,\rspeaking gently to him with these words:\r\xc3\x92Unlucky man, why let such savagery depress your spirits?\rDon\xc3\x95t you see another has the power: the gods have changed sides?\rYield to the gods.\xc3\x93 He spoke and, speaking, broke up the fight.\rBut Dare\xc3\x95s loyal friends led him away to the ships, \rhis weakened knees collapsing, his head swaying from side to side,\rspitting out clots of blood from his mouth, teeth amongst them.\rCalled back they accept the helmet and sword, \rleaving the winner\xc3\x95s palm and the bullock for Entellus.\rAt this the victor exultant in spirit and glorying in the bullock,\rsaid: \xc3\x92Son of the Goddess, and all you Trojans, \rknow now what physical strength I had in my youth, \rand from what fate you\xc3\x95ve recalled and rescued Dares.\xc3\x93 \rHe spoke and planted himself opposite the bullock,\rstill standing there as prize for the bout, then, drawing back \rhis right fist, aimed the hard glove between the horns\rand broke its skull scattering the brains: the ox\rfell quivering to the ground, stretched out lifeless.\rStanding over it he poured these words from his chest:\r\xc3\x92Eryx, I offer you this, the better animal, for Dares\xc3\x95s life:\rthe winner here, I relinquish the gloves and my art.\xc3\x93\r\rBKV:485-544 THE ARCHERY CONTEST\r\rImmediately Aeneas invites together all who might wish \rto compete with their swift arrows, and sets out the prizes.\rWith a large company he raises a mast from Serestus\xc3\x95s ship,\rand ties a fluttering dove, at which they can aim\rtheir shafts, to a cord piercing the high mast. \rThe men gather and a bronze helmet receives the lots\rtossed into it: the first of them all to be drawn,\rto cheers of support, is Hippocoon son of Hyrtaces,\rfollowed by Mnestheus, the winner of the boat race \ra while ago: Mnestheus crowned with green olive.\rEurytion\xc3\x95s the third, your brother, O famous Pandorus,\rwho, ordered to wreck the treaty, in the past,\rwas the first to hurl his spear amongst the Greeks.\rAcestes is the last name out from the depths of the helmet,\rdaring to try his own hand at the youthful contest.\rThen they take arrows from their quivers, and, each man\rfor himself, with vigorous strength, bends the bow into an arc,\rand first through the air from the twanging string\rthe son of Hyrcanus\xc3\x95s shaft, cutting the swift breeze,\rreaches the mark, and strikes deep into the mast.\rThe mast quivered, the bird fluttered its wings in fear,\rand there was loud applause from all sides.\rThen Mnestheus eagerly took his stand with bent bow,\raiming high, his arrow notched level with his eyes.\rBut to his dismay he was not able to hit the bird \rherself with the shaft, but broke the knots of hemp cord\rthat tied her foot as it hung from the mast:\rshe fled to the north wind and the dark clouds, in flight.\rThen Eurytion who had been holding his bow ready, with drawn\rarrow for some time, called on his brother to note his vow,\rquickly eyed the dove, enjoying the freedom of the skies, \rand transfixed her, as she beat her wings beneath a dark cloud. \rShe dropped lifeless, leaving her spirit with the starry heavens,\rand, falling, brought back to earth the shaft that pierced her.\rAcestes alone remained: the prize was lost:\ryet he still shot his arrow high into the air,\rshowing an older man\xc3\x95s skill, the bow twanging. Then \ra sudden wonder appeared before their eyes, destined to be\rof great meaning: the time to come unveiled its crucial outcome,\rand great seers of the future celebrated it as an omen.\rThe arrow, flying through the passing clouds, caught fire\rmarked out its path with flames, then vanished into thin air,\ras shooting stars, loosed from heaven often transit\rthe sky, drawing their tresses after them. Astonished,\rthe Trinacrians and Trojans stood rooted to the spot, \rpraying to the gods: nor did their great leader Aeneas\rreject the sign, but embracing the joyful Acestes,\rloaded him with handsome gifts and spoke as follows:\r\xc3\x92Take these, old man: since the high king of Olympus shows,\rby these omens, that he wishes you to take extraordinary honours.\rYou shall have this gift, owned by aged Anchises himself, \ra bowl engraved with figures, that Cisseus of Thrace\ronce long ago gave Anchises my father as a memento\rof himself, and as a pledge of his friendship.\xc3\x93\rSo saying he wreathed his brow with green laurel\rand proclaimed Acestes the highest victor among them all.\rNor did good Eurytion begrudge the special prize,\rthough he alone brought the bird down from the sky.\rNext he who cut the cord stepped forward for his reward,\rand lastly he who\xc3\x95s swift shaft had transfixed the mast.\r\rBKV:545-603 THE EXHIBITION OF HORSEMANSHIP \r\rBut before the match is complete Aeneas the leader\rcalls Epytides to him, companion and guardian \rof young Iulus, and speaks into his loyal ear:\r\xc3\x92Off! Go! Tell Ascanius, if he has his troop of boys\rready with him, and is prepared for the horse-riding\rto show himself with his weapons, and lead them out\rin honour of his grandfather.\xc3\x93 He himself orders the whole \rcrowd of people to leave the lengthy circuit, emptying the field. \rThe boys arrive, and glitter together on their bridled horses\runder their fathers\xc3\x95 gaze, and the men of Troy \rand Sicily murmur in admiration as they go by.\rThey all have their hair properly circled by a cut garland:\rthey each carry two cornel-wood spears tipped with steel,\rsome have shining quivers on their shoulders: a flexible\rtorque of twisted gold sits high on their chests around the neck.\rThe troops of horse are three in number, and three leaders\rride ahead: two groups of six boys follow each,\rcommanded alike and set out in gleaming ranks.\rOne line of youths is led joyfully by little Priam,\rrecalling his grandfather\xc3\x95s name, your noble child,\rPolites, seed of the Italians: whom a piebald \rThracian horse carries, showing white pasterns\ras it steps, and a high white forehead. \rNext is Atys, from whom the Latin Atii trace their line,\rlittle Atys, a boy loved by the boy Iulus.\rLast, and most handsome of all in appearance,\rIulus himself rides a Sidonian horse, that radiant Dido\rhad given him as a remembrance of herself, \rand a token of her love. The rest of the youths\rride the Sicilian horses of old Acestes.\rThe Trojans greet the shy lads with applause, and delight\rin gazing at them, seeing their ancient families in their faces.\rWhen they have ridden happily round the whole assembly \runder the eyes of their kin, Epytides with a prolonged cry\rgives the agreed signal and cracks his whip.\rThey gallop apart in two equal detachments, the three\rgroups parting company, and dissolving their columns,\rthen, recalled, they wheel round, and charge with level lances.\rThen they perform other figures and counter-figures\rin opposing ranks, and weave in circles inside counter-circles,\rand perform a simulated battle with weapons.\rNow their backs are exposed in flight, now they turn\rtheir spears to charge, now ride side by side in peace.\rLike the Labyrinth in mountainous Crete, they say, \rthat contained a path winding between blind walls,\rwandering with guile through a thousand turnings,\rso that undetected and irretraceable errors \rmight foil any guidelines that might be followed:\rso the Trojan children twine their steps in just such a pattern,\rweaving battle and flight, in their display, like dolphins\rswimming through the ocean streams, cutting the Carpathian\rand Lybian waters, and playing among the waves.\rAscanius first revived this kind of riding, and this contest,\rwhen he encircled Alba Longa with walls, and taught the Early\rLatins to celebrate it in the way he and the Trojan youth \rhad done together: the Albans taught their children: mighty Rome\rreceived it from them in turn, and preserved the ancestral rite:\rand today the boys are called \xc3\x94Troy\xc3\x95 and their procession \xc3\x94Trojan\xc3\x95.\rSo the games are completed celebrating Aeneas\xc3\x95s sacred father.\r\rBKV:604-663 JUNO SENDS IRIS TO FIRE THE TROJAN SHIPS\r\rHere Fortune first alters, switching loyalties. While they, \rwith their various games, are paying due honours to the tomb,\rSaturnian Juno sends Iris down from the sky to the Trojan fleet,\rbreathing out a breeze for her passage, thinking deeply\rabout her ancient grievance which is yet unsatisfied.\rIris, hurrying on her way along a rainbow\xc3\x95s thousand colours\rspeeds swiftly down her track, a girl unseen.\rShe views the great crowd, and scans the shore,\rsees the harbour deserted, and the ships abandoned.\rBut far away on the lonely sands the Trojan women\rare weeping Anchises\xc3\x95s loss, and all, weeping, gaze\rat the deep ocean. \xc3\x92Ah, what waves and seas are still left\rfor weary folk!\xc3\x93 They are all of one voice. They pray for \ra city: they tire of enduring suffering on the waves.\rSo Iris, not ignorant of mischief, darts among them,\rsetting aside the appearance and robes of a goddess:\rbecoming Beroe, the old wife of Tmarian Doryclus,\rwho had once had family, sons, and a famous name. \rand as such moves among the Trojan mothers, saying:\r\xc3\x92O wretched ones, whom Greek hands failed to drag\rto death in the war beneath our native walls! \rO unhappy people what fate does Fortune reserve for you?\rThe seventh summer is on the turn since Troy\xc3\x95s destruction,\rand we endure the crossing of every sea and shore, so many\rinhospitable stones and stars, while we chase over the vast sea \rafter an Italy that flees from us, tossing upon the waves.\rHere are the borders of our brother Eryx and our host Acestes:\rwhat stops us building walls and granting our citizens a city?\rO fatherland, O gods of our houses, rescued from the enemy \rin vain, will no city now be called Troy? Shall I see\rnowhere a Xanthus or a Simois, Hector\xc3\x95s rivers?\rCome now, and burn these accursed ships with me.\rFor the ghost of Cassandra, the prophetess, seemed to hand me\rburning torches in dream: \xc3\x94Seek Troy here: here is \ryour home\xc3\x95 she said. Now is the time for deeds, \rnot delay, given such portents. See, four altars to Neptune:\rthe god himself lends us fire and the courage.\xc3\x93\rSo saying she first of all firmly seizes the dangerous flame\rand, straining to lift it high, brandishes it, and hurls it.\rThe minds of the Trojan women are startled, and their wits\rstunned. Here, one of the crowd, Pyrgo, the eldest,\rthe royal nurse of so many of Priam\xc3\x95s sons, says:\r\xc3\x92This is not Beroe, you women, this is no wife\rof Rhoetitian Doryclus: look at the signs of divine beauty\rand the burning eyes, the spirit she possesses,\rher form, the sound of her voice, her footsteps as she moves.\rJust now I myself left Beroe, sick and unhappy, that she alone\rwas missing so important a rite and could not pay Anchises \rthe offerings due to him.\xc3\x93 So she speaks. At first the women\rgaze in uncertainty at the ships, with angry glances, \rtorn between a wretched yearning for the land \rthey have reached, and the kingdom fate calls them to,\rwhen the goddess, climbs the sky on soaring wings,\rcutting a giant rainbow in her flight through the clouds.\rThen truly amazed at the wonder, and driven by madness,\rthey cry out and some snatch fire from the innermost hearths,\rothers strip the altars, and throw on leaves and twigs \rand burning brands. Fire rages unchecked among \rthe benches, and oars, and the hulls of painted pine.\r\r\r\rBKV:664-699 THE FLEET IS SAVED\r\rEumelus carries the news of the burning ships to Anchises\xc3\x95s tomb\rand the ranks of the ampitheatre, and looking behind them\rthey themselves see dark ash floating upwards in a cloud.\rAscanius is first to turn his horse eagerly towards the troubled\rencampment, as joyfully as he led his galloping troop,\rand his breathless guardians cannot reign him back.\r\xc3\x92What new madness is this? He cries. \xc3\x92What now, what do you \raim at, wretched women? You\xc3\x95re burning your own hopes\rnot the enemy, nor a hostile Greek camp. See I am\ryour Ascanius!\xc3\x93 And he flung his empty helmet in front of his feet,\rthat he\xc3\x95d worn as he\xc3\x95d inspired his pretence of battle in play.\rAeneas hurries there too, and the Trojan companies.\rBut the women scatter in fear here and there along the shore,\rand stealthily head for the woods and any cavernous rocks:\rthey hate what they\xc3\x95ve done and the light, with sober minds\rthey recognise their kin, and Juno is driven from their hearts.\rBut the roaring flames don\xc3\x95t lose their indomitable fury\rjust for that: the pitch is alight under the wet timbers,\rslowly belching smoke, the keel is gradually burned,\rand the pestilence sinks through a whole hull,\rnor are heroic strength or floods of water any use.\rThen virtuous Aeneas tears the clothes from his chest,\rand calls on the gods for help, lifting his hands:\r\xc3\x92All-powerful Jupiter, if you don\xc3\x95t hate the Trojans\rto a man, if your former affection has regard \rfor human suffering, let the fleet escape the flames now,\rFather, and save our slender Trojan hopes from ruin:\ror if I deserve this, send what is left of us to death with your\rangry lightning-bolt, and overwhelm us with your hand.\xc3\x93\rHe had barely spoken, when a dark storm with pouring rain\rrages without check and the high hills and plains \rquake with thunder: a murky downpour falls \rfrom the whole sky, the blackest of heavy southerlies,\rand the ships are brimming, the half-burnt timbers soaked,\runtil all the heat is quenched, and all the hulls\rexcept four, are saved from the pestilence.\r\rBKV:700-745 NAUTES\xc3\x95 ADVICE AND ANCHISES\xc3\x95 GHOST \r\rBut Aeneas, the leader, stunned by the bitter blow,\rpondered his great worries, turning them this way\rand that in his mind. Should he settle in Sicily\xc3\x95s fields,\rforgetting his destiny, or strike out for Italian shores?\rThen old Nautes, whom alone Tritonian Pallas had taught,\rand rendered famous for his great skill (she gave him \ranswers, telling what the great gods\xc3\x95 anger portended, \ror what the course of destiny demanded),\rbegan to solace Aeneas with these words:\r\xc3\x92Son of the Goddess, let us follow wherever fate ebbs or flows,\rwhatever comes, every fortune may be conquered by endurance.\rYou have Trojan Acestes of the line of the gods:\rlet him share your decisions and be a willing partner,\rentrust to him those who remain from the lost ships, \rand those tired of your great venture and your affairs:\rSelect also aged men and women exhausted by the sea,\rand anyone with you who is frail, or afraid of danger,\rand let the weary have their city in this land:\rand if agreed they will call it by Acestes\xc3\x95s name.\xc3\x93\rThen roused by such words from an aged friend,\rAeneas\xc3\x95s heart was truly torn between so many cares. \rAnd now black Night in her chariot, borne upwards,\roccupied the heavens: and the likeness of his father Anchises\rseemed to glide down from the sky, and speak so:\r\xc3\x92Son, dearer to me than life, when life remained, \rmy son, troubled by Troy\xc3\x95s fate, I come here \rat Jove\xc3\x95s command, he who drove the fire from the ships, \rand at last takes pity on you from high heaven.\rFollow the handsome advice that old Nautus gives:\rtake chosen youth, and the bravest hearts, to Italy.\rIn Latium you must subdue a tough race, harshly trained. \rYet, first, go to the infernal halls of Dis, and in deep \rAvernus seek a meeting with me, my son. For impious\rTartarus, with its sad shades, does not hold me, \rI live in Elysium, and the lovely gatherings of the blessed.\rHere the chaste Sibyl will bring you, with much blood of\rblack sheep. Then you\xc3\x95ll learn all about your race, \rand the city granted you. Now: farewell. Dew-wet Night\rturns mid-course, and cruel Morning, with panting steeds,\rbreathes on me.\xc3\x93 He spoke and fled like smoke into thin air.\r\xc3\x92Where are you rushing to? Aeneas cried, \xc3\x92Where are you\rhurrying? Who do you flee? Who bars you from my embrace?\xc3\x93\rSo saying he revived the embers of the slumbering fires, and \rpaid reverence, humbly, with sacred grain and a full censer, \rto the Trojan Lar, and the inner shrine of white-haired Vesta.\r\rBKV:746-778 DEPARTURE FROM SICILY\r\rImmediately he summoned his companions, Acestes first of all,\rand told them of Jove\xc3\x95s command, and his dear father\xc3\x95s counsel,\rand the decision he had reached in his mind. There was little delay\rin their discussions, and Acestes did not refuse to accept his orders.\rThey transferred the women to the new city\xc3\x95s roll, and settled\rthere those who wished, spirits with no desire for great glory.\rThey themselves, thinned in their numbers, but with manhood\rfully alive to war, renewed the rowing benches, and replaced\rthe timbers of the ships burnt by fire, and fitted oars and rigging.\rMeanwhile Aeneas marked out the city limits with a plough\rand allocated houses: he declared that this was Ilium \rand this place Troy. Acestes the Trojan revelled in his kingdom,\rappointed a court, and gave out laws to the assembled senate.\rThen a shrine of Venus of Idalia was dedicated,\rclose to the stars, on the tip of Eryx, and they added\ra stretch of sacred grove, and a priest, to Anchises\xc3\x95s tomb.\rWhen all the people had feasted for nine days, and offerings\rhad been made at the altars, gentle winds calmed the waves\rand a strong Southerly called them again to sea.\rA great weeping rose along the curving shore:\ra day and a night they clung together in delay.\rNow the women themselves, to whom the face of the ocean\rhad once seemed cruel, and its name intolerable,\rwish to go and suffer all the toils of exile.\rGood Aeneas comforts them with kind words\rand commends them to his kinsman Acestes with tears.\rThen he orders three calves to be sacrificed to Eryx,\ra lamb to the Storm-gods, and for the hawsers to be duly freed.\rHe himself, standing some way off on the prow, his brow\rwreathed with leaves of cut olive, holds a cup, throws the entrails\rinto the salt waves, and pours out the clear wine.\rA wind, rising astern, follows their departure: his friends\rin rivalry, strike the waves, and sweep the waters.\r\rBKV:779-834 VENUS SEEKS NEPTUNE\xc3\x95S HELP\r\rBut meanwhile Venus, tormented by anxiety speaks\rto Neptune, and pours out her complaints in this manner:\r\xc3\x92O Neptune, Juno\xc3\x95s heavy anger, and her implacable\rheart, force me to descend to every kind of prayer,\rshe whom no length of time nor any piety can move,\rnor does she rest, unwearied by fate or Jove\xc3\x95s commands.\rIt\xc3\x95s not enough that in her wicked hatred she\xc3\x95s consumed a city, \rat the heart of Phrygia, and dragged the survivors of Troy \rthrough extremes of punishment: she pursues the bones and ashes\rof the slaughtered. She alone knows the reason for such fury.\rYou yourself are witness to the trouble she stirred lately\rin Libyan waters: she confused the whole sea\rwith the sky, daring to do this within your realm,\rrelying vainly on Aeolus\xc3\x95s violent storm-winds.\rSee, how, rousing the Trojan women, in her wickedness,\rand disgracefully, she has burnt their fleet, and, with ships lost,\rto leave their friends behind on an unknown shore.\rI beg you to let the rest sail safely through your seas, \rlet them reach Laurentine Tiber, if I ask\rwhat is allowed, if the Fates grant them their city.\xc3\x93\rThen the son of Saturn, the master of the deep oceans,\rsaid this: \xc3\x92You\xc3\x95ve every right to trust in my realms, Cytherea, \rfrom which you draw your own origin. Also I\xc3\x95ve earned it:\rI\xc3\x95ve often controlled the rage and fury of sea and sky.\rNor has my concern been less for your Aeneas on land\r(I call Xanthus and Simois as witnesses). When Achilles\rchased the Trojan ranks, in their panic, forcing them to the wall,\rand sent many thousands to death, and the rivers choked and\rgroaned, and Xanthus could not find his course \ror roll down to the sea, then it was I who caught up Aeneas\rin a thick mist, as he met that brave son of Peleus,\rwhen neither the gods nor his own strength favoured him,\rthough I longed to destroy the walls of lying Troy,\rthat my hands had built, from the ground up.\rNow also my mind remains the same: dispel your fears.\rHe will reach the harbours of Avernus, safely, as you ask.\rThere will only be one, lost in the waves, whom you \rwill look for: one life that will be given for the many.\xc3\x93\rWhen he had soothed the goddess\xc3\x95s heart, she joying at his words,\rFather Neptune yoked his wild horses with gold, set the bits\rin their foaming mouths, and, with both hands, gave them free rein.\rHe sped lightly over the ocean in his sea-green chariot,\rthe waves subsided and the expanse of swollen waters\rgrew calm under the thunderous axle:\rthe storm-clouds vanished from the open sky. \rThen came his multi-formed followers, great whales,\rGlaucus\xc3\x95s aged band, Palaemon Ino\xc3\x95s son,\rthe swift Tritons, and all of Phorcus\xc3\x95s host:\rthe left hand taken by Thetis, Melite and virgin Panopea,\rNesaea, and Spio, Thalia, and Cymodoce.\rAt this, soothing joy in turn pervaded father Aeneas\xc3\x95s \ranxious mind: he ordered all to raise their masts\rquickly, and the sails to be unfurled from the yard-arms.\rTogether they hauled on the ropes and let out the canvas as one,\rnow to port and now to starboard: together they swung \rthe high yards about: benign winds drove the fleet along.\rPalinurus, first of them all, led the close convoy:\rthe rest were ordered to set their course by his.\r\r\rBKV:835-871 THE LOSS OF PALINURUS\r\rAnd now dew-wet Night had just reached her zenith\rin the sky: the sailors relaxed their limbs in quiet rest\rstretched out on the hard benches beneath the oars:\rwhen Sleep, gliding lightly down from the heavenly stars,\rparted the gloomy air, and scattered the shadows, \rseeking you, bringing you dark dreams, Palinurus, \rthough you were innocent: the god settled on the high stern,\rappearing as Phorbas, and poured these words from his mouth:\r\xc3\x92Palinurus, son of Iasus, the seas themselves steer the fleet,\rthe breezes blow steadily, this hour is granted for rest.\rLay down your head and rob your weary eyes of labour.\rFor a little while, I myself will take on your duty for you.\xc3\x93\rPalinurus, barely lifting his gaze, spoke to him:\r\xc3\x92Do you tell me to trust the sea\xc3\x95s placid face, \rthe calm waves? Shall I set my faith on this monster?\rWhy should I entrust Aeneas to the deceptive breeze,\rI whom a clear sky has deceived so often?\xc3\x93\rSo he spoke and clinging hard to the tiller\rnever relaxed his hold, and held his sight on the stars.\rBehold, despite his caution, the god shook a branch, \rwet with Lethe\xc3\x95s dew, soporific with Styx\xc3\x95s power, \rover his brow, and set free his swimming eyes.\rThe first sudden drowse had barely relaxed his limbs,\rwhen Sleep leant above him and threw him headlong\rinto the clear waters, tearing away the tiller \rand part of the stern, he calling to his friends often, in vain:\rwhile the god raised his wings in flight into the empty air.\rThe fleet sailed on its way over the sea, as safely as before,\rgliding on, unaware, as father Neptune had promised.\rAnd now drawn onwards it was close to the Sirens\xc3\x95s cliffs, tricky\rof old, and white with the bones of many men, (now the rocks, \rfar off, boomed loud with the unending breakers) when the leader\rrealised his ship was wallowing adrift, her helmsman lost, \rand he himself steered her through the midnight waters, \rsighing deeply, and shocked at heart by his friend\xc3\x95s fate:\r\xc3\x92Oh, far too trustful of the calm sea, and the sky,\r you\xc3\x95ll lie naked, Palinurus, on an unknown shore.\xc3\x93\r\r\n\r\rBOOK VI\r\r\rBKVI:1-55 THE TEMPLE AT CUMAE\r\rSo Aeneas spoke, weeping, gave his fleet full rein, and glided\rat last to the shores of Euboean Cumae. They turned\rtheir prows to the sea, secured the ships\xc3\x95 anchors,\rby the grip of their flukes, and the curved boats \rlined the beach. The youthful band leapt eagerly\rto the Hesperian shore: some sought the means of fire\rcontained in veins of flint, some raided the woods\rthe dense coverts of game, pointing out streams they found.\rBut pious Aeneas sought the summits, where Apollo \rrules on high, and the vast cavern nearby, the secret place \rof the terrifying Sibyl, in whom the Delian prophet \rinspires greatness of mind and spirit, and reveals the future.\rSoon they entered the grove of Diana, and the golden house.\rDaedalus, so the story goes, fleeing from Minos\xc3\x95s kingdom,\rdared to trust himself to the air on swift wings,\rand, gliding on unknown paths to the frozen North,\rhovered lightly at last above the Chalcidian hill.\rFirst returning to earth here, he dedicated his oar-like wings\rto you Phoebus, and built a gigantic temple.\rOn the doors the Death of Androgeos: then the Athenians,\rCrecrops\xc3\x95s descendants, commanded, sadly, to pay annual tribute\rof seven of their sons: there the urn stands with the lots drawn.\rFacing it, rising from the sea, the Cretan land is depicted:\rand here the bull\xc3\x95s savage passion, Pasiphae\xc3\x95s \rsecret union, and the Minotaur, hybrid offspring,\rthat mixture of species, proof of unnatural relations:\rthe artwork here is that palace, and its inextricable maze:\rand yet Daedalus himself, pitying the noble princess\rAriadne\xc3\x95s love, unravelled the deceptive tangle of corridors,\rguiding Theseus\xc3\x95s blind footsteps with the clue of thread.\rYou\xc3\x95d have shared largely in such a work, Icarus, if grief \rhad allowed, he\xc3\x95d twice attempted to fashion your fate\rin gold, twice your father\xc3\x95s hands fell. Eyes would have read\rthe whole continuously, if Achetes had not arrived \rfrom his errand, with Deiophobe, Glaucus\xc3\x95s daughter,\rthe priestess of Phoebus and Diana, who spoke to the leader:\r\xc3\x94This moment doesn\xc3\x95t require your sightseeing: it would\rbe better to sacrifice seven bullocks from a virgin herd, \rand as many carefully chosen two-year old sheep.\xc3\x95\rHaving spoken to Aeneas in this way (without delay they sacrificed\ras ordered) the priestess called the Trojans to her high shrine.\rThe vast flank of the Euboean cliff is pitted with caves,\rfrom which a hundred wide tunnels, a hundred mouths lead,\rfrom which as many voices rush: the Sibyl\xc3\x95s replies.\rThey had come to the threshold, when the virgin cried out:\r\xc3\x94It is time to question the Oracle, behold, the god, the god!\xc3\x95\rAs she so spoke in front of the doors, suddenly neither her face\rnor colour were the same, nor did her hair remain bound, \rbut her chest heaved, her heart swelled with wild frenzy,\rshe seemed taller, and sounded not-human, for now\rthe power of the god is closer. \xc3\x94Are you slow with your\rvows and prayers, Aeneas of Troy, are you slow?\xc3\x95 \rshe cried. \xc3\x94The great lips of the House of Inspiration \rwill not open without.\xc3\x95 And so saying she fell silent. \rAn icy shudder ran to the Trojans\xc3\x95 very spines,\rand their leader poured out heartfelt prayers:\r\rBKVI:56-97 THE SIBYL\xc3\x95S PROPHECY\r\r\xc3\x94Phoebus, you who always pitied Troy\xc3\x95s intense suffering,\rwho guided the hand of Paris, and the Dardan arrow,\ragainst Achilles\xc3\x95s body, with you as leader I entered\rall those seas, encircling vast lands, and penetrated \rthe remote Massilian tribes and the fields edged by Syrtes:\rnow at last we have the coast of elusive Italy in our grasp:\rTroy\xc3\x95s ill fortune only followed us as far as here.\rYou too with justice can spare the Trojan race, and all you gods\rand goddesses to whom the great glory of Ilium and Dardania \rwas an offence. O most sacred of prophetesses, \ryou who see the future, (I ask for no lands not owed me\rby my destiny) grant that we Trojans may settle Latium,\rwith the exiled gods and storm-tossed powers of Troy.\rThen I\xc3\x95ll dedicate a temple of solid marble to Phoebus\rand Diana Trivia, and sacred days in Phoebus\xc3\x95s name.\rA noble inner shrine waits for you too in our kingdom.\rThere, gracious one, I will place your oracles, and mystic\rutterances spoken to my people, and consecrate picked men.\rOnly do not write your verses on the leaves, lest they fly,\rdisordered playthings of the rushing winds: chant them \rfrom your own mouth.\xc3\x95 He put an end to his mouth\xc3\x95s speaking.\rBut the wild prophetess raged in her cavern, not yet\rsubmitting to Phoebus, as if she might shake the great god \rfrom her spirit: yet he exhausted her raving mouth \rall the more, taming her wild heart, shaping her by constraint.\rAnd now the shrine\xc3\x95s hundred mighty lips have opened\rof themselves, and carry the seer\xc3\x95s answer through the air:\r\xc3\x94Oh, you who are done with all the perils of the sea,\r(yet greater await you on land) the Trojans will come\rto the realm of Lavinium (put that care from your heart):\rbut will not enjoy their coming. War, fierce war,\rI see: and the Tiber foaming with much blood.\rYou will not lack a Simois, a Xanthus, a Greek camp:\reven now another Achilles is born in Latium,\rhe too the son of a goddess: nor will Juno, the Trojans\xc3\x95 bane,\rbe ever far away, while you, humbled and destitute,\rwhat races and cities of Italy will you not beg in!\rOnce again a foreign bride is the cause of all \rthese Trojan ills, once more an alien marriage.\rDo not give way to misfortunes, meet them more bravely,\ras your destiny allows. The path of safety will open up\rfor you from where you least imagine it, a Greek city.\xc3\x95\rBKVI:98-155 AENEAS ASKS ENTRY TO HADES\r\rWith such words, the Sibyl of Cumae chants fearful enigmas, \rfrom her shrine, echoing from the cave,\rtangling truths and mysteries: as she raves, Apollo\rthrashes the reins, and twists the spur under her breast.\rWhen the frenzy quietens, and the mad mouth hushes,\rAeneas, the Hero, begins: \xc3\x94O Virgin, no new, unexpected\rkind of suffering appears: I\xc3\x95ve foreseen them all\rand travelled them before, in my own spirit.\rOne thing I ask: for they say the gate of the King of Darkness\ris here, and the shadowy marsh, Acheron\xc3\x95s overflow:\rlet me have sight of my dear father, his face: show me the way, \ropen wide the sacred doors. I saved him, brought him\rout from the thick of the enemy, through the flames, \ron these shoulders, with a thousand spears behind me:\rcompanion on my journey, he endured with me\rall the seas, all the threats of sky and ocean, weak, \rbeyond his power, and his allotted span of old age.\rHe ordered me, with prayers, to seek you out, humbly, \rand approach your threshold: I ask you, kindly one,\rpity both father and son: since you are all power, not for\rnothing has Hecate set you to rule the groves of Avernus.\rIf Orpheus could summon the shade of his wife,\rrelying on his Thracian lyre, its melodious strings:\rif Pollux, crossing that way, and returning, so often,  \rcould redeem his brother by dying in turn \xc3\x90 and great Theseus,\rwhat of him, or Hercules? \xc3\x90 well, my race too is Jupiter\xc3\x95s on high.\xc3\x95\rWith these words he prayed, and grasped the altar,\ras the priestess began to speak: \xc3\x94Trojan son of Anchises,\rsprung from the blood of the gods, the path to hell is easy:\rblack Dis\xc3\x95s door is open night and day:\rbut to retrace your steps, and go out to the air above,\rthat is work, that is the task. Some sons of the gods have done it,\rwhom favouring Jupiter loved, or whom burning virtue\rlifted to heaven. Woods cover all the middle part,\rand Cocytus is round it, sliding in dark coils.\rBut if such desire is in your mind, such a longing\rto sail the Stygian lake twice, and twice see Tartarus,\rand if it delights you to indulge in insane effort,\rlisten to what you must first undertake. Hidden in a dark tree\ris a golden bough, golden in leaves and pliant stem,\rsacred to Persephone, the underworld\xc3\x95s Juno, all the groves\rshroud it, and shadows enclose the secret valleys.\rBut only one who\xc3\x95s taken a gold-leaved fruit from the tree\ris allowed to enter earth\xc3\x95s hidden places.\rThis lovely Proserpine has commanded to be brought to her\ras a gift: a second fruit of gold never fails to appear \rwhen the first one\xc3\x95s picked, the twig\xc3\x95s leafed with the same metal.\rSo look for it up high, and when you\xc3\x95ve found it with your eyes,\rtake it, of right, in your hand: since, if the Fates have chosen you,\rit will come away easily, freely of itself: otherwise you \rwon\xc3\x95t conquer it by any force, or cut it with the sharpest steel.\rAnd the inanimate body of your friend lies there\r(Ah! You do not know) and taints your whole fleet with death,\rwhile you seek advice and hang about our threshold.\rCarry him first to his place and bury him in the tomb.\rLead black cattle there: let those be your first offerings of atonement.\rOnly then can you look on the Stygian groves, and the realms \rforbidden to the living.\xc3\x95 She spoke and with closed lips fell silent.\r\rBKVI:156-182 THE FINDING OF MISENUS\xc3\x95S BODY\r\rLeaving the cave, Aeneas walked away, \rwith sad face and downcast eyes, turning their dark fate\rover in his mind. Loyal Achates walked at his side \rand fashioned his steps with similar concern. \rThey engaged in intricate discussion between them,\ras to who the dead friend, the body to be interred, was,\rwhom the priestess spoke of. And as they passed along\rthey saw Misenus, ruined by shameful death, on the dry sand,\rMisenus, son of Aeolus, than whom none was more outstanding\rin rousing men with the war-trumpet, kindling conflict with music.\rHe was great Hector\xc3\x95s friend: with Hector \rhe went to battle, distinguished by his spear and trumpet.\rWhen victorious Achilles despoiled Hector of life,\rthis most courageous hero joined the company\rof Trojan Aeneas, serving no lesser a man. But when, \rby chance, he foolishly made the ocean sound\rto a hollow conch-shell, and called gods to compete\rin playing, if the tale can be believed, Triton overheard him\rand drowned him in the foaming waves among the rocks.\rSo, with pious Aeneas to the fore, they all mourned \rround the body with loud clamour. Then, without delay, weeping,\rthey hurried to carry out the Sibyl\xc3\x95s orders, and laboured to pile\rtree-trunks as a funeral pyre, raising it to the heavens.\rThey enter the ancient wood, the deep coverts of wild creatures: \rthe pine-trees fell, the oaks rang to the blows of the axe,\rash trunks and fissile oak were split with wedges, \rand they rolled large rowan trees down from the hills.\r\rBKVI:183-235 THE FUNERAL PYRE\r\rAeneas was no less active in such efforts, encouraging\rhis companions, and employing similar tools.\rAnd he turned things over in his own saddened mind,\rgazing at the immense forest, and by chance prayed so:\r\xc3\x94If only that golden bough would show itself to us\rnow, on some such tree, among the woods! For the prophetess\rspoke truly of you Misenus, alas, only too truly.\xc3\x95\rHe had barely spoken when by chance a pair of doves \rcame flying down from the sky, beneath his very eyes,\rand settled on the green grass. Then the great hero knew \rthey were his mother\xc3\x95s birds, and prayed in his joy:\r\xc3\x94O be my guides, if there is some way, and steer a course\rthrough the air, to that grove where the rich branch\rcasts its shadow on fertile soil. And you mother, O goddess,\rdon\xc3\x95t fail me in time of doubt.\xc3\x95 So saying he halted his footsteps,\robserving what signs the doves might give, and which direction\rthey might take. As they fed they went forward in flight\rjust as far as, following, his eyes could keep them in sight.\rThen, when they reached the foul jaws of stinking Avernus,\rthey quickly rose and, gliding through the clear air,\rperched on the longed-for dual-natured tree, from which\rthe alien gleam of gold shone out, among the branches.\rJust as mistletoe, that does not form a tree of its own,\rgrows in the woods in the cold of winter, with a foreign leaf, \rand surrounds a smooth trunk with yellow berries:\rsuch was the vision of this leafy gold in the dark\roak-tree, so the foil tinkled in the light breeze.\rAeneas immediately plucked it, eagerly breaking the tough\rbough, and carried it to the cave of the Sibylline prophetess.\rMeanwhile, on the shore, the Trojans were weeping bitterly \rfor Misenus and paying their last respects to his senseless ashes.\rFirst they raised a huge pyre, heavy with cut oak and pine,\rweaving the sides with dark foliage, set funereal cypress in front,\rand decorated it above with shining weapons.\rSome heated water, making the cauldrons boil on the flames,\rand washed and anointed the chill corpse. They made lament.\rThen, having wept, they placed his limbs on the couch,\rand threw purple robes over them, his usual dress.\rSome raised the great bier, a sad duty,\rand, with averted faces, set a torch below, \rin ancestral fashion. Gifts were heaped on the flames,\rof incense, foodstuffs, bowls brimming with olive-oil.\rWhen the ashes collapsed, and the blaze died, they washed\rthe remains of the parched bones in wine, and Corynaeus,\rcollecting the fragments, closed them in a bronze urn.\rAlso he circled his comrades three times with pure water\rto purify them, sprinkling fine dew from a full olive branch,\rand spoke the words of parting. And virtuous Aeneas\rheaped up a great mound for his tomb, with the hero\xc3\x95s\rown weapons, his trumpet and oar, beneath a high mountain\rwhich is called Misenus now after him, and preserves\rhis ever-living name throughout the ages.\r\r\rBKVI:236-263 THE SACRIFICE TO HECATE\r\rThis done, he quickly carried out the Sibyl\xc3\x95s orders.\rThere was a deep stony cave, huge and gaping wide,\rsheltered by a dark lake and shadowy woods,\rover which nothing could extend its wings in safe flight,\rsince such a breath flowed from those black jaws, \rand was carried to the over-arching sky, that the Greeks \rcalled it by the name Aornos, that is Avernus, or the Bird-less.\rHere the priestess first of all tethered four black heifers,\rpoured wine over their foreheads, and placed \rthe topmost bristles that she plucked, growing\rbetween their horns, in the sacred fire, as a first offering,\rcalling aloud to Hecate, powerful in Heaven and Hell.\rOthers slit the victim\xc3\x95s throats and caught the warm blood\rin bowls. Aeneas himself sacrificed a black-fleeced lamb\rto Night, mother of the Furies, and Earth, her mighty sister,\rand a barren heifer to you, Persephone.\rThen he kindled the midnight altars for the Stygian King,\rand placed whole carcasses of bulls on the flames,\rpouring rich oil over the blazing entrails.\rSee now, at the dawn light of the rising sun,\rthe ground bellowed under their feet, the wooded hills began\rto move, and, at the coming of the Goddess, dogs seemed to howl\rin the shadows. \xc3\x94Away, stand far away, O you profane ones,\xc3\x95\rthe priestess cried, \xc3\x94absent yourselves from all this grove:\rand you now, Aeneas, be on your way, and tear your sword\rfrom the sheathe: you need courage, and a firm mind, now.\xc3\x95\rSo saying, she plunged wildly into the open cave:\rhe, fearlessly, kept pace with his vanishing guide.\r\rBKVI:264-294 THE ENTRANCE TO HADES\r \rYou gods, whose is the realm of spirits, and you, dumb shadows,\rand Chaos, Phlegethon, wide silent places of the night, \rlet me tell what I have heard: by your power, let me \rreveal things buried in the deep earth, and the darkness.\rOn they went, hidden in solitary night, through gloom,\rthrough Dis\xc3\x95s empty halls, and insubstantial kingdom,\rlike a path through a wood, in the faint light \runder a wavering moon, when Jupiter has buried the sky\rin shadow, and black night has stolen the colour from things.\rRight before the entrance, in the very jaws of Orcus,\rGrief and vengeful Care have made their beds,\rand pallid Sickness lives there, and sad Old Age,\rand Fear, and persuasive Hunger, and vile Need,\rforms terrible to look on, and Death and Pain:\rthen Death\xc3\x95s brother Sleep, and Evil Pleasure of the mind,\rand, on the threshold opposite, death-dealing War,\rand the steel chambers of the Furies, and mad Discord,\rher snaky hair entwined with blood-wet ribbons.\rIn the centre a vast shadowy elm spreads its aged trunks\rand branches: the seat, they say, that false Dreams hold,\rthronging, clinging beneath every leaf.\rAnd many other monstrous shapes of varied creatures,\rare stabled by the doors, Centaurs and bi-formed Scylla,\rand hundred-armed Briareus, and the Lernean Hydra,\rhissing fiercely, and the Chimaera armed with flame,\rGorgons, and Harpies, and the triple bodied shade, Geryon.\rAt this, trembling suddenly with terror, Aeneas grasped \rhis sword, and set the naked blade against their approach:\rand, if his knowing companion had not warned him\rthat these were tenuous bodiless lives flitting about\rwith a hollow semblance of form, he would have rushed at them,\rand hacked at the shadows uselessly with his sword.\r\rBKVI:295-336 THE SHORES OF ACHERON\r\rFrom here there is a road that leads to the waters \rof Tartarean Acheron. Here thick with mud a whirlpool seethes \rin the vast depths, and spews all its sands into Cocytus.\rA grim ferryman watches over the rivers and streams,\rCharon, dreadful in his squalor, with a mass of unkempt\rwhite hair straggling from his chin: flames glow in his eyes,\ra dirty garment hangs, knotted from his shoulders.\rHe poles the boat and trims the sails himself,\rand ferries the dead in his dark skiff,\rold now, but a god\xc3\x95s old age is fresh and green.\rHere all the crowd streams, hurrying to the shores,\rwomen and men, the lifeless bodies of noble heroes,\rboys and unmarried girls, sons laid on the pyre\rin front of their father\xc3\x95s eyes: as many as the leaves that fall\rin the woods at the first frost of autumn, as many as the birds\rthat flock to land from ocean deeps, when the cold of the year\rdrives them abroad and despatches them to sunnier countries.\rThey stood there, pleading to be first to make the crossing,\rstretching out their hands in longing for the far shore.\rBut the dismal boatman accepts now these, now those,\rbut driving others away, keeps them far from the sand.\rThen Aeneas, stirred and astonished at the tumult, said: \r\xc3\x94O virgin, tell me, what does this crowding to the river mean?\rWhat do the souls want? And by what criterion do these leave\rthe bank, and those sweep off with the oars on the leaden stream?\rThe ancient priestess spoke briefly to him, so:\r\xc3\x94Son of Anchises, true child of the gods, you see \rthe deep pools of Cocytus, and the Marsh of Styx,\rby whose name the gods fear to swear falsely.\rAll this crowd, you see, were destitute and unburied:\rthat ferryman is Charon: those the waves carry were buried:\rhe may not carry them from the fearful shore on the harsh waters\rbefore their bones are at rest in the earth. They roam\rfor a hundred years and flit around these shores: only then\rare they admitted, and revisit the pools they long for.\xc3\x95\rThe son of Anchises halted, and checked his footsteps,\rthinking deeply, and pitying their sad fate in his heart.\rHe saw Leucaspis and Orontes, captain of the Lycian fleet,\rthere, grieving and lacking honour in death, whom a Southerly\roverwhelmed, as they sailed together from Troy on the windswept \rwaters, engulfing both the ship and crew in the waves.\r\rBKVI:337-383 THE SHADE OF PALINURUS\r\rBehold, there came the helmsman, Palinurus, \rwho fell from the stern on the Libyan passage,\rflung into the midst of the waves, as he watched the stars.\rWhen Aeneas had recognised him with difficulty\rsorrowing among the deep shadows, he spoke first, saying:\r\xc3\x94What god tore you from us, Palinurus, and drowned you \rmid-ocean? For in this one prophecy Apollo has misled me,\rhe whom I never found false before, he said that you would be safe\rat sea and reach Ausonia\xc3\x95s shores. Is this the truth of his promise?\xc3\x95 \rBut he replied: \xc3\x94Phoebus\xc3\x95s tripod did not fail you, Aeneas,\rmy captain, nor did a god drown me in the deep.\rBy chance the helm was torn from me with violence,\ras I clung there, on duty as ordered, steering our course,\rand I dragged it headlong with me. I swear by the cruel sea\rthat I feared less for myself than for your ship,\rlest robbed of its gear, and cleared of its helmsman,\rit might founder among such surging waves.\rThe Southerly drove me violently through the vast seas\rfor three stormy nights: high on the crest of a wave,\rin the fourth dawn, I could just make out Italy.\rGradually I swam to shore: grasped now at safety,\rbut as I caught at the sharp tips of the rocks, weighed down\rby my water-soaked clothes, the savage people\rattacked me with knives, ignorantly thinking me a prize.\rNow the waves have me, and the winds roll me along the shore.\rUnconquered one, I beg you, by the sweet light and air of heaven,\rby your father, and your hopes in Iulus to come,\rsave me from this evil: either find Velia\xc3\x95s harbour again\r(for you can) and sprinkle earth on me, or if there is some way,\rif your divine mother shows you one (since you\xc3\x95d not attempt to sail\rsuch waters, and the Stygian marsh, without a god\xc3\x95s will, I think)\rthen give this wretch your hand and take me with you through the waves\rthat at least I might rest in some quiet place in death.\xc3\x95\rSo he spoke, and the priestess began to reply like this:\r\xc3\x94Where does this dire longing of yours come from, O Palinurus?\rCan you see the Stygian waters, unburied, or the grim \rriver of the Furies, Cocytus, or come unasked to the shore?\rCease to hope that divine fate can be tempered by prayer.\rBut hold my words in your memory, as a comfort in your hardship: \rthe nearby peoples, from cities far and wide, will be moved \rby divine omens to worship your bones, and build a tomb, \rand send offerings to the tomb, and the place will have\rPalinurus as its everlasting name.\xc3\x95 His anxiety was quelled \rby her words, and, for a little while, grief was banished \rfrom his sad heart: he delighted in the land being so named.\r\rBKVI:384-416 CHARON THE FERRYMAN\r \rSo they pursued their former journey, and drew near the river.\rNow when the Boatman saw them from the Stygian wave\rwalking through the silent wood, and directing their footsteps\rtowards its bank, he attacked them verbally, first, and unprompted,\rrebuking them: \xc3\x94Whoever you are, who come armed to my river,\rtell me, from over there, why you\xc3\x95re here, and halt your steps.\rThis is a place of shadows, of Sleep and drowsy Night:\rI\xc3\x95m not allowed to carry living bodies in the Stygian boat.\rTruly it was no pleasure for me to take Hercules on his journey\rover the lake, nor Theseus and Pirithous, though they may\rhave been children of gods, unrivalled in strength.\rThe first came for Cerberus the watchdog of Tartarus,\rand dragged him away quivering from under the king\xc3\x95s throne:\rthe others were after snatching our Queen from Dis\xc3\x95s chamber.\xc3\x95\rTo this the prophetess of Amphrysian Apollo briefly answered:\r\xc3\x94There\xc3\x95s no such trickery here (don\xc3\x95t be disturbed),\rour weapons offer no affront: your huge guard-dog \rcan terrify the bloodless shades with his eternal howling:\rchaste Proserpine can keep to her uncle\xc3\x95s threshold.\rAeneas the Trojan, renowned in piety and warfare,\rgoes down to the deepest shadows of Erebus, to his father.\rIf the idea of such affection does not move you, still you \rmust recognise this bough.\xc3\x95 (She showed the branch, hidden \rin her robes.) Then the anger in his swollen breast subsided. \rNo more was said. Marvelling at the revered offering,\rof fateful twigs, seen again after so long, he turned the stern\rof the dark skiff towards them and neared the bank. \rThen he turned off the other souls who sat on the long benches,\rcleared the gangways: and received mighty Aeneas \ron board. The seamed skiff groaned with the weight\rand let in quantities of marsh-water through the chinks.\rAt last, the river crossed, he landed the prophetess and the hero\rsafe, on the unstable mud, among the blue-grey sedge.\r\rBKVI:417-439 BEYOND THE ACHERON\r\rHuge Cerberus sets these regions echoing with his triple-throated \rhowling, crouching monstrously in a cave opposite.\rSeeing the snakes rearing round his neck, the prophetess\rthrew him a pellet, a soporific of honey and drugged wheat.\rOpening his three throats, in rabid hunger, he seized \rwhat she threw and, flexing his massive spine, sank to earth \rspreading his giant bulk over the whole cave-floor.\rWith the guard unconscious Aeneas won to the entrance,\rand quickly escaped the bank of the river of no return.\rImmediately a loud crying of voices was heard, the spirits\rof weeping infants, whom a dark day stole at the first\rthreshold of this sweet life, those chosen to be torn \rfrom the breast, and drowned in bitter death.\rNearby are those condemned to die on false charges.\rYet their place is not ordained without the allotted jury:\rMinos, the judge, shakes the urn: he convenes the voiceless court,\rand hears their lives and sins. Then the next place \ris held by those gloomy spirits who, innocent of crime, \rdied by their own hand, and, hating the light, threw away\rtheir lives. How willingly now they\xc3\x95d endure\rpoverty and harsh suffering, in the air above!\rDivine Law prevents it, and the sad marsh and its hateful\rwaters binds them, and nine-fold Styx confines them.\r\r\r\r\r\r\rTorments of Hell, Carl Ludwig Beutler (Germany, 1638 - 1683)\rYale University Art Gallery\r\r\n\rBKVI:440-476 THE SHADE OF DIDO\r\rNot far from there the Fields of Mourning are revealed,\rspread out on all sides: so they name them.\rThere, those whom harsh love devours with cruel pining\rare concealed in secret walkways, encircled by a myrtle grove:\reven in death their troubles do not leave them.\rHere Aeneas saw Phaedra, and Procris, and sad Eriphyle,\rdisplaying the wounds made by her cruel son,\rEvadne, and Pasiphae: with them walked Laodamia,\rand Caeneus, now a woman, once a young man,\rreturned by her fate to her own form again.\rAmong them Phoenician Dido wandered, in the great wood,\rher wound still fresh. As soon as the Trojan hero stood near her\rand knew her, shadowy among the shadows, like a man who sees,\ror thinks he sees, the new moon rising through a cloud, as its month \rbegins, he wept tears and spoke to her with tender affection:\r\xc3\x94Dido, unhappy spirit, was the news that came to me \rof your death, true then, taking your life with a blade? \rAlas, was I the cause of your dying? I swear by the stars, \rby the gods above, by whatever truth may be in the depths\rof the earth, I left your shores unwillingly, my queen.\rI was commanded by gods, who drove me by their decrees,\rthat now force me to go among the shades, through places\rthorny with neglect, and deepest night: nor did I think \rmy leaving there would ever bring such grief to you.\rHalt your footsteps and do not take yourself from my sight. \rWhat do you flee? This is the last speech with you that fate allows.\xc3\x95\rWith such words Aeneas would have calmed\rher fiery spirit and wild looks, and provoked her tears.\rShe turned away, her eyes fixed on the ground,\rno more altered in expression by the speech he had begun\rthan if hard flint stood there, or a cliff of Parian marble.\rAt the last she tore herself away, and, hostile to him,\rfled to the shadowy grove where Sychaeus, her husband\rin former times, responded to her suffering, and gave her\rlove for love. Aeneas, no less shaken by the injustice of fate,\rfollowed her, far off, with his tears, and pitied her as she went.\r\rBKVI:477-534 THE SHADE OF DEIPHOBUS\r\rFrom there he laboured on the way that was granted them. \rAnd soon they reached the most distant fields,\rthe remote places where those famous in war\rcrowd together. Here Tydeus met him, Parthenopaeus\rglorious in arms, and the pale form of Adrastus:\rhere were the Trojans, wept for deeply above, fallen in war,\rwhom, seeing them all in their long ranks, he groaned at,\rGlaucus, Medon and Thersilochus, the three sons of Antenor,\rPolyboetes, the priest of Ceres, and Idaeus\rstill with his chariot, and his weapons. \rThe spirits stand there in crowds to left and right.\rThey are not satisfied with seeing him only once:\rthey delight in lingering on, walking beside him,\rand learning the reason for his coming.\rBut the Greek princes and Agamemnon\xc3\x95s phalanxes,\rtrembled with great fear, when they saw the hero,\rand his gleaming weapons, among the shades:\rsome turned to run, as they once sought their ships: some raised\ra faint cry, the noise they made belying their gaping mouths.\rAnd he saw Deiphobus there, Priam\xc3\x95s son, his whole body\rmutilated, his face brutally torn, his face and hands both, the ears\rripped from his ruined head, his nostrils sheared by an ugly wound.\rIndeed Aeneas barely recognised the quivering form, hiding its dire\rpunishment, even as he called to him, unprompted, in familiar tones: \r\xc3\x94Deiphobus, powerful in war, born of Teucer\xc3\x95s noble blood,\rwho chose to work such brutal punishment on you?\rWho was allowed to treat you so? Rumour has it \rthat on that final night, wearied by endless killing of Greeks,\ryou sank down on a pile of the slaughtered.\rThen I set up an empty tomb on the Rhoetean shore,\rand called on your spirit three times in a loud voice.\rYour name and weapons watch over the site: I could not \rsee you, friend, to set you, as I left, in your native soil.\xc3\x95\rTo this Priam\xc3\x95s son replied: \xc3\x94O my friend, you\xc3\x95ve neglected\rnothing: you\xc3\x95ve paid all that\xc3\x95s due to Deiophobus\rand a dead man\xc3\x95s spirit. My own destiny, \rand that Spartan woman\xc3\x95s deadly crime, drowned me\rin these sorrows: she left me these memorials.\rYou know how we passed that last night in illusory joy:\rand you must remember it only too well.\rWhen the fateful Horse came leaping the walls of Troy,\rpregnant with the armed warriors it carried in its womb,\rshe led the Trojan women about, wailing in dance,\raping the Bacchic rites: she held a huge torch in their midst,\rsignalling to the Greeks from the heights of the citadel.\rI was then in our unlucky marriage-chamber, worn out with care,\rand heavy with sleep, a sweet deep slumber weighing on me\ras I lay there, the very semblance of peaceful death.\rMeanwhile that illustrious wife of mine removed every weapon\rfrom the house, even stealing my faithful sword from under my head:\rshe calls Menelaus into the house and throws open the doors,\rhoping I suppose it would prove a great gift for her lover,\rand in that way the infamy of her past sins might be erased.\rWhy drag out the tale? They burst into the room, and with them\rUlysses the Aeolid, their co-inciter to wickedness. Gods, so repay\rthe Greeks, if these lips I pray for vengeance with are virtuous. \rBut you, in turn, tell what fate has brought you here, living.\rDo you come here, driven by your wandering on the sea,\ror exhorted by the gods? If not, what misfortune torments you,\rthat you enter these sad sunless houses, this troubled place?\xc3\x95\r\rBKVI:535-627 THE SIBYL DESCRIBES TARTARUS\r\rWhile they spoke Aurora and her rosy chariot had passed \rthe zenith of her ethereal path, and they might perhaps\rhave spent all the time allowed in such talk, but the Sibyl,\rhis companion, warned him briefly saying: \r\xc3\x94Night approaches, Aeneas: we waste the hours with weeping.\rThis is the place where the path splits itself in two:\rthere on the right is our road to Elysium, that runs beneath\rthe walls of mighty Dis: but the left works punishment\ron the wicked, and sends them on to godless Tartarus.\xc3\x95\rDeiophobus replied: \xc3\x94Do not be angry, great priestess:\rI will leave: I will make up the numbers, and return to the darkness.\rGo now glory of our race: enjoy a better fate.\xc3\x95\rSo he spoke, and in speaking turned away.\rAeneas suddenly looked back, and, below the left hand cliff,\rhe saw wide battlements, surrounded by a triple wall,\rand encircled by a swift river of red-hot flames,\rthe Tartarean Phlegethon, churning with echoing rocks.\rA gate fronts it, vast, with pillars of solid steel,\rthat no human force, not the heavenly gods themselves,\rcan overturn by war: an iron tower rises into the air,\rand seated before it, Tisiphone, clothed in a blood-wet dress,\rkeeps guard of the doorway, sleeplessly, night and day.\rGroans came from there, and the cruel sound of the lash,\rthen the clank of iron, and dragging chains.\rAeneas halted, and stood rooted, terrified by the noise.\r\xc3\x94What evil is practised here? O Virgin, tell me: by what torments\rare they oppressed? Why are there such sounds in the air?\xc3\x95\rThen the prophetess began to speak as follows: \xc3\x94Famous leader\rof the Trojans, it is forbidden for the pure to cross the evil threshold:\rbut when Hecate appointed me to the wood of Avernus,\rshe taught me the divine torments, and guided me through them all.\rCretan Rhadamanthus rules this harshest of kingdoms,\rand hears their guilt, extracts confessions, and punishes \rwhoever has deferred atonement for their sins too long\rtill death, delighting in useless concealment, in the world above.\rTisiphone the avenger, armed with her whip, leaps on the guilty immediately,\rlashes them, and threatening them with the fierce\rsnakes in her left hand, calls to her savage troop of sisters.\rThen at last the accursed doors open, screeching on jarring hinges. \rYou comprehend what guardian sits at the door, what shape watches \rthe threshold? Well still fiercer is the monstrous Hydra inside, \rwith her fifty black gaping jaws. There Tartarus itself \rfalls sheer, and stretches down into the darkness:\rtwice as far as we gaze upwards to heavenly Olympus.\rHere the Titanic race, the ancient sons of Earth,\rhurled down by the lightning-bolt, writhe in the depths.\rAnd here I saw the two sons of Aloeus, giant forms,\rwho tried to tear down the heavens with their hands,\rand topple Jupiter from his high kingdom.\rAnd I saw Salmoneus paying a savage penalty\rfor imitating Jove\xc3\x95s lightning, and the Olympian thunder.\rBrandishing a torch, and drawn by four horses\rhe rode in triumph among the Greeks, through Elis\xc3\x95s city,\rclaiming the gods\xc3\x95 honours as his own, a fool,\rwho mimicked the storm-clouds and the inimitable thunderbolt\rwith bronze cymbals and the sound of horses\xc3\x95 hoof-beats.\rBut the all-powerful father hurled his lighting from dense cloud,\rnot for him fiery torches, or pine-branches\xc3\x95 smoky light\rand drove him headlong with the mighty whirlwind.\rAnd Tityus was to be seen as well, the foster-child\rof Earth, our universal mother, whose body stretches\rover nine acres, and a great vulture with hooked beak\rfeeds on his indestructible liver, and his entrails ripe\rfor punishment, lodged deep inside the chest, groping \rfor his feast, no respite given to the ever-renewing tissue.\rShall I speak of the Lapiths, Ixion, Pirithous,\rover whom hangs a dark crag that seems to slip and fall?\rHigh couches for their feast gleam with golden frames,\rand a banquet of royal luxury is spread before their eyes: \rnearby the eldest Fury, crouching, prevents their fingers touching\rthe table: rising up, and brandishing her torch, with a voice of thunder.\rHere are those who hated their brothers, in life, \ror struck a parent, or contrived to defraud a client, \ror who crouched alone over the riches they\xc3\x95d made,\rwithout setting any aside for their kin (their crowd is largest),\rthose who were killed for adultery, or pursued civil war,\rnot fearing to break their pledges to their masters:\rshut in they see their punishment. Don\xc3\x95t ask to know\rthat punishment, or what kind of suffering drowns them.\rSome roll huge stones, or hang spread-eagled \ron wheel-spokes: wretched Theseus sits still, and will sit\rfor eternity: Phlegyas, the most unfortunate, warns them all\rand bears witness in a loud voice among the shades:\r\xc3\x92Learn justice: be warned, and don\xc3\x95t despise the gods.\xc3\x93\rHere\xc3\x95s one who sold his country for gold, and set up\ra despotic lord: this one made law and remade it for a price:\rhe entered his daughter\xc3\x95s bed and a forbidden marriage:\rall of them dared monstrous sin, and did what they dared.\rNot if I had a hundred tongues, a hundred mouths,\ra voice of iron, could I tell all the forms of wickedness\ror spell out the names of every torment.\xc3\x95\r\rBKVI:628-678 THE FIELDS OF ELYSIUM\r\rWhen she had spoken of this, the aged priestess of Apollo said:\r\xc3\x94But come now, travel the road, and complete the task set for you:\rlet us hurry, I see the battlements that were forged \rin the Cyclopean fires, and the gates in the arch opposite us\rwhere we are told to set down the gifts as ordered.\xc3\x95\rShe spoke and keeping step they hastened along the dark path\rcrossing the space between and arriving near the doors.\rAeneas gained the entrance, sprinkled fresh water\rover his body, and set up the branch on the threshold before him.\rHaving at last achieved this, the goddess\xc3\x95s task fulfilled,\rthey came to the pleasant places, the delightful grassy turf\rof the Fortunate Groves, and the homes of the blessed.\rHere freer air and radiant light clothe the plain,\rand these have their own sun, and their own stars.\rSome exercise their bodies in a grassy gymnasium,\rcompete in sports and wrestle on the yellow sand:\rothers tread out the steps of a dance, and sing songs.\rThere Orpheus too, the long-robed priest of Thrace,\raccompanies their voices with the seven-note scale,\rplaying now with fingers, now with the ivory quill.\rHere are Teucer\xc3\x95s ancient people, loveliest of children,\rgreat-hearted heroes, born in happier years,\rIlus, Assaracus, and Dardanus founder of Troy.\rAeneas marvels from a distance at their idle chariots\rand their weapons: their spears fixed in the ground,\rand their horses scattered freely browsing over the plain:\rthe pleasure they took in chariots and armour while alive,\rthe care in tending shining horses, follows them below the earth.\rLook, he sees others on the grass to right and left, feasting, \rand singing a joyful paean in chorus, among the fragrant \rgroves of laurel, out of which the Eridanus\xc3\x95s broad river \rflows through the woodlands to the world above.\rHere is the company of those who suffered wounds fighting\rfor their country: and those who were pure priests, while they lived, \rand those who were faithful poets, singers worthy of Apollo, \rand those who improved life, with discoveries in Art or Science,\rand those who by merit caused others to remember them:\rthe brows of all these were bound with white headbands.\rAs they crowded round, the Sibyl addressed them,\rMusaeus above all: since he holds the centre of the vast crowd, \rall looking up to him, his tall shoulders towering above:\r\xc3\x94Blessed spirits, and you, greatest of Poets, \rsay what region or place contains Anchises. We have \rcome here, crossing the great rivers of Erebus, for him.\xc3\x95\rAnd the hero replied to her briefly in these words:\r\xc3\x94None of us have a fixed abode: we live in the shadowy woods,\rand make couches of river-banks, and inhabit fresh-water meadows.\rBut climb this ridge, if your hearts-wish so inclines,\rand I will soon set you on an easy path.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke and went on before them, and showed them\rthe bright plains below: then they left the mountain heights.\r\rBKVI:679-702 THE MEETING WITH ANCHISES\r\rBut deep in a green valley his father Anchises \rwas surveying the spirits enclosed there, destined\rfor the light above, thinking carefully, and was reviewing\ras it chanced the numbers of his own folk, his dear grandsons,\rand their fate and fortunes as men, and their ways and works.\rAnd when he saw Aeneas heading towards him over the grass\rhe stretched out both his hands eagerly, his face\rstreaming with tears, and a cry issued from his lips:\r\xc3\x94Have you come at last, and has the loyalty your father expected\rconquered the harsh road? Is it granted me to see your face, \rmy son, and hear and speak in familiar tones?\rI calculated it in my mind, and thought it would be so,\rcounting off the hours, nor has my trouble failed me.\rFrom travel over what lands and seas, do I receive you!\rWhat dangers have hurled you about, my son!\rHow I feared the realms of Libya might harm you!\xc3\x95\rHe answered: \xc3\x94Father, your image, yours, appearing to me\rso often, drove me to reach this threshold:\rMy ships ride the Etruscan waves. Father, let me clasp\ryour hand, let me, and do not draw away from my embrace.\xc3\x95\rSo speaking, his face was also drowned in a flood of tears.\rThree times he tries to throw his arms round his father\xc3\x95s neck,\rthree times, clasped in vain, that semblance slips though his hands,\rlike the light breeze, most of all like a winged dream.\r\rBKVI:703-723 THE SOULS DUE FOR RE-BIRTH\r\rAnd now Aeneas saw a secluded grove \rin a receding valley, with rustling woodland thickets,\rand the river of Lethe gliding past those peaceful places.\rInnumerable tribes and peoples hovered round it:\rjust as, in the meadows, on a cloudless summer\xc3\x95s day, \rthe bees settle on the multifarious flowers, and stream\rround the bright lilies, and all the fields hum with their buzzing.\rAeneas was thrilled by the sudden sight, and, in ignorance,\rasked the cause: what the river is in the distance,\rwho the men are crowding the banks in such numbers.\rThen his father Anchises answered: \xc3\x94They are spirits, \rowed a second body by destiny, and they drink\rthe happy waters, and a last forgetting, at Lethe\xc3\x95s stream.\rIndeed, for a long time I\xc3\x95ve wished to tell you of them,\rand show you them face to face, to enumerate my children\xc3\x95s\rdescendants, so you might joy with me more at finding Italy.\xc3\x95\r\xc3\x94O father, is it to be thought that any spirits go from here\rto the sky above, returning again to dull matter?\xc3\x95\r\xc3\x94Indeed I\xc3\x95ll tell you, son, not keep you in doubt,\xc3\x95\rAnchises answered, and revealed each thing in order.\r\rBKVI:724-751 THE TRANSMIGRATION OF SOULS\r\r\xc3\x94Firstly, a spirit within them nourishes the sky and earth,\rthe watery plains, the shining orb of the moon, \rand Titan\xc3\x95s star, and Mind, flowing through matter,\rvivifies the whole mass, and mingles with its vast frame.\rFrom it come the species of man and beast, and winged lives,\rand the monsters the sea contains beneath its marbled waves.\rThe power of those seeds is fiery, and their origin divine,\rso long as harmful matter doesn\xc3\x95t impede them\rand terrestrial bodies and mortal limbs don\xc3\x95t dull them.\rThrough those they fear and desire, and grieve and joy,\rand enclosed in night and a dark dungeon, can\xc3\x95t see the light.\rWhy, when life leaves them at the final hour,\rstill all of the evil, all the plagues of the flesh, alas,\rhave not completely vanished, and many things, long hardened\rdeep within, must of necessity be ingrained, in strange ways.\rSo they are scourged by torments, and pay the price \rfor former sins: some are hung, stretched out, \rto the hollow winds, the taint of wickedness is cleansed\rfor others in vast gulfs, or burned away with fire:\reach spirit suffers its own: then we are sent\rthrough wide Elysium, and we few stay in the joyous fields,\rfor a length of days, till the cycle of time, \rcomplete, removes the hardened stain, and leaves \rpure ethereal thought, and the brightness of natural air.\rAll these others the god calls in a great crowd to the river Lethe,\rafter they have turned the wheel for a thousand years, \rso that, truly forgetting, they can revisit the vault above,\rand begin with a desire to return to the flesh.\xc3\x95\r\rBKVI:752-776 THE FUTURE RACE \xc3\x90 THE ALBAN KINGS\r\rAnchises had spoken, and he drew the Sibyl and his son, both\rtogether, into the middle of the gathering and the murmuring crowd,\rand chose a hill from which he could see all the long ranks \ropposite, and watch their faces as they came by him.\r\xc3\x94Come, I will now explain what glory will pursue the children\rof Dardanus, what descendants await you of the Italian race,\rillustrious spirits to march onwards in our name, and I will teach\ryou your destiny. See that boy, who leans on a headless spear,\rhe is fated to hold a place nearest the light, first to rise \rto the upper air, sharing Italian blood, Silvius, of Alban name,\ryour last-born son, who your wife Lavinia, late in your old age,\rwill give birth to in the wood, a king and the father of kings,\rthrough whom our race will rule in Alba Longa.\rNext to him is Procas, glory of the Trojan people,\rand Capys and Numitor, and he who\xc3\x95ll revive your name,\rSilvius Aeneas, outstanding like you in virtue and arms,\rif he might at last achieve the Alban throne. \rWhat men! See what authority they display, \rtheir foreheads shaded by the civic oak-leaf crown!\rThey will build Nomentum, Gabii, and Fidenae\xc3\x95s city:\rCollatia\xc3\x95s fortress in the hills, Pometii \rand the Fort of Inus, and Bola, and Cora.\rThose will be names that are now nameless land.\r\rBKVI:777-807 THE FUTURE RACE \xc3\x90 ROMULUS AND THE CAESARS\r\rYes, and a child of Mars will join his grandfather to accompany him,\rRomulus, whom his mother Ilia will bear, of Assaracus\xc3\x95s line. \rSee how Mars\xc3\x95s twin plumes stand on his crest, and his father \rmarks him out for the world above with his own emblems?\rBehold, my son, under his command glorious Rome \rwill match earth\xc3\x95s power and heaven\xc3\x95s will, and encircle \rseven hills with a single wall, happy in her race of men: \ras Cybele, the Berecynthian \xc3\x94Great Mother\xc3\x95, crowned \rwith turrets, rides through the Phrygian cities, delighting\rin her divine children, clasping a hundred descendants, \rall gods, all dwelling in the heights above.\rNow direct your eyes here, gaze at this people,\ryour own Romans. Here is Caesar, and all the offspring\rof Iulus destined to live under the pole of heaven.\rThis is the man, this is him, whom you so often hear\rpromised you, Augustus Caesar, son of the Deified, \rwho will make a Golden Age again in the fields\rwhere Saturn once reigned, and extend the empire beyond\rthe Libyans and the Indians (to a land that lies outside the zodiac\xc3\x95s belt,\rbeyond the sun\xc3\x95s ecliptic and the year\xc3\x95s, where sky-carrying Atlas\rturns the sphere, inset with gleaming stars, on his shoulders):\rEven now the Caspian realms, and Maeotian earth, \rtremble at divine prophecies of his coming, and \rthe restless mouths of the seven-branched Nile are troubled.\rTruly, Hercules never crossed so much of the earth,\rthough he shot the bronze-footed Arcadian deer, brought peace\rto the woods of Erymanthus, made Lerna tremble at his bow:\rnor did Bacchus, who steers his chariot, in triumph, with reins \rmade of vines, guiding his tigers down from Nysa\xc3\x95s high peak.\rDo we really hesitate still to extend our power by our actions,\rand does fear prevent us settling the Italian lands? \r\rBKVI:808-853 THE FUTURE RACE \xc3\x90 REPUBLIC AND BEYOND\r\rWho is he, though, over there, distinguished by his olive branches,\rcarrying offerings? I know the hair and the white-bearded chin\rof a king of Rome, Numa, called to supreme authority \rfrom little Cures\xc3\x95s poverty-stricken earth, who will secure\rour first city under the rule of law. Then Tullus \rwill succeed him who will shatter the country\xc3\x95s peace, \rand call to arms sedentary men, ranks now unused to triumphs.\rThe over-boastful Ancus follows him closely, \rdelighting too much even now in the people\xc3\x95s opinion.\rWill you look too at Tarquin\xc3\x95s dynasty, and the proud spirit\rof Brutus the avenger, the rods of office reclaimed?\rHe\xc3\x95ll be the first to win a consul\xc3\x95s powers and the savage axes,\rand when the sons foment a new civil war, the father\rwill call them to account, for lovely freedom\xc3\x95s sake:\rah, to be pitied, whatever posterity says of his actions:\rhis love of country will prevail, and great appetite for glory. \rAh, see over there, the Decii and Drusi, and Torquatus\rbrutal with the axe, and Camillus rescuing the standards.\rBut those others, you can discern, shining in matching armour,\rsouls in harmony now, while they are cloaked in darkness,\rah, if they reach the light of the living, what civil war\rwhat battle and slaughter, they\xc3\x95ll cause, Julius Caesar,\rthe father-in-law, down from the Alpine ramparts, from the fortress\rof Monoecus: Pompey, the son-in-law, opposing with Eastern forces.\rMy sons, don\xc3\x95t inure your spirits to such wars,\rnever turn the powerful forces of your country on itself:\rYou be the first to halt, you, who derive your race from heaven:\rhurl the sword from your hand, who are of my blood!\rThere\xc3\x95s Mummius: triumphing over Corinth, he\xc3\x95ll drive his chariot,\rvictorious, to the high Capitol, famed for the Greeks he\xc3\x95s killed:\rand Aemilius Paulus, who, avenging his Trojan ancestors, and Minerva\xc3\x95s\rdesecrated shrine, will destroy Agamemnon\xc3\x95s Mycenae, and Argos, \rand Perseus the Aeacid himself, descendant of war-mighty Achilles.\rWho would pass over you in silence, great Cato, or you Cossus,\ror the Gracchus\xc3\x95s race, or the two Scipios, war\xc3\x95s lightning bolts,\rthe scourges of Libya, or you Fabricius, powerful in poverty,\ror you, Regulus Serranus, sowing your furrow with seed?\rFabii, where do you hurry my weary steps? You, Fabius \rMaximus, the Delayer, are he who alone renew our State.\rOthers (I can well believe) will hammer out bronze that breathes\rwith more delicacy than us, draw out living features \rfrom the marble: plead their causes better, trace with instruments\rthe movement of the skies, and tell the rising of the constellations:\rremember, Roman, it is for you to rule the nations with your power,\r(that will be your skill) to crown peace with law,\rto spare the conquered, and subdue the proud.\xc3\x95\rBKVI:854-885 THE FUTURE RACE \xc3\x90 MARCELLUS\r\rSo father Anchises spoke, and while they marvelled, added:\r\xc3\x94See, how Claudius Marcellus, distinguished by the Supreme Prize,\rcomes forward, and towers, victorious, over other men.\rAs a knight, he\xc3\x95ll support the Roman State, turbulent\rwith fierce confusion, strike the Cathaginians and rebellious Gauls,\rand dedicate captured weapons, a third time, to father Quirinus.\xc3\x95\rAnd, at this, Aeneas said (since he saw a youth of outstanding\rbeauty with shining armour, walking with Marcellus,\rbut his face lacking in joy, and his eyes downcast):\r\xc3\x94Father, who is this who accompanies him on his way?\rHis son: or another of his long line of descendants?\rWhat murmuring round them! What presence he has!\rBut dark night, with its sad shadows, hovers round his head.\xc3\x95\rThen his father Aeneas, with welling tears, replied:\r\xc3\x94O, do not ask about your people\xc3\x95s great sorrow, my son.\rThe Fates will only show him to the world, not allow him\rto stay longer. The Roman people would seem\rtoo powerful to you gods, if this gift were lasting.\rWhat mourning from mankind that Field of Mars will \rdeliver to the mighty city! And what funeral processions\ryou, Tiber, will see, as you glide past his new-made tomb!\rNo boy of the line of Ilius shall so exalt his Latin \rancestors by his show of promise, nor will Romulus\xc3\x95s\rland ever take more pride in one of its sons.\rAlas for virtue, alas for the honour of ancient times, \rand a hand invincible in war! No one might have attacked him\rsafely when armed, whether he met the enemy on foot,\ror dug his spurs into the flank of his foaming charger.\rAh, boy to be pitied, if only you may shatter harsh fate,\ryou\xc3\x95ll be a Marcellus! Give me handfuls of white lilies,\rlet me scatter radiant flowers, let me load my scion\xc3\x95s spirit\rwith those gifts at least, in discharging that poor duty.\xc3\x95\r\rBKVI:886-901 THE GATES OF SLEEP\r\rSo they wander here and there through the whole region,\rover the wide airy plain, and gaze at everything.\rAnd when Anchises has led his son through each place,\rand inflamed his spirit with love of the glory that is to come,\rhe tells him then of the wars he must soon fight,\rand teaches him about the Laurentine peoples,\rand the city of Latinus, and how to avoid or face each trial.\rThere are two gates of Sleep: one of which is said to be of horn,\rthrough which an easy passage is given to true shades, the other\rgleams with the whiteness of polished ivory, but through it\rthe Gods of the Dead send false dreams to the world above.\rAfter his words, Anchises accompanies his son there, and,\rfrees him, together with the Sibyl, through the ivory gate.\rAeneas makes his way to the ships and rejoins his friends:\rthen coasts straight to Caieta\xc3\x95s harbour along the shore.\rThe anchors are thrown from the prows: on the shore the sterns rest. \r\r\n\r\rBOOK VII\r\r\rBKVII:1-36 THE TROJANS REACH THE TIBER\r\rCaieta, Aeneas\xc3\x95s nurse, you too have granted \reternal fame to our shores in dying: \rtributes still protect your grave, and your name\rmarks your bones in great Hesperia, if that is glory.\rNow, as soon as the open sea was calm, having paid \rthe last rites due to custom, and raised a funeral mound,\rAeneas the good left the harbour and sailed on his way.\rThe breezes blew through the night, and a radiant moon was no\rinhibitor to their voyage, the sea gleaming in the tremulous light.\rThe next shores they touched were Circe\xc3\x95s lands,\rwhere that rich daughter of the sun makes the hidden groves\recho with continual chanting, and burns fragrant cedar\rfor nocturnal light in her proud palace, as she sets\rher melodious shuttle running through the fine warp.\rFrom there the angry roar of lions could be heard,\rchafing at their ropes, and sounding late into the night,\rand the rage of bristling wild-boars, and caged bears,\rand the howling shapes of huge wolves,\rwhom Circe, cruel goddess, had altered from human appearance \rto the features and forms of creatures, using powerful herbs.\rBut Neptune filled their sails with following winds, so that\rTroy\xc3\x95s virtuous race should not suffer so monstrous a fate\rentering the harbour, and disembarking on that fatal shore,\rand carried them past the boiling shallows, granting them escape.\rNow the sea was reddening with the sun\xc3\x95s rays, and saffron Aurora\rin her rose-coloured chariot, shone from the heights of heaven,\rwhen the winds dropped and every breeze suddenly fell away,\rand the oars laboured slowly in the water. At this moment,\rgazing from the sea, Aeneas saw a vast forest. Through it \rthe Tiber\xc3\x95s lovely river, with swirling eddies full of golden sand,\rbursts to the ocean. Countless birds, around and above,\rthat haunt the banks and streams, were delighting \rthe heavens with their song and flying through the groves.\rHe ordered his friends to change course and turn their prows\rtowards land, and joyfully entered the shaded river.\r\rBKVII:37-106 KING LATINUS AND THE ORACLE\r\rCome now, Erato, and I\xc3\x95ll tell of the kings, the times, \rthe state of ancient Latium, when that foreign\rtroop first landed on Ausonia\xc3\x95s shores, and I\xc3\x95ll recall\rthe first fighting from its very beginning. You goddess, \ryou must prompt your poet. I\xc3\x95ll tell of brutal war,\rI\xc3\x95ll tell of battle action, and princes driven to death \rby their courage, of Trojan armies, and all of Hesperia\rforced to take up arms. A greater order of things\ris being born, greater is the work that I attempt.\rKing Latinus, now old in years, ruled fields\rand towns, in the tranquillity of lasting peace.\rWe hear he was the child of Faunus and the Laurentine\rnymph, Marica. Faunus\xc3\x95s father was Pictus, and he boasts\ryou, Saturn, as his, you the first founder of the line.\rBy divine decree, Latinus had no male heir, his son \rhaving been snatched from him in the dawn of first youth.\rThere was only a daughter to keep house in so noble a palace,\rnow ready for a husband, now old enough to be a bride.\rMany sought her hand, from wide Latium and all Ausonia,\rTurnus above all, the most handsome, of powerful ancestry,\rwhom the queen hastened to link to her as her son-in-law\rwith wonderful affection. But divine omens, with their many\rterrors, prevented it. There was a laurel, with sacred leaves, \rin the high inner court in the middle of the palace, \rthat had been guarded with reverence for many years.\rIt was said that Lord Latinus himself had discovered it,\rwhen he first built his fortress, and dedicated it to Apollo,\rand from it had named the settlers Laurentines.\rA dense cloud of bees (marvellous to tell) borne\rthrough the clear air, with a mighty humming,\rsettled in the very top of the tree, and hung there,\rtheir feet all tangled together, in a sudden swarm.\rImmediately the prophet cried: \xc3\x94I see a foreign hero,\rapproaching, and, from a like direction, an army\rseeks this same place, to rule from the high citadel.\xc3\x95\rThen as he lit the altars with fresh pine torches,\ras virgin Lavinia stood there next to her father\rshe seemed (horror!) to catch the fire in her long tresses,\rand all her finery to burn in crackling flame, her royally\rdressed tresses set alight, her crown alight, remarkable\rfor its jewels: then wreathed in smoke and yellow light,\rshe seemed to scatter sparks through all the palace.\rTruly it was talked of as a shocking and miraculous sight:\rfor they foretold she would be bright with fame and fortune,\rbut it signified a great war for her people.\rThen the king, troubled by the wonder, visited the oracle\rof Faunus, his far-speaking father, and consulted the groves\rbelow high Albunea, mightiest of forests, that echoed\rwith the sacred fountain, and breathed a deadly vapour from the dark.\rThe people of Italy, and all the Oenotrian lands, sought answers\rto their doubts, from that place: when the priest brought\rofferings there, and, found sleep, in the silent night, lying\ron spread fleeces of sacrificed sheep, he saw there many ghosts\rflitting in marvellous forms, and heard various voices, had speech\rwith the gods, and talked with Acheron, in the depths of Avernus.\rAnd here the king, Latinus, himself seeking an answer,\rslaughtered a hundred woolly sheep according to the rite,\rand lay there supported by their skins and woolly fleeces:\rSuddenly a voice emerged from the deep wood:\r\xc3\x94O my son, don\xc3\x95t try to ally your daughter in a Latin marriage,\rdon\xc3\x95t place your faith in the intended wedding:\rstrangers will come to be your kin, who\xc3\x95ll lift our name\rto the stars by their blood, and the children \rof whose race shall see all, where the circling sun\rviews both oceans, turning obediently beneath their feet.\xc3\x95\rLatinus failed to keep this reply of his Father\xc3\x95s quiet,\rthis warning given in the silent night, and already\rRumour flying far and wide had carried it through\rthe Ausonian cities, when the children of Laomedon \rcame to moor their ships by the river\xc3\x95s grassy banks.\r\rBKVII:107-147 FULFILMENT OF A PROPHECY\r\rAeneas, handsome Iulus, and the foremost leaders,\rsettled their limbs under the branches of a tall tree,\rand spread a meal: they set wheat cakes for a base\runder the food (as Jupiter himself inspired them) \rand added wild fruits to these tables of Ceres.\rWhen the poor fare drove them to set their teeth\rinto the thin discs, the rest being eaten, and to break \rthe fateful circles of bread boldly with hands and jaws,\rnot sparing the quartered cakes, Iulus, jokingly,\rsaid no more than: \xc3\x94Ha! Are we eating the tables too?\xc3\x95\rThat voice on first being heard brought them to the end\rof their labours, and his father, as the words fell \rfrom the speaker\xc3\x95s lips, caught them up \rand stopped him, awestruck at the divine will. \rImmediately he said: \xc3\x94Hail, land destined to me\rby fate, and hail to you, O faithful gods of Troy:\rhere is our home, here is our country. For my father\rAnchises (now I remember) left this secret of fate with me:\r\xc3\x94Son, when you\xc3\x95re carried to an unknown shore, food is lacking, \rand you\xc3\x95re forced to eat the tables, then look for a home\rin your weariness: and remember first thing to set your hand\ron a site there, and build your houses behind a rampart.\xc3\x95 \rThis was the hunger he prophesied, the last thing remaining,\rto set a limit to our ruin\xc3\x89come then,\rand with the sun\xc3\x95s dawn light let\xc3\x95s cheerfully discover\rwhat place this is, what men live here, where this people\xc3\x95s city is,\rand let\xc3\x95s explore from the harbour in all directions.\rNow pour libations to Jove and call, with prayer, \ron my father Anchises, then set out the wine once more.\rSo saying he wreathed his forehead with a leafy spray,\rand prayed to the spirit of the place, and to Earth the oldest\rof goddesses, and to the Nymphs, and the yet unknown rivers:\rthen he invoked Night and Night\xc3\x95s rising constellations,\rand Idaean Jove, and the Phrygian Mother, in order,\rand his two parents, one in heaven, one in Erebus.\rAt this the all-powerful Father thundered three times\rfrom the clear sky, and revealed a cloud in the ether,\rbright with rays of golden light, shaking it with his own hand.\rThen the word ran suddenly through the Trojan lines\rthat the day had come to found their destined city.\rThey rivalled each other in celebration of the feast, and delighted\rby the fine omen, set out the bowls and crowned the wine-cups.\r\rBKVII:148-191 THE PALACE OF LATINUS\r\rNext day when sunrise lit the earth with her first flames,\rthey variously discovered the city, shores and limits \rof this nation: here was the pool of Numicius\xc3\x95s fountain,\rthis was the River Tiber, here the brave Latins lived.\rThen Anchises\xc3\x95s son ordered a hundred envoys, chosen\rfrom every rank, all veiled in Pallas\xc3\x95s olive leaves\rto go to the king\xc3\x95s noble fortress, carrying gifts \rfor a hero, and requesting peace towards the Trojans. \rWithout delay, they hastened as ordered, travelling \rat a swift pace. He himself marked out walls with a shallow ditch,\rtoiled at the site, and surrounded the first settlement on those shores\rwith a rampart and battlement, in the style of a fortified camp.\rAnd now his men had pursued their journey and they saw\rLatinus\xc3\x95s turrets and high roofs, and arrived beneath the walls.\rBoys, and men in the flower of youth, were practising\rhorsemanship outside the city, breaking in their mounts \rin clouds of dust, or bending taut bows, or hurling firm spears \rwith their arms, challenging each other to race or box:\rwhen a messenger, racing ahead on his horse, reported\rto the ears of the aged king that powerful warriors in unknown\r\r\r\r\rAeneas at the Court of Latinus\rFerdinand Bol (The Netherlands, 1616 - 1680)\rRijksmuseum\r\r\n\rdress had arrived. The king ordered them to be summoned\rto the palace, and took his seat, in the centre, on his ancestral throne.\rHuge and magnificent, raised on a hundred columns, \rhis roof was the city\xc3\x95s summit, the palace of Laurentian Picus,\rsanctified by its grove and the worship of generations.\rIt was auspicious for a king to receive the sceptre here and first lift\rthe fasces, the rods of office: this shrine was their curia,\rtheir senate house, the place of their sacred feasts, here the elders,\rafter lambs were sacrificed, sat down at an endless line of tables.\rThere standing in ranks at the entrance were the statues of ancestors \rof old, in ancient cedar-wood, Italus, and father Sabinus, the vine-\r grower,\rdepicted guarding a curved pruning-hook, and aged Saturn, \rand the image of Janus bi-face, and other kings from the beginning, \rand heroes wounded in battle, fighting for their country.\rMany weapons too hung on the sacred doorposts,\rcaptive chariots, curved axes, helmet crests, the massive bars\rof city gates, spears, shields and the ends of prows torn from ships.\rThere Picus, the Horse-Tamer, sat, holding the lituus, the augur\xc3\x95s\rQuirinal staff, and clothed in the trabea, the purple-striped toga,\rand carrying the ancile, the sacred shield, in his left hand,\rhe, whom his lover, Circe, captivated by desire, struck \rwith her golden rod: changed him with magic drugs\rto a woodpecker, and speckled his wings with colour.\r\rBKVII:192-248 THE TROJANS SEEK ALLIANCE WITH LATINUS \r\rSuch was the temple of the gods in which Latinus, seated\ron the ancestral throne, called the Trojans to him in the palace,\rand as they entered spoke first, with a calm expression:\r\xc3\x94Sons of Dardanus (for your city and people are not unknown\rto us, and we heard of your journey towards us on the seas),\rwhat do you wish? What reason, what need has brought \ryour ships to Ausonian shores, over so many azure waves?\rWhether you have entered the river mouth, and lie in harbour,\rafter straying from your course, or driven here by storms,\rsuch things as sailors endure on the deep ocean,\rdon\xc3\x95t shun our hospitality, and don\xc3\x95t neglect the fact\rthat the Latins are Saturn\xc3\x95s people, just, not through constraint or law,\rbut of our own free will, holding to the ways of the ancient god.\rAnd I remember in truth (though the tale is obscured by time)\rthat the Auruncan elders told how Dardanus, sprung \rfrom these shores, penetrated the cities of Phrygian Ida,\rand Thracian Samos, that is now called Samothrace.\rSetting out from here, from his Etruscan home, Corythus,\rnow the golden palace of the starlit sky grants him a throne,\rand he increases the number of divine altars.\xc3\x95\rHe finished speaking, and Ilioneus, following, answered so:\r\xc3\x94King, illustrious son of Faunus, no dark tempest, driving\rus though the waves, forced us onto your shores,\rno star or coastline deceived us in our course:\rwe travelled to this city by design, and with willing hearts,\rexiled from our kingdom, that was once the greatest\rthat the sun gazed on, as he travelled from the edge of heaven.\rThe founder of our race is Jove, the sons of Dardanus enjoy\rJove as their ancestor, our king himself is of Jove\xc3\x95s high race:\rTrojan, Aeneas, sends us to your threshold.\rThe fury of the storm that poured from fierce Mycenae,\rand crossed the plains of Ida, and how the two worlds of Europe\rand Asia clashed, driven by fate, has been heard by those whom\rthe most distant lands banish to where Ocean circles back,\rand those whom the zone of excessive heat, stretched \rbetween the other four, separates from us. \rSailing out of that deluge, over many wastes of sea,\rwe ask a humble home for our country\xc3\x95s gods, and a harmless\rstretch of shore, and air and water accessible to all.\rWe\xc3\x95ll be no disgrace to the kingdom, nor will your reputation\rbe spoken of lightly, nor gratitude for such an action fade,\rnor Ausonia regret taking Troy to her breast.\rI swear by the destiny of Aeneas, and the power of his right hand,\rwhether proven by any man in loyalty, or war and weapons,\rmany are the peoples, many are the nations (do not scorn us\rbecause we offer peace-ribbons, and words of prayer, unasked)\rwho themselves sought us and wished to join with us:\rbut through divine destiny we sought out your shores\rto carry out its commands. Dardanus sprang from here,\rApollo recalls us to this place, and, with weighty orders, drives us\rto Tuscan Tiber, and the sacred waters of the Numician fount.  \rMoreover our king offers you these small tokens of his\rformer fortune, relics snatched from burning Troy.\rHis father Anchises poured libations at the altar from this gold,\rthis was Priam\xc3\x95s burden when by custom he made laws\rfor the assembled people, the sceptre, and sacred turban,\rand the clothes, laboured on by the daughters of Ilium.\xc3\x95\r\rBKVII:249-285 LATINUS OFFERS PEACE\r\rAt Ilioneus\xc3\x95s words Latinus kept his face set firmly\rdownward, fixed motionless towards the ground, moving his eyes\ralone intently. It is not the embroidered purple that moves\rthe king nor Priam\xc3\x95s sceptre, so much as his dwelling\ron his daughter\xc3\x95s marriage and her bridal-bed,\rand he turns over in his mind old Faunus\xc3\x95s oracle:\rthis must be the man, from a foreign house, prophesied\rby the fates as my son-in-law, and summoned to reign\rwith equal powers, whose descendants will be illustrious\rin virtue, and whose might will take possession of all the world.\rAt last he spoke, joyfully: \xc3\x94May the gods favour this beginning,\rand their prophecy. Trojan, what you wish shall be granted.\rI do not reject your gifts: you will not lack the wealth\rof fertile fields, or Troy\xc3\x95s wealth, while Latinus is king.\rOnly, if Aeneas has such longing for us, if he is eager\rto join us in friendship and be called our ally, let him come\rhimself and not be afraid of a friendly face: it will be\rpart of the pact, to me, to have touched your leader\xc3\x95s hand.\rNow you in turn take my reply to the king:\rI have a daughter whom the oracles from my father\xc3\x95s shrine,\rand many omens from heaven, will not allow to unite\rwith a husband of our race: sons will come from foreign shores,\rwhose blood will raise our name to the stars: this they prophesy\ris in store for Latium,. I both think and, if my mind foresees \rthe truth, I hope that this is the man destiny demands.\xc3\x95\rSo saying the king selected stallions from his whole stable\r(three hundred stood there sleekly in their high stalls):\rimmediately he ordered one to be led to each Trojan by rank,\rcaparisoned in purple, swift-footed, with embroidered housings\r(gold collars hung low over their chests, covered in gold,\rthey even champed bits of yellow gold between their teeth),\rand for the absent Aeneas there was a chariot, with twin horses,\rof heaven\xc3\x95s line, blowing fire from their nostrils,\rbastards of that breed of her father\xc3\x95s, the Sun, that cunning\rCirce had produced, by mating them with a mortal mare.\rThe sons of Aeneas, mounting the horses, rode back\rwith these words and gifts of Latinus, bearing peace.\r\rBKVII:286-341 JUNO SUMMONS ALLECTO\r \rBut behold, the ferocious wife of Jove returning \rfrom Inachus\xc3\x95s Argos, winging her airy way,\rsaw the delighted Aeneas and his Trojan fleet,\rfrom the distant sky, beyond Sicilian Pachynus.\rShe gazed at them, already building houses, already confident\rin their land, the ships deserted: she halted pierced by a bitter pang.\rThen shaking her head, she poured these words from her breast:\r\xc3\x94Ah loathsome tribe, and Trojan destiny, opposed to my\rown destiny! Could they not have fallen on the Sigean plains,\rcould they not have been held as captives? Could burning Troy\rnot have consumed these men? They find a way through \rthe heart of armies and flames. And I think my powers must\rbe exhausted at last, or I have come to rest, my anger sated.\rWhy, when they were thrown out of their country I ventured\rto follow hotly through the waves, and challenge them on every ocean.\rThe forces of sea and sky have been wasted on these Trojans.\rWhat use have the Syrtes been to me, or Scylla, or gaping\rCharybdis? They take refuge in their longed-for Tiber\xc3\x95s channel,\rindifferent to the sea and to me. Mars had the power \rto destroy the Lapiths\xc3\x95 vast race, the father of the gods himself\rconceded ancient Calydon, given Diana\xc3\x95s anger, \rand for what sin did the Lapiths or Calydon, deserve all that?\rBut I, Jove\xc3\x95s great Queen, who in my wretchedness had the power\rto leave nothing untried, who have turned myself to every means,\ram conquered by Aeneas. But if my divine strength is not \renough, I won\xc3\x95t hesitate to seek help wherever it might be:\rif I cannot sway the gods, I\xc3\x95ll stir the Acheron.\rI accept it\xc3\x95s not granted to me to withhold the Latin kingdom,\rand by destiny Lavinia will still, unalterably, be his bride:\rbut I can draw such things out and add delays,\rand I can destroy the people of these two kings.\rLet father and son-in-law unite at the cost of their nations\xc3\x95 lives:\rvirgin, your dowry will be Rutulian and Trojan blood,\rand Bellona, the goddess of war, waits to attend your marriage.\rNor was it Hecuba, Cisseus\xc3\x95s daughter, alone who was pregnant\rwith a fire-brand, or gave birth to nuptial flames.\rWhy, Venus is alike in her child, another Paris,\ranother funeral torch for a resurrected Troy.\xc3\x95\rWhen she had spoken these words, fearsome, she sought the earth:\rand summoned Allecto, the grief-bringer, from the house \rof the Fatal Furies, from the infernal shadows: in whose\rmind are sad wars, angers and deceits, and guilty crimes.\rA monster, hated by her own father Pluto, hateful \rto her Tartarean sisters: she assumes so many forms,\rher features are so savage, she sports so many black vipers.\rJuno roused her with these words, saying:\r\xc3\x94Grant me a favour of my own, virgin daughter of Night,\rthis service, so that my honour and glory are not weakened,\rand give way, and the people of Aeneas cannot woo\rLatinus with intermarriage, or fill the bounds of Italy.\rYou\xc3\x95ve the power to rouse brothers, who are one, to conflict, \rand overturn homes with hatred: you bring the scourge\rand the funeral torch into the house: you\xc3\x95ve a thousand names,\rand a thousand noxious arts. Search your fertile breast,\rshatter the peace accord, sow accusations of war:\rlet men in a moment need, demand and seize their weapons.\xc3\x95\r\rBKVII:341-405 ALLECTO MADDENS QUEEN AMATA\r\rSo Allecto, steeped in the Gorgon\xc3\x95s poison, first searches out\rLatium and the high halls of the Laurentine king,\rand sits at the silent threshold of Queen Amata, whom\rconcerns and angers have troubled, with a woman\xc3\x95s passion,\rconcerning the Trojan\xc3\x95s arrival, and Turnus\xc3\x95s marriage. \rThe goddess flings a snake at her from her dark locks,\rand plunges it into the breast, to her innermost heart, so that\rmaddened by the creature, she might trouble the whole palace.\rSliding between her clothing, and her polished breast,\rit winds itself unfelt and unknown to the frenzied woman,\rbreathing its viperous breath: the powerful snake becomes her\rtwisted necklace of gold, becomes the loop of her long ribbon,\rknots itself in her hair, and roves slithering down her limbs.\rAnd while at first the sickness, sinking within as liquid venom,\rpervades her senses, and clasps her bones with fire,\rand before her mind has felt the flame through all its thoughts,\rshe speaks, softly, and in a mother\xc3\x95s usual manner, \rweeping greatly over the marriage of her daughter to the Trojan:\r\xc3\x94O, have you her father no pity for your daughter or yourself?\rHave you no pity for her mother, when the faithless seducer\rwill leave with the first north-wind, seeking the deep, with the girl\ras prize? Wasn\xc3\x95t it so when Paris, that Phrygian shepherd,\rentered Sparta, and snatched Leda\xc3\x95s Helen off to the Trojan cities?\rWhat of your sacred pledge? What of your former care for your own\rpeople, and your right hand given so often to your kinsman Turnus?\rIf a son-in-law from a foreign tribe is sought for the Latins,\rand it\xc3\x95s settled, and your father Faunus\xc3\x95s command weighs on you,\rthen I myself think that every land free of our rule \rthat is distant, is foreign: and so the gods declare. \rAnd if the first origins of his house are traced, Inachus \rand Acrisius are ancestors of Turnus, and Mycenae his heartland.\xc3\x95\rWhen, though trying in vain with words, she sees Latinus\rstand firm against her, and when the snake\xc3\x95s maddening venom\rhas seeped deep into her flesh, and permeated throughout,\rthen, truly, the unhappy queen, goaded by monstrous horrors,\rrages madly unrestrainedly through the vast city.\rAs a spinning-top, sometimes, that boys intent on play thrash \rin a circle round an empty courtyard, turns under the whirling lash,\r- driven with the whip it moves in curving tracks: and the childish crowd\rmarvel over it in innocence, gazing at the twirling boxwood:\rand the blows grant it life: so she is driven through the heart\rof cities and proud peoples, on a course that is no less swift.\rMoreover, she runs to the woods, pretending Bacchic possession,\rsetting out on a greater sin, and creating a wider frenzy,\rand hides her daughter among the leafy mountains,\rto rob the Trojans of their wedding and delay the nuptials,\rshrieking \xc3\x94Euhoe\xc3\x95 to Bacchus, crying \xc3\x94You alone are worthy\rof this virgin: it\xc3\x95s for you in truth she lifts the soft thyrsus,\ryou she circles in the dance, for you she grows her sacred hair.\xc3\x95\rRumour travels: and the same frenzy drives all the women, \rinflamed, with madness in their hearts, to seek strange shelter.\rThey leave their homes, and bare their head and neck to the winds:\rwhile others are already filling the air with vibrant howling\rcarrying vine-wrapped spears, and clothed in fawn-skins.\rThe wild Queen herself brandishes a blazing pine-branch \rin their midst, turning her bloodshot gaze on them, and sings\rthe wedding-song for Turnus and her daughter, and, suddenly\rfierce, cries out: \xc3\x94O, women of Latium, wherever you are, hear me: \rif you still have regard for unhappy Amata  in your pious hearts, \rif you\xc3\x95re stung with concern for a mother\xc3\x95s rights,\rloose the ties from your hair, join the rites with me.\xc3\x95\rSo Allecto drives the Queen with Bacchic goad, far and wide,\rthrough the woods, among the wild creatures\xc3\x95 lairs.\r\rBKVII:406-474 ALLECTO ROUSES TURNUS\r\rWhen she saw she had stirred these first frenzies enough,\rand had disturbed Latinus\xc3\x95s plans, and his whole household,\rthe grim goddess was carried from there, at once, on dark wings,\rto the walls of Turnus, the brave Rutulian, the city they say\rthat Danae, blown there by a violent southerly, built\rwith her Acrisian colonists. The place was once called Ardea\rby our ancestors, and Ardea still remains as a great name,\rits good-fortune past. Here, in the dark of night, \rTurnus was now in a deep sleep, in his high palace.\rAllecto changed her fierce appearance and fearful shape,\rtransformed her looks into those of an old woman,\rfurrowed her ominous brow with wrinkles, assumed\rwhite hair and sacred ribbon, then twined an olive spray there:\rshe became Calybe, Juno\xc3\x95s old servant, and priestess of her temple,\rand offered herself to the young man\xc3\x95s eyes with these words:\r\xc3\x94Turnus, will you see all your efforts wasted in vain,\rand your sceptre handed over to Trojan settlers?\rThe king denies you your bride and the dowry looked for\rby your race, and a stranger is sought as heir to the throne.\rGo then, be despised, offer yourself, un-thanked, to danger:\rgo, cut down the Tuscan ranks, protect the Latins with peace!\rThis that I now say to you, as you lie there in the calm of night,\rSaturn\xc3\x95s all-powerful daughter herself ordered me to speak openly.\rSo rise, and ready your men, gladly, to arm and march \rfrom the gates to the fields, and set fire to the painted ships\ranchored in our noble river, and the Trojan leaders with them.\rThe vast power of the gods demands it. Let King Latinus \rhimself feel it, unless he agrees to keep his word and give you\ryour bride, and let him at last experience Turnus armed.\xc3\x95\rAt this the warrior, mocking the priestess, opened his mouth in turn:\r\xc3\x94The news that a fleet has entered Tiber\xc3\x95s waters \rhas not escaped my notice, as you think: \rdon\xc3\x95t imagine it\xc3\x95s so great a fear to me. \rNor is Queen Juno unmindful of me.\rBut you, O mother, old age, conquered by weakness\rand devoid of truth, troubles with idle cares, and mocks\ra prophetess, amidst the wars of kings, with imaginary terrors.\rYour duty\xc3\x95s to guard the gods\xc3\x95 statues and their temples:\rmen will make war and peace, by whom war\xc3\x95s to be made.\xc3\x95 \rAllecto blazed with anger at these words.\rAnd, as the young man spoke, a sudden tremor seized his body,\rand his eyes became fixed, the Fury hissed with so many snakes,\rsuch a form revealed itself: then turning her fiery gaze on him,\rshe pushed him away as he hesitated, trying to say more,\rand raised up a pair of serpents amidst her hair,\rand cracked her whip, and added this through rabid lips:\r\xc3\x94See me, conquered by weakness, whom old age, devoid of truth,\rmocks with imaginary terrors amongst the wars of kings.\rLook on this: I am here from the house of the Fatal Sisters,\rand I bring war and death in my hand.\xc3\x95\rSo saying, she flung a burning branch at the youth,\rand planted the brand, smoking with murky light, in his chest.\rAn immense terror shattered his sleep, and sweat, pouring \rfrom his whole body drenched flesh and bone.\rFrantic, he shouted for weapons, looked for weapons by the bedside,\rand through the palace: desire for the sword raged in him, \rand the accursed madness of war, anger above all: \ras when burning sticks are heaped, with a fierce crackling,\runder the belly of a raging cauldron, and the depths\rdance with the heat, the smoking mixture seethes inside,\rthe water bubbles high with foam, the liquid can no longer\rcontain itself, and dark vapour rises into the air.\rSo, violating the peace, he commanded his young leaders\rto march against King Latinus, and ordered the troops to be readied,\rto defend Italy, to drive the enemy from her borders:\rhis approach itself would be enough for both Trojans and Latins.\rWhen he gave the word, and called the gods to witness his vows,\rthe Rutuli vied in urging each other to arm. \rThis man is moved by Turnus\xc3\x95s youth and outstanding nobility\rof form, that by his royal line, this one again by his glorious deeds.\r\rBKVII:475-539 ALLECTO AMONG THE TROJANS\r\rWhile Turnus was rousing the Rutulians with fiery courage,\rAllecto hurled herself towards the Trojans, on Stygian wings,\rspying out, with fresh cunning, the place on the shore\rwhere handsome Iulus was hunting wild beasts on foot with nets.\rHades\xc3\x95s Virgin drove his hounds to sudden frenzy,\rtouching their muzzles with a familiar scent, \rso that they eagerly chased down a stag: this was a prime\rcause of trouble, rousing the spirits of the countrymen to war.\rThere was a stag of outstanding beauty, with huge antlers,\rthat, torn from its mother\xc3\x95s teats, Tyrrhus and his sons had raised, \rthe father being the man to whom the king\xc3\x95s herds submitted,\rand who was trusted with managing his lands far and wide.\rSilvia, their sister, training it to her commands with great care,\radorned its antlers, twining them with soft garlands, grooming \rthe wild creature, and bathing it in a clear spring. Tame to the hand, \rand used to food from the master\xc3\x95s table, it wandered the woods, \rand returned to the familiar threshold, by itself, however late at night.\rNow while it strayed far a-field, Iulus the huntsman\xc3\x95s\rfrenzied hounds started it, by chance, as it moved \rdownstream, escaping the heat by the grassy banks. \rIulus himself inflamed also with desire for high\rhonours, aimed an arrow from his curved bow,\rthe goddess unfailingly guiding his errant hand, \rand the shaft, flying with a loud hiss, pierced flank and belly.\rBut the wounded creature fleeing to its familiar home, \rdragged itself groaning to its stall, and, bleeding, filled\rthe house with its cries, like a person begging for help.\rSilvia, the sister, beating her arms with her hands in distress, was\rthe first to call for help, summoning the tough countrymen.\rThey arrived quickly (since a savage beast haunted the silent woods)\rone with a fire-hardened stake, one with a heavy knotted staff:\ranger made a weapon of whatever each man found \ras he searched around. Tyrrhus called out his men:\rsince by chance he was quartering an oak by driving\rwedges, he seized his axe, breathing savagely.\rThen the cruel goddess, seeing the moment to do harm,\rfound the stable\xc3\x95s steep roof, and sounded the herdsmen\xc3\x95s\rcall, sending a voice from Tartarus through the twisted horn,\rso that each grove shivered, and the deep woods echoed:\rDiana\xc3\x95s distant lake at Nemi heard it: white Nar\xc3\x95s river, \rwith its sulphurous waters, heard: and the fountains of Velinus:\rwhile anxious mothers clasped their children to their breasts.\rThen the rough countrymen snatching up their weapons, gathered \rmore quickly, and from every side, to the noise with which\rthat dread trumpet sounded the call, nor were the Trojan\ryouth slow to open their camp, and send out help to Ascanius.\rThe lines were deployed. They no longer competed\rwith solid staffs, and fire-hardened stakes, in a rustic quarrel,\rbut fought it out with double-edged blades, and a dark crop\rof naked swords bristled far and wide: bronze shone \rstruck by the sun, and hurled its light up to the clouds:\ras when a wave begins to whiten at the wind\xc3\x95s first breath,\rand the sea swells little by little, and raises higher waves,\rthen surges to heaven out of its profoundest depths.\rHere young Almo, in the front ranks, the eldest \rof Tyrrhus\xc3\x95s sons, was downed by a hissing arrow:\rthe wound opened beneath his throat, choking the passage\rof liquid speech, and failing breath, with blood.\rThe bodies of many men were round him, old Galaesus\ramong them, killed in the midst of offering peace, who was\rone of the most just of men, and the wealthiest in Ausonian land:\rfive flocks bleated for him, five herds returned \rfrom his fields, and a hundred ploughs furrowed the soil.\r\rBKVII:540-571 ALLECTO RETURNS TO HADES\r\rWhile they fought over the plain, in an equally-matched contest,\rthe goddess, having, by her actions, succeeded in what she\xc3\x95d promised,\rhaving steeped the battle in blood, and brought death in the first skirmish,\rleft Hesperia, and wheeling through the air of heaven\rspoke to Juno, in victory, in a proud voice:\r\xc3\x94Behold, for you, discord is completed with sad war:\rtell them now to unite as friends, or join in alliance.\rSince I\xc3\x95ve sprinkled the Trojans with Ausonian blood,\rI\xc3\x95ll even add this to it, if I\xc3\x95m assured that it\xc3\x95s your wish \rI\xc3\x95ll bring neighbouring cities into the war, with rumour,\rinflaming their minds with love of war\xc3\x95s madness, so that they come\rwith aid from every side: I\xc3\x95ll sow the fields with weapons.\xc3\x95\rThen Juno answered: \xc3\x94That\xc3\x95s more than enough terror and treachery:\rthe reasons for war are there: armed, they fight hand to hand,\rand the weapons that chance first offered are stained with fresh blood.\rSuch be the marriage, such be the wedding-rites that this \rillustrious son of Venus, and King Latinus himself, celebrate.\rThe Father, the ruler of high Olympus, does not wish you\rto wander too freely in the ethereal heavens.\rLeave this place. Whatever chance for trouble remains\rI will handle.\xc3\x95 So spoke Saturn\xc3\x95s daughter:\rNow, the Fury raised her wings, hissing with serpents,\rand sought her home in Cocytus, leaving the heights above.\rThere\xc3\x95s a place in Italy, at the foot of high mountains,\rfamous, and mentioned by tradition, in many lands,\rthe valley of Amsanctus: woods thick with leaves hem it in,\rdarkly, on both sides, and in the centre a roaring torrent\rmakes the rocks echo, and coils in whirlpools.\rThere a fearful cavern, a breathing-hole for cruel Dis,\ris shown, and a vast abyss, out of which Acheron bursts,\rholds open its baleful jaws, into which the Fury, \rthat hated goddess, plunged, freeing earth and sky.\r\rBKVII:572-600 LATINUS ABDICATES\r\rMeanwhile Saturn\xc3\x95s royal daughter was no less active, \rsetting a final touch to the war. The whole band of herdsmen\rrushed into the city from the battle, bringing back the dead,\rthe boy Almo, and Galaesus, with a mangled face,\rand invoking the gods, and entreating Latinus.\rTurnus was there, and ,at the heart of the outcry,\rhe redoubled their terror of fire and slaughter:\r\xc3\x94Trojans are called upon to reign: Phrygian stock\rmixes with ours: I am thrust from the door.\xc3\x95\rThen those whose women, inspired by Bacchus, pranced about\rin the pathless woods, in the god\xc3\x95s dance (for Amata\xc3\x95s name is not trivial),\rdrawing together from every side, gathered to make their appeal to Mars.\rImmediately, with perverse wills, all clamoured for war\xc3\x95s \ratrocities, despite the omens, despite the god\xc3\x95s decrees,.\rThey vied together in surrounding King Latinus\xc3\x95s palace:\rlike an immoveable rock in the ocean, he stood firm,\rlike a rock in the ocean, when a huge breaker falls, \rholding solid amongst a multitude of howling waves,\rwhile round about the cliffs and foaming reefs roar, in vain,\rand seaweed, hurled against its sides, is washed back again.\rAs no power was really granted him to conquer\rtheir blind will, and events moved to cruel Juno\xc3\x95s orders, \rwith many appeals to the gods and the helpless winds,\rthe old man cried: \xc3\x94Alas, we are broken by fate, and swept away\rby the storm! Oh, wretched people, you\xc3\x95ll pay the price yourselves\rfor this, with sacrilegious blood. You, Turnus, your crime and its\rpunishment await you, and too late you\xc3\x95ll entreat the gods with prayers.\rMy share is rest, yet at the entrance to the harbour\rI\xc3\x95m robbed of all contentment in dying.\xc3\x95 Speaking no more\rhe shut himself in the palace, and let fall the reins of power.\r\rBKVII:601-640 LATIUM PREPARES FOR WAR\r\rThere was a custom in Hesperian Latium, which \rthe Alban cities always held sacred, as great Rome \rdoes now, when they first rouse Mars to battle, \rwhether they prepare to take sad war in their hands \rto the Getae, the Hyrcanians, or the Arabs, or to head East\rpursuing the Dawn, to reclaim their standards from Parthia:\rthere are twin gates of War (so they are named),\rsanctified by religion, and by dread of fierce Mars:\ra hundred bars of bronze, and iron\xc3\x95s eternal strength,\rlock them, and Janus the guardian never leaves the threshold.\rWhen the final decision of the city fathers is for battle, \rthe Consul himself, dressed in the Quirine toga, folded\rin the Gabine manner, unbars these groaning doors, himself,\rand himself invokes the battle: then the rest of the men \rdo so too, and bronze horns breathe their hoarse assent.\rLatinus was also commanded to declare war in this way \ron Aeneas\xc3\x95s people, and unbolt the sad gates, \rbut the old man held back his hand, and shrank \rfrom the vile duty, hiding himself in dark shadows. \rThen the Queen of the gods, gliding from the sky,\rset the reluctant doors in motion, with her own hand:\rSaturn\xc3\x95s daughter forced open the iron gates of War\ron their hinges. Italy, once peaceful and immoveable, was alight.\rSome prepared to cross the plains on foot, others stirred \rthe deep dust on noble horses: all demanded weapons.\rOthers polished smooth shields, and bright javelins,\rwith thick grease, and sharpened axes on grindstones:\rthey delighted in carrying standards and hearing the trumpet call.\rSo five great cities set up anvils and forged \rnew weapons: powerful Atina, proud Tibur, \rArdea, Crustumeri, and towered Antemnae.\rThey beat out helmets to protect their heads, and wove\rwickerwork frames for shields: others hammered\rbreastplates of bronze, and shiny greaves of malleable silver:\rto this they yielded pride in the share\xc3\x95s blade and the sickle, all their \rpassion for the plough: they recast their father\xc3\x95s swords in the furnace.\rAnd now the trumpets began to sound, the word that signalled war \rwent round: this man, in alarm, snatched his helmet from his home, \ranother harnessed quivering horses to the yoke, took up his shield,\rand triple-linked coat of mail, and fastened on his faithful sword. \r\rBKVII:641-782 THE BATTLE-LIST\r\rNow Muses, open wide Helicon, and begin a song\rof kings who were roused to war: what ranks of followers\reach one had, filling the plain: with what men even then\rItaly\xc3\x95s rich earth flowered: with what armies she shone:\rsince, goddesses, you remember, and have the power to tell:\rwhile a faint breath of their fame has barely reached us.\rFirst fierce Mezentius enters the war, that scorner of gods,\rfrom the Tuscan shore, and rouses his troops to arms.\rHis son, Lausus, is beside him, than whom no other is\rmore handsome in form, except Laurentine Turnus.\rLausus, the tamer of horses, who subdues wild beasts,\rleads a thousand men from Agylla\xc3\x95s town, who follow him\rin vain, deserving to be happier than under his father\xc3\x95s \rrule, a father who might perhaps not be a Mezentius.\rAventinus follows them, the handsome son of handsome Hercules,\rdisplaying his palm-crowned chariot and victorious horses,\rover the turf, and carries his father\xc3\x95s emblem on his shield: \ra hundred snakes, and the Hydra wreathed with serpents:\rthe priestess Rhea brought him to the shores of light,\rin a secret birth, in the woods, on the Aventine Hill,\ra woman mated to a god when Tyrinthian Hercules,\rthe conqueror who slew Geryon, came to the Laurentine fields,\rand bathed his Spanish cattle in the Tuscan stream. \rHis men carry javelins and grim pikes, in their hands, to war,\rand fight with polished swords and Sabellian spears.\rHe himself, on foot, a huge lion skin swinging,\rwith terrifying unkempt mane, and with its white teeth\rcrowning his head, enters the royal palace, just like that,\ra savage, with Hercules\xc3\x95s clothing fastened round his shoulders.\rThen twin-brothers, Catillus, and brave Coras, \rArgive youths, leaving the walls of Tibur, \rand a people named after their brother Tiburtus,\rborne into the forefront of the army, among the dense spears,\rlike cloud-born Centaurs descending from a high peak \rin the mountains, leaving Homole and snow-covered Othrys\rin their swift course: the vast woods give way as they go,\rand, with a loud crash, the thickets yield to them.\rNor is Caeculus the founder of Praeneste\xc3\x95s city missing,\rwho as every age has believed was born a king, to Vulcan, \ramong the wild cattle, and discovered on the hearth,\rhe\xc3\x95s followed by a rustic army drawn from far and wide,\rmen who live in steep Praeneste, and the fields of Juno\rof Gabii, and beside cool Anio, and among the Hernican rocks\rdew-wet from the streams: those you nurture, rich Anagnia, \rand you father Amasenus. They don\xc3\x95t all have weapons\ror shields, or rumbling chariots: most fling pellets of blue lead,\rsome carry twin darts in their hand, and have reddish \rcaps of wolf-skin for headgear: the left foot is bare \ras they walk, a boot of raw hide protects the other.\rAnd Messapus, Neptune\xc3\x95s son, tamer of horses,\rwhom no one\xc3\x95s permitted to fell with fire or steel,\rnow suddenly calls to arms his settled tribes, and troops\runused to war, and grasps the sword again.\rThese hold Fescennium\xc3\x95s lines and Aequi Falisci\xc3\x95s,\rthose Soracte\xc3\x95s heights and Flavinium\xc3\x95s fields,\rand Ciminus\xc3\x95s lake and hill, and Capena\xc3\x95s groves.\rThey march to a steady beat, and sing of their king:\ras the river Cayster and the Asian meadows, struck from afar,\recho sometimes, when the snowy swans, among the flowing clouds,\rreturn from pasture, and make melodious music from their long throats.\rNo one would think that bronze-clad ranks were joined\rin such a crowd, but an airy cloud of strident birds\rdriving shore-wards from the deep gulf.\rBehold, Clausus, of ancient Sabine blood, leading\ra great army, and worth a great army in his own right.\rNow the Claudian tribe and race has spread, from him,\rthrough Latium, since Rome was shared with the Sabines.\rWith him, a vast company from Amiternum, and ancient Quirites\rfrom Cures, all the forces of Eretum, and olive-clad Mutusca:\rthose who live in Nomentum town, and the Rosean fields, by Lake \rVelinus, those from Tetrica\xc3\x95s bristling cliffs, and from Mount Severus,\rand Casperia and Foruli, and from beside Himella\xc3\x95s stream,\rthose who drink the Tiber and Fabaris, those cold Nursia sent,\rand the armies of Horta and the Latin peoples, \rand those whom Allia, unlucky name, flows between and divides:\ras many as the waves that swell in Libya\xc3\x95s seas,\rwhen fierce Orion\xc3\x95s buried by the wintry waters,\ror thick as the ears of corn scorched by the early sun,\rin the plain of Hermus, or Lycia\xc3\x95s yellow fields.\rThe shields clang, and the earth is terrified by the tramp of feet.\rNext Halaesus, Agamemnon\xc3\x95s son, hostile to the Trojan name,\rharnesses his horses to his chariot, and hastens a thousand\rwarlike tribes to Turnus, men who turn the fertile\rMassic soil for Bacchus, and those the Auruncan elders\rhave sent from the high hills, and the Sidicine levels nearby,\rthose who have left Cales behind, and those who live\rby Volturnus\xc3\x95s shallow river, and by their side the rough \rSaticulan and the Oscan men. Polished javelins are their \rweapons, but their custom is to attach a flexible leash. \rA shield protects their left, with curved swords for close fighting.\rNor shall you, Oebalus, go un-sung in our verses,\ryou whom they say the nymph Sebethis bore to Telon,\rwho is old now, when he held the throne of Teleboan \rCapreae: but not content with his father\xc3\x95s fields, \reven then the son exercised his power over \rthe Sarrastrian peoples, and the plains that Sarnus waters,\rand those who hold Rufrae and Batulum and Celemna\xc3\x95s fields,\rwho are used to throwing their spears in the Teuton fashion:\rand those apple-growers that the ramparts of Abella look down on,\rwhose head-cover is bark stripped from a cork-tree:\rand their bronze shields gleam, their swords gleam with bronze.\rAnd you too Ufens, sent to battle from mountainous Nersae,\rwell known to fame, and fortunate in arms, whose people\rof the hard Aequian earth, are especially \rtough, and hunt extensively in the forests.\rThey plough the earth while armed, and always delight\rin carrying off fresh spoils, and living on plunder.\rThere came a priest as well, of the Marruvian race,\rsent by King Archippus, sporting a frond of fruitful olive\rabove his helmet, Umbro the most-valiant,\rwho, by incantation and touch, was able to shed sleep\ron the race of vipers and water-snakes with poisonous breath,\rsoothing their anger, and curing their bites, by his arts. \rBut he had no power to heal a blow from a Trojan spear-point,\rnor did sleep-inducing charms, or herbs found on Marsian hills, \rhelp him against wounds. For you, Angitia\xc3\x95s grove wept: \rFucinus\xc3\x95s glassy wave, for you: for you, the crystal lakes. \rAnd Virbius, Hippolytus\xc3\x95s son, most handsome, went\rto the war, whom his mother Aricia sent in all his glory,\rHe was reared in Egeria\xc3\x95s groves, round the marshy shores,\rwhere Diana\xc3\x95s altar stands, rich and forgiving.\rFor they tell in story that Hippolytus, after he had fallen prey\rto his stepmother Phaedra\xc3\x95s cunning, and, torn apart by stampeding \rhorses, had paid the debt due to his father with his blood,\rcame again to the heavenly stars, and the upper air beneath\rthe sky, recalled by Apollo\xc3\x95s herbs and Diana\xc3\x95s love.\rThen the all-powerful father, indignant that any mortal\rshould rise from the shadows to the light of life,\rhurled Aesculapius, Apollo\xc3\x95s son, the discoverer \rof such skill and healing, down to the Stygian waves.\rBut kindly Diana hid Hippolytus in a secret place,\rand sent him to the nymph Egeria, to her grove,\rwhere he might spend his life alone, unknown, \rin the Italian woods, his name altered to Virbius.\rSo too horses are kept away from the temple of Diana \rTrivia, and the sacred groves, they who, frightened \rby sea-monsters, spilt chariot and youth across the shore.\r\rBKVII:783-817 TURNUS AND CAMILLA COMPLETE THE ARRAY\r\rTurnus himself went to and from, among the front ranks, grasping\rhis weapons, pre-eminent in form, overtopping the rest by a head. \rHis tall helmet was crowned with a triple plume, holding up\ra Chimaera, breathing the fires of Etna from its jaws,\rsnarling the more, and the more savage with sombre flames\rthe more violent the battle becomes, the more blood is shed.\rBut on his polished shield was Io, with uplifted horns,\rfashioned in gold, already covered with hair, already a heifer,\ra powerful emblem, and Argus, that virgin\xc3\x95s watcher,\rand old Inachus pouring his river out of an engraved urn. \rA cloud of infantry followed, and the ranks with shields\rwere thick along the plain, Argive men \rand Auruncan troops, Rutulians and old Sicanians,\rand the Sacranian lines, and Labicians, their shields painted:\rand those who farmed your woodland pastures, Tiber,\rand Numicius\xc3\x95s holy shore, and those whose ploughshare\rturns Rutulian hills or Circe\xc3\x95s headland, those whose fields\rJupiter of Anxur guards, or Feronia, pleased with her green groves:\rthose from where Satura\xc3\x95s black marsh lies, and from where \rchill Ufens finds his valley\xc3\x95s course, and is buried in the sea.\rBesides all these came Camilla, of the Volscian race,\rleading her line of horse, and troops gleaming with bronze,\ra warrior girl, her hands not trained to Minerva\xc3\x95s distaff,\rand basket of wool, but toughened to endure a fight,\rand, with her quickness of foot, out-strip the winds.\rShe might have skimmed the tips of the stalks of uncut\rcorn, and not bruised their delicate ears with her running:\ror, hanging above the swelling waves, taken her path through\rthe heart of the deep, and not dipped her quick feet in the sea.\rAll of the young men flooding from houses and fields, \rand the crowds of women marvelled, and gazed, at her as she went by,\rin open-mouthed wonder at how the splendour of royal purple\rdraped her smooth shoulders, how her brooch clasped her hair\rwith gold, how she herself carried her Lycian quiver,\rand a shepherd\xc3\x95s myrtle staff, tipped with the point of a spear.\r\r\r\n\r\n\r\rBOOK VIII\r\r\rBKVIII:1-25 THE SITUATION IN LATIUM\r\rWhen Turnus raised the war-banner on the Laurentine \rcitadel, and the trumpets blared out their harsh music,\rwhen he roused his fiery horses and clashed his weapons,\rhearts were promptly stirred, all Latium together\rswore allegiance in restless commotion, and young men \rraged wildly. The main leaders, Messapus, Ufens\rand Mezentius, scorner of gods, gathered their forces\rfrom every side, stripping the broad acres of farmers.\rAnd Venulus was sent to great Diomedes\xc3\x95s city, Arpi,\rto seek help, and explain that the Trojans were planted in Latium,\rAeneas had arrived with his fleet, carrying his vanquished gods,\rand pronouncing himself a king summoned by destiny,\rthat many tribes were joining the Trojan hero,\rand his name was spreading far and wide in Latium.\rWhat Aeneas was intending given these beginnings,\rwhat outcome he desired from the war, if fortune\rfollowed him, might be seen more clearly by Diomedes,\rhimself, than by King Turnus or King Latinus. \rSo it was in Latium. Meanwhile the Trojan hero of Laomedon\xc3\x95s \rline, seeing all this, tosses on a vast sea of cares, \rand swiftly casts his mind this way and that, seizing\ron various ideas, turning everything over: \ras when tremulous light from the water in a bronze bowl,\rthrown back by sunshine, or the moon\xc3\x95s radiant image,\rflickers far and wide over everything, then angles \rupwards, and strikes the panelled ceiling overhead.\r\rBKVIII:26-65 AENEAS\xc3\x95S DREAM OF TIBERINUS\r\rIt was night, and through all the land, deep sleep gripped weary \rcreatures, bird and beast, when Aeneas, the leader, lay down\ron the river-bank, under the cold arch of the heavens, his heart\rtroubled by war\xc3\x95s sadness, and at last allowed his body to rest.\rOld Tiberinus himself, the god of the place, appeared to him, \rrising from his lovely stream, among the poplar leaves \r(fine linen cloaked him in a blue-grey \rmantle, and shadowy reeds hid his hair),\rThen he spoke, and with his words removed all cares:\r\xc3\x94O seed of the race of gods, who bring our Trojan city\rback from the enemy, and guard the eternal fortress,\rlong looked-for on Laurentine soil, and in Latin fields,\rhere is your house, and your house\xc3\x95s gods, for sure \r(do not desist), don\xc3\x95t fear the threat of war,\rthe gods\xc3\x95 swollen anger has died away.\rAnd now, lest you think this sleep\xc3\x95s idle fancy, you\xc3\x95ll find \ra huge sow lying on the shore, under the oak trees, \rthat has farrowed a litter of thirty young, a white sow, \rlying on the ground, with white piglets round her teats,\rThat place shall be your city, there\xc3\x95s true rest from your labours.\rBy this in a space of thirty years Ascanius \rwill found the city of Alba, bright name.\rI do not prophesy unsurely. Now (attend), in a few words\rI\xc3\x95ll explain how you can emerge the victor from what will come.\rArcadians have chosen a site on this coast, a race descended \rfrom Pallas, friends of King Evander, who followed \rhis banner, and located their city in the hills,\rnamed, from their ancestor Pallas, Pallantium. \rThey wage war endlessly with the Latin race: summon them \ras allies to your camp, and join in league with them.\rI\xc3\x95ll guide you myself along the banks by the right channels,\rso you can defeat the opposing current with your oars.\rRise, now, son of the goddess, and, as the first stars set,\roffer the prayers due to Juno, and with humble vows\rovercome her anger and her threats. Pay me honour as victor.\rI am him whom you see scouring the banks, \rwith my full stream, and cutting through rich farmlands,\rblue Tiber, the river most dear to heaven. Here is \rmy noble house, my fount flows through noble cities.\xc3\x95\r\rBKVIII:66-101 AENEAS SAILS TO PALLANTEUM\r\rHe spoke: then the river plunged into a deep pool,\rseeking its floor: night and sleep left Aeneas.\rHe rose and, looking towards the heavenly sun\xc3\x95s\reastern light, raised water from the stream  \rin his cupped hands, and poured out this prayer to heaven:\r\xc3\x94Nymphs, Laurentine Nymphs, from whom come the tribe \rof rivers, and you, O Father Tiber, and your sacred stream, \rreceive Aeneas, and shield him at last from danger.\rIn whatever fountain the water holds you, pitying our trials,\rfrom whatever soil you flow in your supreme beauty,\ryou will always be honoured by my tributes, by my gifts,\rhorned river, ruler of the Hesperian waters.\rO, only be with me and prove your will by your presence.\xc3\x95\rSo he spoke, and chose two galleys from his fleet, manned them\rwith oarsmen, and also equipped his men with weapons.\rBut behold a sudden wonder, marvellous to the sight,\rgleaming white through the trees, a sow the same colour\ras her white litter, seen lying on the green bank: dutiful Aeneas, \rcarrying the sacred vessel, sets her with her young before the altar \rand sacrifices her to you, to you indeed, most powerful Juno.\rTiber calmed his swelling flood all that night long, \rand flowing backwards stilled his silent wave, so that\rhe spread his watery levels as in a gentle pool,\ror placid swamp, so it would be effortless for the oars.\rTherefore they sped on the course begun, with happy\rmurmurs, the oiled pine slipped through the shallows:\rthe waves marvelled, the woods marvelled, unused to the far-gleaming\rshields of heroes, and the painted ships floating in the river.\rThey wore out a night and a day with their rowing\rnavigated long bends, were shaded by many kinds of trees,\rand cut through the green woods, over the calm levels.\rThe fiery sun had climbed to the mid-point of the sky\xc3\x95s arc,\rwhen they saw walls and a fort in the distance, and the scattered\rroofs of houses, which Roman power has now raised heavenwards:\rthen Evander owned a poor affair. They turned the prows\rquickly towards land, and approached the town.\r\rBKVIII:102-151 AENEAS MEETS EVANDER\r\rBy chance that day the Arcadian king was making solemn offering\rto Hercules, Amphitryon\xc3\x95s mighty son, and other gods in a grove \rin front of the city. His son Pallas was with him, and with him \rwere all the leading young men, and his impoverished senate \roffering incense, and the warm blood smoked on the altars.\rWhen they saw the noble ships: that they were gliding \rthrough the shadowy woods, rowing with silent oars:\rthey were alarmed at the sudden sight and rose together,\rleaving the tables. But proud Pallas ordered them not to break off\rthe rites, and seizing his spear flew off to meet the strangers himself, \rand at some distance shouted from a hillock: \xc3\x94Warriors what motive\rdrives you to try unknown paths? Where are you heading? \rWhat people are you? Where from?  Do you bring peace or war?\xc3\x95 \rThen Aeneas the leader spoke from the high stern,\rholding out a branch of olive in peace: \xc3\x94You are looking\rat men of Trojan birth, and spears hostile to the Latins,\rmen whom they force to flee through arrogant warfare.\rWe seek Evander. Take my message and say that the chosen\rleaders of Troy have come, asking for armed alliance.\xc3\x95\rPallas was amazed, awestruck by that great name:\r\xc3\x94O whoever you may be, disembark, and speak to my father\rface to face, and come beneath our roof as a guest.\xc3\x95\rAnd he took his hand and gripped it tight in welcome:\rthey left the river, and went on into the grove.\rThen Aeneas spoke to King Evander, in words of friendship:\r\xc3\x94Noblest of the sons of Greece, whom Fortune determines me\rto make request of, offering branches decked with sacred ribbons:\rindeed I did not fear your being a leader of Greeks, \ran Arcadian, and joined to the race of the twin sons of Atreus,\rsince my own worth, and the god\xc3\x95s holy oracles,\rour fathers being related, your fame known throughout the world,\rconnect me to you, and bring me here willingly, through destiny.\rDardanus, our early ancestor, and leader of Troy\xc3\x95s city,\rborn of Atlantean Electra, as the Greeks assert, voyaged\rto Troy\xc3\x95s Teucrian people: and mightiest Atlas begot Electra, \rhe who supports the heavenly spheres on his shoulders.\rYour ancestor is Mercury, whom lovely Maia conceived,\rand gave birth to on Cyllene\xc3\x95s cold heights:\rand Atlas, if we credit what we hear, begot Maia,\rthat same Atlas who lifts the starry sky. \rSo both our races branch from the one root.\rRelying on this, I decided on no envoys, no prior attempts\rthrough diplomacy: myself, I set before you, myself\rand my own life, and come humbly to your threshold.\rThe same Daunian race pursues us with war, as you yourself,\rindeed they think if they drive us out, nothing will stop them\rbringing all Hesperia completely under their yoke,\rand owning the seas that wash the eastern and western shores.\rAccept and offer friendship. We have brave hearts\rin battle, soldiers and spirits proven in action.\xc3\x95\r\rBKVIII:152-183 EVANDER OFFERS ALLIANCE\r\rAeneas spoke. Evander scanned his face, eyes\rand form, for a long time with his gaze, as he was speaking.\rThen he replied briefly, so: \xc3\x94How gladly I know, and \rwelcome you, bravest of Trojans! How it brings back \ryour father\xc3\x95s speech, the voice and features of noble Anchises!\rFor I recall how Priam, son of Laomedon, visiting the realms\rof his sister, Hesione, and seeking Salamis, \rcame on further to see the chill territories of Arcadia.\rIn those days first youth clothed my cheeks with bloom,\rand I marvelled at the Trojan leaders, and marvelled\rat the son of Laomedon himself: but Anchises as he walked\rwas taller than all. My mind burned with youthful desire\rto address the hero, and clasp his hand in mine:\rI approached and led him eagerly inside the walls of Pheneus.\rOn leaving he gave me a noble quiver \rof Lycian arrows, a cloak woven with gold, \rand a pair of golden bits, that my Pallas now owns.\rSo the hand of mine you look for is joined in alliance,\rand when tomorrow\xc3\x95s dawn returns to the earth,\rI\xc3\x95ll send you off cheered by my help, and aid you with stores.\rMeanwhile, since you come to us as friends, favour us \rby celebrating this annual festival, which it is wrong \rto delay, and become accustomed to your friends\xc3\x95 table.\xc3\x95\rWhen he had spoken he ordered the food and drink\rthat had been removed to be replaced, and seated\rthe warriors himself on the turf benches. \rHe welcomed Aeneas as the principal guest, and invited him\rto a maple-wood throne covered by a shaggy lion\xc3\x95s pelt.\rThen the altar priest with young men he had chosen \rcompeted to bring on the roast meat from the bulls, \rpile the baked bread in baskets, and serve the wine. \rAeneas and the men of Troy feasted on an entire\rchine of beef, and the sacrificial organs.\r\rBKVIII:184-305 THE TALE OF HERCULES AND CACUS\r\rWhen hunger had been banished, and desire for food sated,\rKing Evander said: \xc3\x94No idle superstition, or ignorance \rof the ancient gods, forced these solemn rites of ours,\rthis ritual banquet, this altar to so great a divinity, upon us.\rWe perform them, and repeat the honours due, \rTrojan guest, because we were saved from cruel perils. \rNow look first at this rocky overhanging cliff, how its bulk \ris widely shattered, and the mountain lair stands deserted, \rand the crags have been pulled down in mighty ruin.\rThere was a cave here, receding to vast depths,\runtouched by the sun\xc3\x95s rays, inhabited by the fell shape\rof Cacus, the half-human, and the ground was always warm\rwith fresh blood, and the heads of men, insolently \rnailed to the doors, hung there pallid with sad decay.\rVulcan was father to this monster: and, as he moved\rhis massive bulk, he belched out his dark fires.\rNow at last time brought what we wished, the presence\rand assistance of a god. Hercules, the greatest of avengers,\rappeared, proud of the killing and the spoils of three-fold \rGeryon, driving his great bulls along as victor, \rand his cattle occupied the valley and the river.\rAnd Cacus, his mind mad with frenzy, lest any \rwickedness or cunning be left un-dared or un-tried\rdrove off four bulls of outstanding quality, and as many \rheifers of exceptional beauty, from their stalls.\rand, so there might be no forward-pointing spoor, the thief\rdragged them into his cave by the tail, and, reversing\rthe signs of their tracks, hid them in the stony dark:\rno one seeking them would find a trail to the cave.\rMeanwhile, as Hercules, Amphitryon\xc3\x95s son, was moving \rthe well-fed herd from their stalls, and preparing to leave,\rthe cattle lowed as they went out, all the woods were filled\rwith their complaining, and the sound echoed from the hills.\rOne heifer returned their call, and lowed from the deep cave,\rand foiled Cacus\xc3\x95s hopes from her prison.\rAt this Hercules\xc3\x95s indignation truly blazed, with a venomous\rdark rage: he seized weapons in his hand, and his heavy\rknotted club, and quickly sought the slopes of the high mountain.\rThen for the first time my people saw Cacus afraid, confusion\rin his eyes: he fled at once, swifter than the East Wind,\rheading for his cave: fear lent wings to his feet.\rAs he shut himself in, and blocked the entrance securely,\rthrowing against it a giant rock, hung there in chains \rby his father\xc3\x95s craft, by shattering the links, behold\rHercules arrived in a tearing passion, turning his head\rthis way and that, scanning every approach, and gnashing\rhis teeth. Hot with rage, three times he circled the whole \rAventine Hill, three times he tried the stony doorway in vain,\rthree times he sank down, exhausted, in the valley.\rA sharp pinnacle of flint, the rock shorn away \ron every side, stood, tall to see, rising behind \rthe cave, a suitable place for vile birds to nest.\rHe shook it, where it lay, it\xc3\x95s ridge sloping towards the river \ron the left, straining at it from the right, loosening its deepest\rroots, and tearing it out, then suddenly hurling it away, \rthe highest heavens thundered with the blow,\rthe banks broke apart, and the terrified river recoiled.\rBut Cacus\xc3\x95s den and his vast realm stood revealed,\rand the shadowy caverns within lay open,\rno differently than if earth, gaping deep within, \rwere to unlock the infernal regions by force, and disclose\rthe pallid realms, hated by the gods, and the vast abyss\rbe seen from above, and the spirits tremble at incoming light.\rSo Hercules, calling upon all his weapons, hurled missiles \rat Cacus from above, caught suddenly in unexpected daylight, \rpenned in the hollow rock, with unaccustomed howling, \rand rained boughs and giant blocks of stone on him.\rHe on the other hand, since there was no escape now \rfrom the danger, belched thick smoke from his throat \r(marvellous to tell) and enveloped the place in blind darkness,\rblotting the view from sight, and gathering \rsmoke-laden night in the cave, a darkness mixed with fire.\rHercules in his pride could not endure it, and he threw himself,\rwith a headlong leap, through the flames, where the smoke\rgave out its densest billows, and black mist heaved in the great cavern.\rHere, as Cacus belched out useless flame in the darkness,\rHercules seized him in a knot-like clasp, and, clinging, choked him\rthe eyes squeezed, and the throat drained of blood.\rImmediately the doors were ripped out, and the dark den exposed,\rthe stolen cattle, and the theft Cacus denied, were revealed \rto the heavens, and the shapeless carcass dragged out \rby the feet. The people could not get their fill of gazing\rat the hideous eyes, the face, and shaggy bristling chest\rof the half-man, and the ashes of the jaw\xc3\x95s flames.\rBecause of that this rite is celebrated, and happy posterity\rremembers the day: and Potitius, the first, the founder, with \rthe Pinarian House as guardians of the worship of Hercules,\rset up this altar in the grove, which shall be spoken of for ever\rby us as \xc3\x94The Mightiest\xc3\x95, and the mightiest it shall be for ever.\rCome now, O you young men, wreathe your hair with leaves,\rhold out wine-cups in your right hands, in honour of such great glory,\rand call on the god we know, and pour out the wine with a will.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke, while grey-green poplar veiled his hair \rwith Hercules\xc3\x95s own shade, hanging down in a knot of leaves, \rand the sacred cup filled his hand. Quickly they all poured \ra joyful libation on the table, and prayed to the gods.\rMeanwhile, evening drew nearer in the heavens,\rand now the priests went out, Potitius leading,\rclothed in pelts as customary, and carrying torches.\rThey restarted the feast, bringing welcome offerings\ras a second course, and piled the altars with heaped plates.\rThen the Salii, the dancing priests, came to sing round \rthe lighted altars, their foreheads wreathed with sprays\rof poplar, one band of youths, another of old men, who praised\rthe glories and deeds of Hercules in song: how as an infant he strangled\rthe twin snakes in his grip, monsters sent by Juno his stepmother:\rhow too he destroyed cities incomparable in war,\rTroy and Oechalia: how he endured a thousand hard labours\rdestined for him by cruel Juno, through King Eurystheus:\r\xc3\x94You, unconquerable one, you slew the cloud-born Centaurs,\rbi-formed Hylaeus and Pholus, with your hand: the monstrous\rCretan Bull: and the huge lion below the cliffs of Nemea.\rThe Stygian Lake trembled before you: Cerberus, Hell\xc3\x95s guardian,\rlying on half-eaten bones in his blood-drenched cave:\rNo shape, not Typheus himself, armed and towering \rupwards, daunted you: your brains were not lacking \rwhen Lerna\xc3\x95s Hydra surrounded you with its swarm of heads.\rHail, true child of Jove, a glory added to the gods,\rvisit us and your rites with grace and favouring feet.\xc3\x95\rSuch things they celebrated in song, adding to all this\rCacus\xc3\x95s cave, and the fire-breather himself.\rAll the grove rang with sound, and the hills echoed.\r  \rBKVIII:306-369 PALLANTEUM \xc3\x90 THE SITE OF ROME\r\rThen they all returned to the city, the sacred rites complete.\rThe king walked clothed with years, and kept Aeneas and his son\rnear him for company, lightening the road with various talk.\rAeneas marvelled, and scanned his eyes about \reagerly, captivated by the place, and delighted \rto enquire about and learn each tale of the men of old.\rSo King Evander, founder of Rome\xc3\x95s citadel, said:\r\xc3\x94The local Nymphs and Fauns once lived in these groves,\rand a race of men born of trees with tough timber,\rwho had no laws or culture, and didn\xc3\x95t know how \rto yoke oxen or gather wealth, or lay aside a store, \rbut the branches fed them, and the hunter\xc3\x95s wild fare.\rSaturn was the first to come down from heavenly Olympus,\rfleeing Jove\xc3\x95s weapons, and exiled from his lost realm.\rHe gathered together the untaught race, scattered among\rthe hills, and gave them laws, and chose to call it Latium,\rfrom latere, \xc3\x94to hide\xc3\x95, since he had hidden in safety on these shores.\rUnder his reign was the Golden Age men speak of:\rin such tranquil peace did he rule the nations,\runtil little by little an inferior, tarnished age succeeded,\rwith war\xc3\x95s madness, and desire for possessions.\rThen the Ausonian bands came, and the Siconian tribes,\rwhile Saturn\xc3\x95s land of Latium often laid aside her name:\rthen the kings, and savage Thybris, of vast bulk,\rafter whom we Italians call our river by the name \rof Tiber: the ancient Albula has lost her true name.\rAs for me, exiled from my country and seeking \rthe limits of the ocean, all-powerful Chance, \rand inescapable fate, settled me in this place,\rdriven on by my mother the Nymph Carmentis\xc3\x95s \rdire warnings, and my guardian god Apollo.\xc3\x95\rHe had scarcely spoken when advancing he pointed out\rthe altar and what the Romans call the Carmental Gate,\rin ancient tribute to the Nymph Carmentis, \rthe far-seeing prophetess, who first foretold\rthe greatness of Aeneas\xc3\x95s sons, the glory of Pallanteum.\rNext he pointed to a vast grove, which brave Romulus would restore \ras a sanctuary, and the Lupercal, the Wolf\xc3\x95s Cave, under a cold cliff,\rnamed in the Arcadian way for the wolf-god, Lycaean Pan.\rAnd he also pointed out the grove of sacred Argiletum\rcalling the place to witness, relating the death of Argus his guest. \rHe leads him from here to the Tarpeian Rock and the Capitol,\rnow all gold, once bristling with wild thorns.\rEven then the dreadful holiness of the place awed the fearful \rcountry folk, even then they trembled at the wood and the rock.\r\xc3\x94A god inhabits this grove,\xc3\x95 he said, \xc3\x94 and this hill with its leafy summit,\r(which god is unknown): my Arcadians believe they have seen\rJove himself, as his right hand has often shaken\rhis darkening shield, and called up the storm clouds.\rMoreover you can see in these two townships \rwith broken walls, the memorials and relics of men of old. \rFather Janus built this fort, Saturn that:\rthis was named the Janiculum, that the Saturnia.\xc3\x95\rTalking among themselves they came to the house\rof the impoverished Evander, and saw cattle here and there, lowing\rwhere the Roman Forum and the fashionable Carinae would be.\rWhen they reached the house, Evander said: \xc3\x94Victorious Hercules\rstooped to entering this doorway, this palace charmed him.\rMy guest, dare to scorn wealth, and make yourself worthy too\rto be a god: don\xc3\x95t be scathing about the lack of possessions.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke, and led mighty Aeneas beneath the confines \rof his sloping roof, and allotted him a mattress \rstuffed with leaves, and the pelt of a Libyan bear:\rNight fell, and embraced the earth with her darkening wings.\r\rBKVIII:370-406 VENUS SEEKS WEAPONS FROM VULCAN\r\rNow Venus, a mother fearful, and not without reason, in her mind,\rtroubled by the Laurentine threats, and fierce uprising,\rspoke to Vulcan, her husband, in their golden bridal chamber,\rbeginning this way, breathing divine passion into her words:\r\r\r\r\r\r\rVenus Ordering Arms from Vulcan for Aeneas\rJean Restout (France, 1692-1768)\rLACMA Collections\r\r\n\r\xc3\x94I didn\xc3\x95t ask weapons of your skill or power, dearest husband,\rnor any help for my poor people, while the Argive kings\rdestroyed doomed Troy in the war, her citadel fated\rto fall to hostile flames: no, I didn\xc3\x95t want to exercise\ryou or your skills in vain, though I owed much indeed\rto Priam\xc3\x95s sons, and often wept at Aeneas\xc3\x95s cruel suffering.\rNow at Jove\xc3\x95s command he has set foot on Rutulian shores,\rso I come likewise as a suppliant and ask arms of the power\rsacred to me, a mother on behalf of her son. Thetis, Nereus\xc3\x95s\rdaughter, and Aurora, Tithonus\xc3\x95s wife, could move you with tears.\rSee what nations gather, what cities, closing their gates, \rare sharpening their swords against me, to destroy my people.\xc3\x95\rShe had spoken, and as he hesitated, the goddess caressed him\rin a tender embrace, on this side and on that, in her snowy arms.\rAt once he felt the familiar flame, and that warmth he knew\rpenetrated him to the marrow, and ran through his melting bones,\rno differently than when, with a peal of thunder, a forked \rstreak of fire tears through the storm-clouds with dazzling light:\rhis partner felt it, delighted with her cleverness and conscious\rof her beauty. Then old Vulcan spoke, chained by immortal love:\r\xc3\x94Why do you seek instances from the past? Goddess, where \rhas your faith in me gone? If your anxiety then was the same,\rit would have been right for me too to arm the Trojans then:\rneither fate nor the almighty Father refused to let Troy stand,\ror Priam live, ten years more. And so now, if war is your intent,\rand your mind is set on it, cease to doubt your powers, entreating\rwhatever care I can promise in my craft, whatever can be made \rof iron and molten electrum, whatever fire and air can do.\xc3\x95\rSaying these words he gave her a desired embrace, and sinking\ronto his wife\xc3\x95s breast, sought gentle sleep in every limb.\r\rBKVIII:407-453 VULCAN\xc3\x95S SMITHY\r\rWhen, in vanishing night\xc3\x95s mid-course, first rest \rhas conquered the need for sleep: when a woman, \rwho supports life with distaff and the humble work\rMinerva imposes, first wakes the ashes, and slumbering flames,\radding night hours to her toil, and maintains her servants\rat their endless task, by lamplight, to keep her husband\xc3\x95s bed\rpure, and raise her young sons: just so, the god, \rwith the power of fire, rose now from his soft bed, \rno idler at that hour, to labour at the forge.\rAn island, its rocks smoking, rises steeply by\rthe Sicilian coast, near the flanks of Aeolian Lipare.\rBeneath it a cave, and the galleries of Etna, eaten at\rby the Cyclopean furnaces, resound, and the groans from\rthe anvils are heard echoing the heavy blows,\rand masses of Chalybean steel hiss in the caverns,\rand fire breathes through the furnaces. It is Vulcan\xc3\x95s home \rand called Vulcania. Here then the god \rwith the power of fire descended from the heavens.\rIn the huge cave the Cyclopes, Brontes, Steropes, \rand bare-limbed Pyrcamon, were forging iron.\rThey held a lightning-bolt, shaped with their hands, \rlike many of those the Father hurls from all over\rthe sky, part of it polished, part still left to do.\rThey\xc3\x95d added three shafts of spiralling rain, three of watery\rcloud, three of reddening fire, and the winged south wind.\rnow they were blending terrifying flashes, into the work,\rsounds and fears, and fury with following flames.\rElsewhere they pressed on with a chariot for Mars, with winged wheels,\rwith which he rouses men, with which he rouses cities:\rand a chilling aegis, the breastplate of  Pallas,\rcompeting to burnish its serpent scales of gold,\rits interwoven snakes, and the Gorgon herself\ron the goddess\xc3\x95s breast, with severed neck and rolling eyes:\r\xc3\x94Away with all this,\xc3\x95 he shouts, \xc3\x94remove the work \ryou\xc3\x95ve started, Cyclopes of Etna, and turn your minds to this:\ryou\xc3\x95re to make arms for a brave hero. Now you \rneed strength, swift hands now, all the art now of a master.\rAn end to delay.\xc3\x95 He said no more, but they all \rbent quickly to the toil, and shared the labour equally.\rBronze and golden ore flowed in streams, \rand steel, that deals wounds, melted in a vast furnace.\rThey shaped a giant shield, one to stand against all\rthe weapons of Latium, layering it seven times,\rdisc on disc. Some sucked in air and blew it out\ragain with panting bellows, others dipped the hissing bronze\rin the lake: the cavern groaned beneath the weight of anvils.\rWith mighty force they lifted their arms together in rhythm,\rand turned the mass of metal, gripping it with pincers.\r\rBKVIII:454-519 EVANDER PROPOSES ASSISTANCE\r\rWhile the lord of Lemnos hastened the work on the Aeolian\rshore, the kindly light, and the dawn song of the birds\rbeneath the eaves, called Evander from his humble house.\rThe old man rose, clothed his body in a tunic\rand strapped Tyrrhenian sandals to the soles of his feet.\rThen he fastened his Tegaean sword over his shoulder \rand to his side, flinging back a panther\xc3\x95s hide on the left.\rTwo guard dogs besides ran ahead from the high\rthreshold, and accompanied their master\xc3\x95s steps.\rThe hero made his way to his guest Aeneas\xc3\x95s\rsecluded lodging, thinking of his words, \rand the help he had promised. Aeneas was no less\rearly to rise: his son Pallas walked with the one, \rAchates with the other. They clasped hands as they met, \rsat down among the houses, and finally enjoyed \ropen conversation. The king was the first to begin, so:\r\xc3\x94Greatest leader of the Teucrians, for my part while you\xc3\x95re safe\rand sound I\xc3\x95ll never accept that the kingdom and power of Troy \rhave been overthrown, our strength in war is inadequate to such \ra name: on this side we are shut in by the Tuscan river, while on that\rthe Rutulian presses us, and thunders in arms round our walls. \rBut I propose to affiliate mighty peoples to you, \rand a war-camp rich in kingships, help that chance \runpredictably reveals. You arrive at fate\xc3\x95s command. \rNot far from here is the site of Argylla\xc3\x95s city, \rbuilt of ancient stone, where the Lydian race, \rfamous in war, once settled the Etruscan heights.\rFor many years it flourished, until King Mezentius\rruled it with arrogant power, and savage weaponry. \rWhy recount the tyrant\xc3\x95s wicked murders and vicious acts?\rMay the gods reserve such for his life and race!\rHe even tied corpses to living bodies, as a means\rof torture, placing hand on hand and face against face,\rso killing by a lingering death, in that wretched\rembrace, that ooze of disease and decomposition.\rBut the weary citizens at last armed themselves\rsurrounded the atrocious madman in his palace,\rmowed down his supporters, and fired the roof.\rAmongst the carnage he escaped and fled \rto Rutulian soil, protected by Turnus\xc3\x95s allied army.\rSo all Etruria has risen in rightful anger, demanding \rthe king for punishment, with the threat of immediate war.\rAeneas, I\xc3\x95ll make you leader of those thousands.\rFor their ships clamour densely on the shore,\rand they order the banners to advance, but an aged\rsoothsayer holds them back, singing of destiny:\r\xc3\x94O chosen warriors of Maeonia, the flower, the honour\rof our ancient race, whom just resentment sends against\rthe enemy, and whom Mezentius fires with rightful anger,\rno man of Italy may control such a people as you: choose\rforeigners as leaders.\xc3\x95 So the Etruscan ranks camped \ron that plain, fearful of this warning from the gods.\rTarchon himself has sent ambassadors to me, with the royal \rsceptre and crown, entrusting me with the insignia:\rI to come to the camp, and take the Tuscan throne.\rBut the slow frost of old age wearied by the years, and strength\rnow beyond acts of valour, begrudge me the command. \rI would urge my son to it, except that of mixed blood \rwith a Sabine mother, he takes part of his nationality from her. \rYou, O bravest leader of Trojans and Italians, to whose race \rand years destiny is favourable, whom the divine will calls, \raccept. Moreover I\xc3\x95ll add Pallas here, our hope and comfort:\rlet him become accustomed under your guidance \rto endure military service, and the grave work of war, \rwitness your actions, and admire you from his early years.\rI\xc3\x95ll grant him two hundred Arcadian horsemen, the choice flower \rof our manhood, and Pallas will grant the same to you himself.\xc3\x95\r\rBKVIII:520-584 THE PRELIMINARY ALARMS\r\rHe had scarcely finished, and Aeneas, Anchises\xc3\x95s son,\rand loyal Achates, with eyes downcast, were thinking\rof many a difficulty, in their own sombre minds,\rwhen Cytherea sent a sign from a cloudless sky.\rFor lightning came flashing unexpectedly from heaven,\rwith thunder, and suddenly all seemed to quake,\rand, through the air, a Tyrrhenian trumpet blast seemed to bray.\rThey looked upwards, a great crash sounded again and again.\rIn a calm region of the sky among the clouds they saw\rweapons reddening in the bright air, and heard the noise of blows.\rThe others were astounded but the Trojan hero knew\rthe sounds as those of things which his mother had promised.\rThen he cried: \xc3\x94My friend, indeed, do not wonder I beg you\ras to what these marvels might prophesy: I am called \rby Olympus. The goddess who bore me foretold \rshe would send this sign if war was near, and bring\rweapons from Vulcan through the air to aid me.\rAlas what slaughter awaits the wretched Laurentines!\rWhat a price you\xc3\x95ll pay me, Turnus! What shields and helmets\rand bodies of the brave you\xc3\x95ll roll beneath your waves, \rfather Tiber! Let them ask for battle and break their treaties.\xc3\x95\rHaving spoken, he raised himself from his high throne, \rand firstly revived the dormant altars with Herculean fire, \rthen gladly visited yesterday\xc3\x95s Lar and the humble \rhousehold gods. Evander and the Trojan warriors\requally sacrificed chosen ewes according to the rite.\rNext he went to the ships and met again with his comrades,\rchoosing the most outstanding in courage to follow him\rto war: the others slipped downstream, floating effortlessly \ron the helpful current, carrying news to Ascanius\rof his father and his fortunes. Horses were granted \rto the Trojans who were to take the Tyrrhenian field:\rThey lead out a choice mount for Aeneas, clothed\rin a tawny lion\xc3\x95s pelt with gleaming gilded claws.\rA rumour suddenly flew through the little town, proclaiming\rthat horsemen were riding fast to the Tyrrhene king\xc3\x95s shores.\rMothers, in alarm, redoubled their prayers, and fear drew near\rwith danger, and now the war god\xc3\x95s image loomed larger.\rThen old Evander, clasping his son\xc3\x95s hand as he departed,\rclung to him weeping incessantly and spoke as follows:\r\xc3\x94O, if Jupiter would bring back the years that have vanished,\rI to be as I was when I felled the foremost ranks under Praeneste\xc3\x95s\rvery walls, and as victor heaped up the shields,\rand sent King Erulus down to Tartarus, by this right hand,\rhe to whom at his birth his mother Feronia (strange to tell)\rgave three lives, triple weapons to wield \xc3\x90 to be three times\rbrought low in death: who at last in a moment this right hand \rstripped of all his lives, and equally of all his weapons:\rI would never be torn as now from your sweet embrace, my son,\rnever would Mezentius have poured insults on \rthis neighbour\xc3\x95s head, caused so many cruel deaths \rwith the sword, or widowed the city of so many of her sons.\rBut you, powers above, and you, Jupiter, mighty ruler of the gods,\rtake pity I beg you on this Arcadian king, and hear \ra father\xc3\x95s prayer. If your will, and fate, keep my Pallas safe,\rif I live to see him and be together with him, I ask for life: \rI have the patience to endure any hardship.\rBut if you threaten any unbearable disaster, Fortune,\rnow, oh now, let me break the thread of cruel existence,\rwhile fear hangs in doubt, while hope\xc3\x95s uncertain of the future.\rwhile you, beloved boy, my late and only joy, are held \rin my embrace, and let no evil news wound my ears.\xc3\x95 \rThese were the words the father poured out at their last parting:\rthen his servants carried him, overcome, into the palace.\r\rBKVIII:585-625 VENUS\xc3\x95S GIFT OF ARMOUR\r\rAnd now the horsemen had ridden from the opened gates,\rAeneas, and loyal Achetes, among the first: then the other\rprinces of Troy, Pallas himself travelling mid-column,\rnotable in his cloak and engraved armour,\rlike the Morning-Star, whom Venus loves above all\rthe other starry fires, when, having bathed in Ocean\xc3\x95s wave,\rhe raises his sacred head in heaven, and melts the dark.\rMothers stand fearfully on the battlements, and with their eyes\rfollow the cloud of dust, the squadrons bright with bronze.\rThe armed men pass through the undergrowth where the route\ris most direct: a shout rises, and they form column,\rand with the thunder of their hooves shake the broken ground.\rThere\xc3\x95s a large grove by the chilly stream of Caere, held sacred\rfar and wide, in ancestral reverence: the hollow hills enclose it\ron all sides, and surround the wood with dark fir trees.\rThe tale is that the ancient Pelasgians, who once held\rthe Latin borders, dedicated this wood and a festive day\rto Silvanus, god of the fields and the herds. \rNot far from here, Tarchon and the Tyrrhenians were camped\rin a safe place, and now all their troops could be seen, \rfrom the high ground, scattered widely over the fields.\rAeneas, the leader, and the young men chosen for war,\rarrived, and refreshed their horses and their weary bodies. \rThen Venus, bright goddess, came bearing gifts through\rthe ethereal clouds: and when she saw her son from far away\rwho had retired in secret to the valley by the cool stream,\rshe went to him herself, unasked, and spoke these words:\r\xc3\x94See the gifts brought to perfection by my husband\xc3\x95s\rskill, as promised. You need not hesitate, my son, to quickly \rchallenge the proud Laurentines, or fierce Turnus, to battle.\xc3\x95\rCytherea spoke, and invited her son\xc3\x95s embrace, and placed\rthe shining weapons under an oak tree opposite.\rHe cannot have enough of turning his gaze over each item,\rdelighting in the goddess\xc3\x95s gift and so high an honour,\radmiring, and turning the helmet over with hands and arms,\rwith its fearsome crest and spouting flames,\rand the fateful sword, the stiff breastplate of bronze,\rdark-red and huge, like a bluish cloud when it\xc3\x95s lit\rby the rays of the sun, and glows from afar:\rthen the smooth greaves, of electrum and refined gold,\rthe spear, and the shield\xc3\x95s indescribable detail.\r\rBKVIII:626-670 VULCAN\xc3\x95S SHIELD: SCENES OF EARLY ROME\r\rThere the lord with the power of fire, not unversed\rin prophecy, and knowledge of the centuries to come,\rhad fashioned the history of Italy, and Rome\xc3\x95s triumphs:\rthere was every future generation of Ascanius\xc3\x95s stock,\rand the sequence of battles they were to fight. \rHe had also shown the she-wolf, having just littered,\rlying on the ground, in the green cave of Mars,\rthe twin brothers, Romulus and Remus, playing, hanging\ron her teats, and fearlessly sucking at their foster-mother.\rBending her neck back smoothly she caressed them\rin turn, and licked their limbs with her tongue.\rNot far from that he had placed Rome, the Sabine women,\rlawlessly snatched from the seated crowd, when the great games \rwere held in the Circus: and the sudden surge of fresh warfare\rbetween Romulus\xc3\x95s men, and the aged Tatius and his austere Cures.\rNext, the same two kings stood armed in front of Jove\xc3\x95s altar,\rholding the wine-cups and joined in league, sacrificing a sow,\rthe new-built palace bristling with Romulus\xc3\x95s thatch.\rThen, not far from that, four-horse chariots driven \rin different directions tore Mettus apart (Alban, you should\rhave kept your word, though!), and Tullus dragged the liar\xc3\x95s\rentrails through the woods, the briars wet with sprinkled blood.\rThere was Porsenna too, ordering Rome to admit the banished\rTarquin, and gripping the city in a mighty siege:\rthe scions of Aeneas running on the sword for freedom\xc3\x95s sake.\rYou could see Porsenna in angry, and in threatening, posture,\rbecause Cocles dared to tear down the bridge,\rbecause Cloelia broke her restraints and swam the river.\rAt the top Manlius, guardian of the Tarpeian Citadel,\rstood before the temple, defending the high Capitol.\rAnd there the silvery goose, flying through the gilded\rcolonnades, cackled that the Gauls were at the gate.\rThe Gauls were there in the gorse, taking the Citadel,\rprotected by the dark, the gift of shadowy night.\rTheir hair was gold, and their clothes were gold,\rthey shone in striped cloaks, their white necks\rtorqued with gold, each waving two Alpine javelins\rin his hand, long shields defending their bodies.\rHere he had beaten out the leaping Salii and naked Luperci,\rthe woolly priest\xc3\x95s caps, and the oval shields that fell\rfrom heaven, chaste mothers in cushioned carriages\rleading sacred images through the city. Far from these\rhe had added the regions of Tartarus, the high gates of Dis,\rthe punishment for wickedness, and you Catiline, hanging\rfrom a threatening cliff, trembling at the sight of the Furies:\rand the good, at a distance, Cato handing out justice.\r\rBKVIII:671-713 VULCAN\xc3\x95S SHIELD: THE BATTLE OF ACTIUM\r\rThe likeness of the swollen sea flowed everywhere among these, \rin gold, though the flood foamed with white billows,\rand dolphins in bright silver swept the waters \rround about with arching tails, and cut through the surge.\rIn the centre bronze ships could be seen, the Battle of Actium,\rand you could make out all Leucate in feverish\rpreparation for war, the waves gleaming with gold.\rOn one side Augustus Caesar stands on the high stern, \rleading the Italians to the conflict, with him the Senate,\rthe People, the household gods, the great gods, his happy brow \rshoots out twin flames, and his father\xc3\x95s star is shown on his head.\rElsewhere Agrippa, favoured by the winds and the gods\rleads his towering column of ships, his brow shines \rwith the beaks of the naval crown, his proud battle distinction.\rOn the other side Antony, with barbarous wealth and strange weapons,\rconqueror of eastern peoples and the Indian shores, bringing Egypt, \rand the might of the Orient, with him, and furthest Bactria:\rand his Egyptian consort follows him (the shame).\rAll press forward together, and the whole sea foams, \rchurned by the sweeping oars and the trident rams.\rThey seek deep water: you\xc3\x95d think the Cycladic islands were uprooted \rand afloat on the flood, or high mountains clashed with mountains,\rso huge the mass with which the men attack the towering sterns.\rBlazing tow and missiles of winged steel shower from their hands,\rNeptune\xc3\x95s fields grow red with fresh slaughter.\rThe queen in the centre signals to her columns with the native \rsistrum, not yet turning to look at the twin snakes at her back.\rBarking Anubis, and monstrous gods of every kind\rbrandish weapons against Neptune, Venus, \rand Minerva.

To him Thaumas\xc3\x95s daughter spoke, from her rosy lips:\r\xc3\x94Turnus, see, the circling days, unasked, have brought\rwhat you wished, but what no god dared to promise.\rAeneas leaving the city, his friends and ships,\rseeks the Palatine kingdom, and Evander\xc3\x95s house.\rUnsatisfied he has reached Corythus\xc3\x95s furthest cities,\rand, gathering men from the country, arms Lydian troops.\rWhy wait? Now is the time to call on horse and chariot.\rEnd all delays: seize their camp, in its confusion.\xc3\x95\rShe spoke, and rose into the sky on level wings,\rtracing a vast arc against the clouds in her flight.\rThe youth knew her, raised both his hands to the heavens,\rand sent these words after her as she flew:\r\xc3\x94Iris, glory of the sky, who sent you down through\rthe clouds, to me, on earth? Where does this sudden \rbright moment spring from? I see the sky split apart\rat its zenith, and the stars that roam the pole. I follow\rso mighty an omen, whoever calls me to arms.\xc3\x95\rSaying this he went to the river and scooped water\rfrom the surface of the stream, calling often\rto the gods, and weighting the air with prayers.\r\r\rBKIX:25-76 TURNUS ATTACKS THE TROJAN FLEET\r\rNow the whole army, rich in horses, rich in ornate clothes, \rand gold, was engaged in moving over the open fields: \rMessapus controlling the front ranks, Tyrrhus\xc3\x95s sons\rthe rear, Turnus, the leader, in the centre of the line:\rlike the deep Ganges, swelling in silence, through \rhis seven placid streams, or Nile when his rich stream \rinundates the fields, soon sinking down into his course.\rThe Trojans suddenly see a black dust cloud \rgathering there, and darkness rising over the plain.\rCaicus shouted first from the forward rampart:\r\xc3\x94What\xc3\x95s that rolling mass of black fog, countrymen?\rBring your swords, quickly: hand out spears: mount the walls:\rah, the enemy is here!\xc3\x95 With a great clamour the Trojans\rretreated through the gates, and filled the ramparts.\rFor Aeneas, wisest in warfare, had commanded, on leaving,\rif anything chanced in the meantime, they were not to dare\rto form ranks or trust themselves to the open field: they were\ronly to guard the camp and walls, safe behind the ramparts.\rSo, though anger and shame counselled the troops to fight,\rstill they shut the gates and followed his orders,\rawaiting the enemy, armed, within their hollow turrets.\rBut Turnus had galloped forward ahead of his slow column,\raccompanied by twenty chosen horsemen, and reached\rthe city unexpectedly: a piebald Thracian horse carried him,\ra golden helmet with a crimson crest protected his head.\r\xc3\x94Men,\xc3\x95 he shouted, \xc3\x94is there anyone who\xc3\x95ll be first with me\ramong the enemy \xc3\x90 ? Look,\xc3\x95 and twirling a javelin sent it\rskyward to start the fight, and rode proudly over the field.\rHis friends welcomed him with a shout, and followed \rwith fearful battle-cries: marvelling at the Trojan\xc3\x95s dull souls,\rnot trusting themselves to a level field, nor facing men \rcarrying weapons, but hugging the camp. He rode to and fro\rwildly round the walls, seeking a way in where there was none.\rLike a wolf, lying in wait by a full sheepfold, that snarls\rby the pens at midnight, enduring the wind and rain,\rthe lambs bleating safe beneath their mothers, \rand rages against the prey out of reach, fierce and persistent\rin its anger, tormented by its dry, bloodless jaws,\rand the fierceness of its long-increasing hunger:\rso as Turnus scanned the wall and camp, the Rutulian\xc3\x95s anger\rwas alight, and indignation burned in his harsh marrow.\rHow could he try and enter, and hurl the penned-up \rTrojans from their rampart, and scatter them over the plain?\rHe attacked the ships, that lay close to a flank of the camp,\rdefended by earthworks, and the flowing river,\rcalling out to his exultant friends for fire,\rand fervently grasped a blazing pine-brand in his hand.\rThen they set to (urged on by Turnus\xc3\x95s presence)\rand all the men armed themselves with dark torches.\rThey stripped the hearths: the smoking branches threw\ra pitchy glow, and Vulcan hurled the cloud of ashes to heaven.\r\rBKIX:77-106 CYBELE MAKES A PLEA TO JOVE\r\rO Muse, what god, turned away such fierce flames \rfrom the Trojans? Who drove such savage fires from the ships?\rTell me: belief in the story\xc3\x95s ancient, its fame is eternal.\rIn the days when Aeneas first built his fleet on Phrygian Ida\rand prepared to set out over the deep ocean,\rthey say the Mother of the gods herself, Berecyntian Cybele,\rspoke so to great Jupiter: \xc3\x94My son, lord of Olympus, \rgrant what your dear mother asks of you in request.\rThere was a pine-forest a delight to me for many years\ra grove on the summit of the mountain, where they brought\rofferings, dark with blackened firs and maple trunks.\rI gave these gladly to the Trojan youth, since he lacked\ra fleet: now, troubled, anxious fear torments me.\rRelieve my fears, and let your mother by her prayers ensure\rthey are not destroyed, shattered by voyaging or violent storm:\rlet their origin on our mountain be of aid to them.\xc3\x95\rHer son, who turns the starry globe, replied: \r\xc3\x94O, my mother, to what do you summon fate? What do you seek \rfor them? Should keels made by mortal hands have eternal rights?\rShould Aeneas travel in certainty through uncertain\rdangers? To what god are such powers permitted?\rNo, one day when they\xc3\x95ve served their purpose, \rand reached an Italian haven, I\xc3\x95ll take away, from those\rthat escape the waves, and bear the Trojan chief \rto Laurentine fields, their mortal shape, and command \rthem to be goddesses  of the vast ocean, like Doto, Nereus\xc3\x95s\rchild, and Galatea, who part the foaming sea with their breasts.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke, and swore his assent, by his Stygian brother\xc3\x95s rivers,\rby the banks that seethe with pitch on the black abyss,\rand with his nod shook all Olympus.\r\rBKIX:107-122 CYBELE TRANSFORMS THE SHIPS\r\rSo the day he had promised came, and the Fates fulfilled\rtheir appointed hour, when Turnus\xc3\x95s injury to the sacred fleet\rprompted the Mother to defend them from the flames. \rAt first a strange light flared to the watchers, and a huge cloud\rwas seen to travel across the sky from the east,\rwith bands of her Idaean attendants: then a terrible voice\rrang through the air, echoing among the Trojan and Rutulian lines:\r\xc3\x94Trojans, don\xc3\x95t rush to defend the ships, or take up arms.\rTurnus can burn the ocean, sooner than my sacred pines. Go free,\ryou Goddesses of the sea: your mother commands it.\xc3\x95 And at once\reach ship tore her cable loose from the bank: they dipped their noses\rlike dolphins, and sought the watery deep. Then (strange wonder)\ras many virgin shapes re-surfaced, and swam about the sea.\r\rBKIX:123-167 TURNUS LAYS SIEGE TO THE CAMP\r\rThe Rutulians were amazed in mind, Messapus himself\rwas awe-struck, his horses panicked: and even the noisy flow\rof the river halted, as Tiber retreated from the deep.\rBut brave Turnus\xc3\x95s confidence never wavered:\rand he raised their spirits as well, and chided them:\r\xc3\x94These marvels are aimed at the Trojans, Jupiter himself\rhas deprived them of their usual allies: those didn\xc3\x95t wait\rfor Rutulian missiles and fires. So the seas are impassable\rfor the Trojans, and they have no hope of flight: other regions\rare lost to them, and this land is in our hands, so many\rthousands of Italy\xc3\x95s peoples are in arms. I\xc3\x95m not afraid\rof all the fateful omens from the gods these Phrygians \ropenly boast of: enough has been granted to Venus and the Fates,\rsince the Trojans have reached Ausonia\xc3\x95s fertile fields.\rI have my own counter destiny, to root out the guilty race,\rthat has snatched my bride, with the sword. That\xc3\x95s a sorrow\rthat doesn\xc3\x95t touch Atrides alone, nor is Mycenae alone allowed\rto take up arms. \xc3\x94But to die once is enough.\xc3\x95? To have sinned\rbefore should be enough for these men, to whom confidence \rin a dividing wall, and slight obstacles to death, defensive moats,\rgrant courage, to utterly detest well-nigh the whole tribe \rof women. Did they not witness the work of Neptune\xc3\x95s \rhands, the battlements of Troy, sink in flames? But you, \rO chosen ones, which of you is ready to uproot the ramparts\rwith your steel, and invade their terrified camp with me?\rI don\xc3\x95t need Vulcan\xc3\x95s arms, or a thousand ships,\ragainst Trojans. Let all Etruria join them now in alliance.\rThey need not fear darkness, or cowardly theft\r\xc3\x94of their Palladium, killing guards on the citadel\xc3\x95s heights\xc3\x95,\rwe won\xc3\x95t hide in the dark belly of a horse:\rI intend to circle their walls in broad daylight with fire.\rI\xc3\x95ll make them concede its not Greeks, Pelasgic youth,\rthey\xc3\x95re dealing with, whom Hector held till the tenth year.\rNow, since the best part of the day\xc3\x95s gone, men, \rrefresh yourselves with what\xc3\x95s left, pleased with work\rwell done, and look forward to starting the battle.\rMeanwhile the order was given to Messapus to picket\rthe gates alertly with sentries and ring the ramparts with flames.\rFourteen Rutulians were chosen to guard the walls\rwith their men, each with a hundred soldiers \runder them, purple-plumed and glittering with gold. \rThey ran about, took turns on watch, or lifted \rthe bronze bowls and enjoyed their wine, \rstretched out on the grass. The fires shone, \rwhile the guards spent the watchful night in games. \r\rBKIX:168-223 NISUS AND EURYALUS: A MISSION PROPOSED\r\rThe armed Trojans held the heights, looking down \ron this from above, and also with anxious fears, \rchecked the gates, built bulwarks and bridges, \rand disposed their weapons. Mnestheus and brave Serestus,\rwhom Aeneas their leader appointed to command the army\rand state, if adversity ever required it, urged them on. \rSharing the risk, the whole company kept watch and served\rin turn, at whatever point was to be guarded by each.\rNisus, bravest of warriors, son of Hyrtacus, was a guard\rat the gates, he whom Ida the huntress had sent \rto accompany Aeneas, agile with javelin and light darts,\rand Euryalus was with him, than whom none was \rmore beautiful among the Aenedae, or wearing Trojan armour,\ra boy, whose unshaven face, showed the first bloom of youth.\rOne love was theirs, and they charged side by side into battle:\rnow they were also guarding the gate at the same sentry-post. \rNisus said: \xc3\x94Euryalus, do the gods set this fire in our hearts,\ror does each man\xc3\x95s fatal desire become godlike to him?\rMy mind has long urged me to rush to battle, or high\radventure, and is not content with peace and quiet.\rYou see what confidence the Rutulians have in events:\rtheir lights shine far apart, and they lie drowned in sleep\rand wine, everywhere is quiet. Listen to what I\xc3\x95m now\rthinking, and what purpose comes to mind. The army\rand the council all demand Aeneas be recalled, \rand men be sent to report the facts to him.\rIf they were to grant what I suggest to you (the glory \rof doing it is enough for me) I think I could find a way, \rbeyond that hill, to the walls and ramparts of Pallanteum.\xc3\x95\rEuryalus was dazzled, struck by a great desire for glory,\rand replied to his ardent friend at once, like this:\r\xc3\x94Nisus, do you shun my joining in this great deed,\r then? Shall I send you into such danger alone?\rThat\xc3\x95s not how my father Opheltes, seasoned in war,\reducated me, raising me among Greek terrors \rand Troy\xc3\x95s ordeals, nor have I conducted myself so\rwith you, following noble Aeneas and the ends of fate.\rThis is my spirit, one scornful of the day, that thinks\rthe honour you aim at well bought with life itself.\xc3\x95\rNisus replied: \xc3\x94Indeed I had no such doubts of you,\rthat would be wrong: not so will great Jupiter, or whoever\rlooks at this action with favourable gaze, bring me back to you\rin triumph: but if (as you often see in such crises) \rif chance or some god sweeps me to disaster,\rI want you to survive: your youth is more deserving of life.\rLet there be someone to entrust me to earth, my body\rrescued from conflict, or ransomed for a price,\ror if Fortune denies the customary rites, to perform \rthem in my absence, and honour me with a stone.\rAnd don\xc3\x95t let me be a cause of grief to your poor mother,\rmy boy, who alone among many mothers dared to follow \ryou, without thought of staying in great Acestes\xc3\x95s city.\xc3\x95\rBut the lad said: \xc3\x94You weave your excuses in vain,\rmy purpose won\xc3\x95t change or yield to yours. Let\xc3\x95s hurry\xc3\x95, \rand he roused guards, who came up to take their place:\rleaving his post he walked by Nisus\xc3\x95s side to seek the prince.\r\rBKIX:224-313 NISUS AND EURYALUS: ALETES CONSENTS\r\rEvery other creature, throughout the land, was easing\rits cares with sleep, its heart forgetful of toil:\rthe Trojans\xc3\x95 chief captains, the pick of their manhood,\rwere holding council on the most serious affairs of state,\rwhat to do, and who should go now as messenger to Aeneas.\rThey stood, between the camp and the plain, leaning \ron their long spears, holding their shields. Nisus and Euryalus, \rtogether, begged eagerly to be admitted at once:\rthe matter being important, and worth the delay. Iulus was first\rto welcome the impatient pair, and ordered Nisus to speak. \rSo the son of Hyrtacus said: \xc3\x94Followers of Aeneas, listen\rwith fair minds, and don\xc3\x95t judge my words by our years.\rThe Rutulians are quiet, drowned in sleep and wine.\rWe ourselves have seen a place for a sortie: it opens \rin a fork of the road by the nearest gate to the sea.\rThere\xc3\x95s a gap between the fires, and black smoke rises\rto the stars. If you allow us to seize the chance,\ryou\xc3\x95ll soon see us back again burdened with spoils\rafter carrying out vast slaughter. The road will not \rdeceive us as we seek Aeneas and Pallanteum\xc3\x95s walls. \rIn our frequent hunting through the secret valleys\rwe\xc3\x95ve seen the outskirts of the city, and know the whole river.\xc3\x95\rTo this Aletes, heavy with years and wise in mind, replied:\r\xc3\x94Gods of our fathers, under whose power Troy lies,\ryou do not intend to obliterate the Trojan race as yet\rsince you bring us such courage in our young men and such \rfirm hearts.\xc3\x95 So saying, he took them both by the shoulder\rand hand while tears flooded his cheeks and lips.\r\xc3\x94What possible prize could I consider worthy\rto be granted you men for such a glorious action?\rThe gods and tradition will give you the first \rand most beautiful one: then good Aeneas,  and Ascanius,\rwho\xc3\x95s untouched by the years and never unmindful \rof such service, will immediately award the rest.\xc3\x95\rAscanius interrupted: \xc3\x94Rather I entreat you both, Nisus,\rsince my well-being depends on my father\xc3\x95s return, \rby the great gods of our house, by the Lar of Assaracus, \rand by grey-haired Vesta\xc3\x95s innermost shrine, I lay \rall my fortune and my promise in your lap, call my father back,\rgive me a sight of him: there\xc3\x95s no sorrow if he\xc3\x95s restored.\rI\xc3\x95ll give you a pair of wine-cups, all of silver, with figures\rin relief, that my father captured when Arisba was taken,\rand twin tripods, two large talents of gold, \rand an antique bowl Sidonian Dido gave me.\rIf we truly manage to capture Italy, and take the sceptre,\rand assign the spoils by lot, you have seen the horse \rgolden Turnus rode, and the armour he wore, I\xc3\x95ll separate\rfrom this moment, from the lots, that same horse, the shield, \rand the crimson plumes as your reward, Nisus.\rMoreover my father will give you twelve women \rof choicest person, and male captives all with their own armour,\rand, beyond that, whatever land King Latinus owns himself.\rBut now I truly welcome you wholly to my heart, Euryalus,\ra boy to be revered, whose age I come closer to in time,\rand embrace you as a friend for every occasion.\rI\xc3\x95ll never seek glory in my campaigns without you:\rwhether I enjoy peace or war, you\xc3\x95ll have my firmest trust\rin word and action.\xc3\x95 Euryalus spoke like this in reply:\r\xc3\x94No day will ever find me separated from such\rbold action: inasmuch as fortune proves kind \rand not cruel. But I ask one gift above all from you:\rI have a mother, of Priam\xc3\x95s ancient race, unhappy woman,\rwhom neither the land of Troy, nor King Acestes\xc3\x95s city\rcould keep from accompanying me. I leave her now,\rignorant of whatever risk to me there might be,\rand of my farewell, since ( this night and your \rright hand bear witness) I could not bear \ra mother\xc3\x95s tears. But I beg you, comfort \rher helplessness and aid her loss. Let me carry \rthis hope I place in you with me, I will meet all dangers \rmore boldly.\xc3\x95 Their spirits affected, the Trojans\rshed tears, noble Iulus above all, and this image \rof filial love touched his heart. Then he said:\r\xc3\x94Be sure I\xc3\x95ll do everything worthy of your great venture.\rShe\xc3\x95ll be as my mother to me, only lacking her name Creusa:\rno small gratitude\xc3\x95s due to her for bearing such a son.\rWhatever the outcome of your action, I swear by this life,\rby which my father used once to swear: what I promised \rto you when you return, your campaign successful,\rthat same will accrue to your mother and your house.\xc3\x95 \rSo he spoke, in tears: and at the same time stripped the gilded\rsword from his shoulder, that Lycaon of Cnossos had made \rwith marvellous art, and equipped for use with an ivory sheath.\rMnestheus gave Nisus a pelt, taken from a shaggy lion,\rloyal Aletes exchanged helmets. They armed, and left \rimmediately: and the whole band of leaders, young and old,\rescorted them to the gate as they went, with prayers. \rAnd noble Iulus too, with mature mind and duties \rbeyond his years, gave them many commissions \rto carry to his father: but the winds were to scatter \rthem all, and blow them vainly to the clouds.\r\rBKIX:314-366 NISUS AND EURYALUS: THE RAID\r\rLeaving, they crossed the ditches, seeking the enemy camp\rin the shadow of night, destined yet to first bring many deaths.\rThey saw bodies in drunken sleep, stretched here and there \ron the grass, chariots tilted upwards on the shore, men, among\rwheels and harness, and weapons and wine-cups lying about. \rNisus, Hyrtacus\xc3\x95s son, spoke first, saying: \r\xc3\x94Euryalus, now the occasion truly calls for a daring \rright hand. This is our road. You must see that no arm\xc3\x95s\rraised against us at our back, and keep watch carefully:\rI\xc3\x95ll deal destruction here, and cut you a wide path.\xc3\x95\rSo he spoke, and checked his speech, and at once \rdrove his sword at proud Rhamnes, who chanced to be\rbreathing deeply in sleep, piled with thick coverlets,\rHe was King Turnus\xc3\x95s best-beloved augur, and a king \rhimself, but he could not avert destruction with augury.\rNisus killed three of his servants nearby, lying careless\ramong their weapons, and Remus\xc3\x95s armour bearer, and his charioteer, \rfound at the horses\xc3\x95 feet: he severed lolling necks with his sword. \rThen he struck off the head of their lord himself, and left \rthe trunk spurting blood, the ground and the bed drenched \rwith dark warm blood. And Lamyrus too, and Lamum,\rand young Serranus, noted for his beauty, who had sported \rmuch that night, and lay there limbs drowned by much wine \xc3\x90\rhappy if he\xc3\x95d carried on his game all night till dawn:\rSo a starving lion churning through a full sheepfold, (driven \rby its raging hunger) gnaws and tears at the feeble flock \rmute with fear, and roars from its bloodstained mouth.\rNor was Euryalus\xc3\x95s slaughter any less: he too raged, ablaze,\rand among the nameless crowd he attacked Fadus,\rand Herbesus, and Abaris, while they were unconscious:\rand Rhoetus, but Rhoetus was awake and saw it all,\rbut crouched in fear behind a huge wine-bowl. As he rose, \rin close encounter, Euryalus plunged his whole blade\rinto Rhoetus\xc3\x95s chest, and withdrew it red with death. Rhoetus\rchoked out his life in dark blood, and, dying, brought up wine\rmixed with gore: the other pressed on fervently and stealthily.\rNow he approached Messapus\xc3\x95s followers: there he saw\rthe outermost fires flickering, and the horses, duly tethered,\rcropping the grass: Nisus (seeing him carried away \rby slaughter and love of the sword\xc3\x95s power) said briefly:\r\xc3\x94Let\xc3\x95s go, since unhelpful dawn is near. Enough: vengeance \rhas been satisfied: a path has been made through the enemy.\xc3\x95\rThey left behind many of the men\xc3\x95s weapons \rfashioned from solid silver, and wine-bowls and splendid hangings.\rEuryalus snatched Rhamnes\xc3\x95s trappings, and gold-studded\rsword-belt, gifts that wealthy Caedicus had once sent to Remulus\rof Tibur, expressing friendship in absence: he when dying \rgave them to his grandson as his own, and after his death in turn\rthe Rutulians captured them during the war in battle: now\rEuryalus fitted them over his brave shoulders, though in vain. \rThen he put on Messapus\xc3\x95s excellent helmet with its handsome \rplumes. The left the camp and headed for safety.\r\rBKIX:367-459 THE DEATH OF EURYALUS AND NISUS\r\rMeanwhile riders arrived, sent out from the Latin city,\rwhile the rest of the army waited in readiness, \ron the plain, bringing a reply for King Turnus:\rthree hundred, carrying shields, led by Volcens.\rThey were already near the camp, and below the walls,\rwhen they saw the two men turning down a path on the left:\rhis helmet, gleaming in the shadow of night, betrayed\rthe unthinking Euryalus, and reflected back the rays.\rIt was not seen in vain. Volcens shouted from his column:\r\xc3\x94You men, halt, what\xc3\x95s the reason for your journey? Who are you,\r you\xc3\x95re armed? Where are you off to?\xc3\x95 They offered no response,\rbut hastened their flight to the woods, trusting to the dark.\rThe riders closed off the known junctions, on every side,\rand surrounded each exit route with guards.\rThe forest spread out widely, thick with brambles \rand holm-oaks, the dense thorns filling it on every side:\rthere the path glinted through the secret glades.\rEuryalus was hampered by shadowy branches, and the weight\rof his plunder, and his fear confused the path\xc3\x95s direction.\rNisus was clear: and already unaware had escaped the enemy,\rand was at the place later called Alba from Alba Longa\r(at that time King Latinus had his noble stalls there)\rwhen he stopped, and looked back vainly for his missing friend.\r\xc3\x94Euryalus, unhappy boy, where did I separate from you? \rWhich way shall I go?\xc3\x95 he said, considering all the tangled tracks\rof the deceptive wood, and at the same time scanning \rthe backward traces he could see, criss-crossing the silent thickets.\rHe heard horses, heard the cries and signals of pursuit:\rand it was no great time before a shout reached his ears\rand he saw Euryalus, betrayed by the ground and the night,\rconfused by the sudden tumult, whom the whole troop\rwere dragging away, overpowered, struggling violently in vain.\rWhat can he do? With what force, or weapons, can he dare \rto rescue the youth? Should he hurl himself to his death among\rthe swords, and by his wounds hasten to a glorious end?\rHe swiftly drew back his spear arm and gazing upwards\rat the moon above, prayed, with these words:\r\xc3\x94O you, goddess, O you, Latona\xc3\x95s daughter, glory of the stars,\rand keeper of the woods, be here and help us in our trouble.\rIf ever my father, Hyrtacus, brought offerings on my behalf\rto your altars, if ever I added to them from my own hunting, \rhung them beneath your dome, or fixed them to the sacred eaves,\rlet me throw their troop into confusion, guide my spear through the air.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke and flung the steel, straining with his whole body.\rThe flying javelin divided the shadows, struck Sulmo\xc3\x95s back,\ras he turned, and snapped, the broken shaft piercing the heart.\rHe rolled over, a hot stream pouring from his chest,\rand deep gasps shook his sides, as he grew cold. \rThey gazed round them, in every direction. See, Nisus, \rall the more eager, levelled another spear against his ear.\rWhile they hesitated, the javelin hissed through both\rof Tagus\xc3\x95s temples, and fixed itself still warm in the pierced\rbrain. Fierce Volcens raged, but could not spy out the author \rof the act, nor any place that he could vent his fire.\rHe rushed at Euryalus with his naked sword, as he\rcried out: \xc3\x94In the mean time you\xc3\x95ll pay in hot blood \rand give me revenge for both your crimes.\xc3\x95\rThen, truly maddened with fear, Nisus shouted aloud, unable\rto hide himself in the dark any longer, or endure such agony:\rOn me, Rutulians, turn your steel on me, me who did the deed!\rThe guilt is all mine, he neither dared nor had the power:\rthe sky and the all-knowing stars be witnesses:\rhe only loved his unfortunate friend too much.\xc3\x95\rHe was still speaking, but the sword, powerfully driven,\rpassed through the ribs and tore the white breast.\rEuryalus rolled over in death, and the blood flowed \rdown his lovely limbs, and his neck, drooping, \rsank on his shoulder, like a bright flower scythed\rby the plough, bowing as it dies, or a poppy weighed \rdown by a chance shower, bending its weary head.\rBut Nisus rushed at them, seeking Volcens \rabove all, intent on Volcens alone.\rThe enemy gathered round him, to drive him off,\rin hand to hand conflict. He attacked none the less, whirling \rhis sword like lightning, until he buried it full in the face\rof the shrieking Rutulian, and, dying, robbed his enemy of life. \rThen, pierced through, he threw himself on the lifeless body\rof his friend, and found peace at last in the calm of death.\rHappy pair! If my poetry has the power, \rwhile the House of Aeneas lives beside the Capitol\xc3\x95s \rimmobile stone, and a Roman leader rules the Empire,\rno day will raze you from time\xc3\x95s memory.\rThe victorious Rutulians, gaining new plunder, and the spoils,\rweeping carried the lifeless Volcens to the camp.\rNor was there less grief in that camp when Rhamnes\rwas discovered, drained of blood, and so many other leaders,\rkilled in a single slaughter, with Serranus and Numa. A huge \rcrowd rushed towards the corpses and the dying, and the place\rfresh with hot killing, and foaming streams full of blood. \rBetween them they identified the spoils, Messapus\xc3\x95s \rgleaming helmet, and his trappings re-won with such sweat.\r\rBKIX:460-524 EURYALUS\xc3\x95S MOTHER LAMENTS\r \rAnd now Aurora, early, leaving Tithonus\xc3\x95s saffron bed, \rsprinkled her fresh rays onto the earth. And now\ras the sun streamed down, now as day revealed all things,\rTurnus armed himself, and roused his heroes to arms:\rthey gathered their bronze-clad troops for the battle,\reach his own, and whetted their anger with various tales.\rThey even fixed the heads of Euryalus and Nisus \ron raised spears (wretched sight), and followed\rbehind them, making a great clamour.\rThe tough sons of Aeneas had fixed their opposing lines\ron the left side of the ramparts (the right bordered on the river)\rand they held the wide ditches and stood grieving \ron the high turrets: moved as one, made wretched by seeing the heads \rof men they know only too well transfixed and streaming dark blood.\rMeanwhile winged Rumour, flying through the anxious town,\rsped the news, and stole to the ears of Euryalus\xc3\x95s mother.\rAnd suddenly all warmth left her helpless bones,\rthe shuttle was hurled from her hands, the thread unwound.\rThe wretched woman rushed out and sought the ramparts\rand the front line, shrieking madly, her hair dishevelled:\rshe ignored the soldiers, the danger, the weapons, \rthen she filled the heavens with her lament:\xc3\x95\r\xc3\x94Is it you I see, Euryalus? You who brought peace\rat last to my old age, how could you bring yourself\rto leave me alone, cruel child? Why did you not give \ryour poor mother the chance for a final goodbye \rwhen you were being sent into so much danger?\rAh, you lie here in a strange land, given as prey to the carrion \rbirds and dogs of Latium! I, your mother, did not escort you\rin funeral procession, or close your eyes, or bathe your wounds, \ror shroud you with the robes I laboured at night and day \rfor you, soothing the cares of old age at the loom.\rWhere shall I go? What earth now holds your body,\ryour torn limbs, your mangled corpse? My son, \ris this what you bring home to me? Is this why I followed you\rby land and sea? O Rutulians, if you have feelings, pierce me: \rhurl all your spears at me: destroy me above all with your steel:\ror you, great father of the gods, pity me, and with \ryour lightning bolt, hurl this hated being down to Tartarus,\rsince I can shatter this cruel life no other way.\xc3\x95\rThis wailing shook their hearts, and a groan of sorrow swept \rthem all: their strength for battle was numbed and weakened.\rShe was igniting grief and Idaeus and Actor, \rat Ilioneus\xc3\x95s order, with Iulus weeping bitterly, \rcaught her up, and carried her inside in their arms. \rBut the war-trumpet, with its bronze singing, rang out\rits terrible sound, a clamour followed, that the sky re-echoed.\rThe Volscians, raising their shields in line, ran forward,\rready to fill in the ditches, and tear down the ramparts:\rSome tried for an entrance, and to scale the wall with ladders,\rwhere the ranks were thin, and a less dense cordon of men\rallowed the light through. The Trojans accustomed to defending\rtheir walls by endless warfare, hurled missiles at them\rof every sort, and fended them off with sturdy poles.\rThey rolled down stones too, deadly weights, \rin the hope of breaking through the well-protected ranks,\rwhich under their solid shields, however, rejoiced\rin enduring every danger. But soon even they were inadequate\rsince the Trojans rolled a vast rock to where a large formation\rthreatened, and hurled it down, felling the Rutulians \rfar and wide, and breaking their armoured shell. \rThe brave Rutulians no longer cared to fight blindly, \rbut tried to clear the ramparts with missiles.\rElsewhere, Mezentius, deadly to behold, brandished\rTuscan pine, and hurled smoking firebrands:\rwhile Messapus, tamer of horses, scion of Neptune,\rtore at the rampart, and called for scaling ladders.\r\rBKIX:525-589 TURNUS IN BATTLE\r \rI pray to you, O Calliope, Muses, inspire my singing\rof the slaughter, the deaths Turnus dealt with his sword\rthat day, and who each warrior was, that he sent down to Orcus,\rand open the lips of mighty war with me,\rsince, goddesses, you remember, and have the power to tell:\rThere was a turret, tall to look at, with high access-ways,\rand a good position, that all the Italians tried with utmost power\rto storm, and to dislodge with the utmost power of their efforts:\rthe Trojans in turn defended themselves with stones\rand hurled showers of missiles through the open loopholes.\rTurnus was first to throw a blazing torch and root the flames\rin its flank, that, fanned by a strong wind, seized\rthe planking, and clung to the entrances they devoured.\rThe anxious men inside were afraid, and tried in vain\rto escape disaster. While they clung together and retreated\rto the side free from damage, the turret suddenly \rcollapsed, and the whole sky echoed to the crash.\rHalf-dead they fell to earth, the huge mass following,\rpierced by their own weapons, and their chests impaled \ron the harsh wood. Only Helenor and Lycus managed \rto escape: Helenor being in the prime of youth, one\rwhom a Licymnian slave had secretly borne to the Maeonian king,\rand sent to Troy, with weapons he\xc3\x95d been forbidden,\rlightly armed with naked blade, and anonymous white shield.\rWhen he found himself in the midst of Turnus\xc3\x95s thousands,\rLatin ranks standing to right and left of him,\ras a wild creature, hedged in by a close circle of hunters,\rrages against theirs weapons, and hurls itself, consciously, \rto death, and is carried by its leap on to the hunting spears,\rso the youth rushed to his death among the enemy,\rand headed for where the weapons appeared thickest.\rBut Lycus, quicker of foot, darting among the enemy\rand their arms reached the wall, and tried to grasp \rthe high parapet with his hands, to reach his comrades\xc3\x95 grasp.\rTurnus following him closely on foot, with his spear,\rtaunted in triumph: \xc3\x94Madman, did you hope to escape\rmy reach?\xc3\x95 He seized him, there and then, as he hung,\rand pulled him down, with a large piece of the wall,\rlike an eagle, carrier of Jove\xc3\x95s lightning bolt, soaring high,\rlifting a hare or the snow-white body of a swan in its talons,\ror a wolf, Mars\xc3\x95s creature, snatching a lamb from the fold,\rthat its mother searches for endlessly bleating. A shout rose\ron all sides: the Rutulians drove forwards, some filling\rthe ditches with mounds of earth, others throwing burning brands\ronto the roofs. Ilioneus felled Lucetius with a rock, a vast fragment\rof the hillside, as he neared the gate, carrying fire, Liger\rkilled Emathion, Asilas killed Corynaeus, the first skilled \rwith the javelin, the other with deceptive long-range arrows:\rCaenus felled Ortygius, Turnus victorious Caeneus, and Itys\rand Clonius, Dioxippus and Promolus, and Sagaris, and Idas\ras he stood on the highest tower, and Capys killed Privernus.\rThemillas had grazed him slightly first with his spear, foolishly\rhe threw his shield down, and placed his hand on the wound:\rso the arrow winged silently, fixed itself deep in his left side,\rand, burying itself within, tore the breathing passages \rwith a lethal wound. Arcens son stood there too in glorious\rarmour, his cloak embroidered with scenes, bright with Spanish blue,\ra youth of noble features, whom his father Arcens had sent,\rreared in Mars\xc3\x95s grove by Symaethus\xc3\x95s streams,\rwhere the rich and gracious altars of Palicus stand:\rMezentius, dropping his spears, whirled a whistling sling\ron its tight thong, three times round his head, and split \rhis adversary\xc3\x95s forehead open in the middle, with \rthe now-molten lead, stretching him full length in the deep sand.\rBKIX:590-637 ASCANIUS (IULUS) IN BATTLE\r\rThen they say Ascanius first aimed his swift arrows \rin war, used till now to terrify wild creatures in flight,\rand with his hand he felled brave Numanus,\rwho was surnamed Remulus, and had \rlately won Turnus\xc3\x95s sister as his wife.\rNumanus marched ahead of the front rank,\rshouting words that were fitting and unfitting \rto repeat, his heart swollen with new-won royalty\rand boasting loudly of his greatness:\r\xc3\x94Twice conquered Trojans aren\xc3\x95t you ashamed to be besieged\rand shut behind ramparts again, fending off death with walls?\rBehold, these are the men who\xc3\x95d demand our brides through war!\rWhat god, what madness has driven you to Italy?\rHere are no Atrides, no Ulysses, maker of fictions:\ra race from hardy stock, we first bring our newborn sons \rto the river, and toughen them with the water\xc3\x95s fierce chill:\ras children they keep watch in the chase, and weary the forest,\rtheir play is to wheel their horses and shoot arrows from the bow:\rbut patient at work, and used to little, our young men\rtame the earth with the hoe, or shake cities in battle.\rAll our life we\xc3\x95re abraded by iron: we goad our bullocks\xc3\x95\rflanks with a reversed spear, and slow age\rdoesn\xc3\x95t weaken our strength of spirit, or alter our vigour:\rwe set a helmet on our white hairs, and delight\rin collecting fresh spoils, and living on plunder.\rYou wear embroidered saffron and gleaming purple,\ridleness pleases you, you delight in the enjoyment of dance,\rand your tunics have sleeves, and your hats have ribbons.\rO truly you Phrygian women, as you\xc3\x95re not Phrygian men,\rrun over the heights of Dindymus, where a double-reed\rmakes music for accustomed ears. The timbrels call to you,\rand the Berecynthian boxwood flute of the Mother of Ida:\rleave weapons to men and abandon the sword.\rAscanius did not tolerate such boastful words and dire warnings,\rbut facing him, fitted an arrow to the horsehair string, and, \rstraining his arms apart, paused, and first prayed humbly to Jove\rmaking these vows: \xc3\x94All-powerful Jupiter, assent to my bold attempt.\rI myself will bring gifts each year to your temple,\rand I\xc3\x95ll place before your altar a snow-white bullock \rwith gilded forehead, carrying his head as high as his mother,\ralready butting with his horns, and scattering sand with his hooves.\xc3\x95\rThe Father heard, and thundered on the left \rfrom a clear sky, as one the fatal bow twanged.\rThe taut arrow sped onwards with a dreadful hiss,\rand passed through Remulus\xc3\x95s brow, and split the hollow\rtemples with its steel. \xc3\x94Go on, mock at virtue with proud words!\rThis is the reply the twice-conquered Phrygians send the Rutulians\xc3\x95:\rAscanius said nothing more. The Trojans followed this \rwith cheers, shouted for joy, and raised their spirits to the skies.\r\rBKIX:638-671 APOLLO SPEAKS TO IULUS\r\rNow, by chance, long-haired Apollo, seated in the cloudy\rskies, looked down on the Italian ranks and the town,\rand spoke to the victorious Iulus as follows:\r\xc3\x94Blessings on your fresh courage, boy, scion of gods\rand ancestor of gods yet to be, so it is man rises \rto the stars. All the wars that destiny might bring \rwill rightly cease under the rule of Assaracus\xc3\x95s house,\rTroy does not limit you.\xc3\x95 With this he launched himself\rfrom high heaven, parted the living air, and found \rAscanius: then changed the form of his features\rto old Butes. He was once armour-bearer to Trojan \rAnchises, and faithful guardian of the threshold:\rthen Ascanius\xc3\x95s father made him the boy\xc3\x95s companion.\rAs he walked Apollo was like the old man in every way,\rin voice and colouring, white hair, and clanging of harsh \rweapons, and he spoke these words to the ardent Iulus:\r\xc3\x94Enough, son of Aeneas, that Numanus has fallen to your bow\rand is un-avenged. Mighty Apollo grants you this first glory,\rand does not begrudge you your like weapons:\rbut avoid the rest of the battle, boy.\xc3\x95 So Apollo \rspoke and in mid-speech left mortal sight \rand vanished far from men\xc3\x95s eyes into clear air. \rThe Trojan princes recognised the god and his celestial \rweapons, and heard his quiver rattling as he flew.\rSo, given the god\xc3\x95s words and his divine will, they stopped\rAscanius, eager for the fight, while themselves returning \rto the battle, and openly putting their lives at risk.\rThe clamour rang through the towers along the whole wall,\rthey bent their bows quickly and whirled their slings.\rThe whole earth was strewn with spears: shields and hollow\rhelmets clanged as they clashed together, the battle grew fierce: \rvast as a rainstorm from the west, lashing the ground \rbeneath watery Auriga, and dense as the hail the clouds hurl\rinto the waves, when Jupiter, bristling with southerlies,\rtwirls the watery tempest, and bursts the sky\xc3\x95s cavernous vapours. \r\rBKIX:672-716 TURNUS AT THE TROJAN GATES\r\rPandarus and Bitias, sons of Alcanor from Ida, whom Iaera \rthe wood-nymph bore in Jupiter\xc3\x95s grove, youths tall \ras the pine-trees on their native hills, threw open the gate\rentrusted to them by their leader\xc3\x95s command, and, relying on\rtheir weapons, drew the Rutulian enemy within the walls.\rThey themselves stood in the gate, in front of the towers to right\rand left, steel armoured, with plumes waving on their noble heads:\rjust as twin oaks rise up into the air, by flowing rivers,\ron the banks of the Po, or by delightful Athesis, lifting\rtheir shaggy heads to the sky, and nodding their tall crowns.\rWhen they saw the entrance clear the Rutulians rushed through.\rAt once Quercens and Aquicolus, handsome in his armour,\rTmarus, impulsive at heart, and Haemon, a son of Mars,\rwere routed with all their Rutulian ranks, and took to their heels,\ror laid down their lives on the very threshold of the gate.\rThen the anger grew fiercer in their fighting spirits,\rand soon the Trojans gathering massed in the same place,\rand dared to fight hand to hand, and advance further outside. \rThe news reached Turnus, the Rutulian leader, as he raged\rand troubled the lines in a distant part of the field, that the enemy,\rhot with fresh slaughter, were laying their doors wide open.\rHe left what he had begun, and, roused to savage fury,\rhe ran towards the Trojan gate, and the proud brothers.\rAnd first he brought Antiphates down with a spear throw,\r(since he was first to advance), bastard son of noble Sarpedon\rby a Theban mother: the Italian cornel-wood shaft flew through\rthe clear air and, fixing in his belly, ran deep up into his chest:\rthe hollow of the dark wound released a foaming flow,\rand the metal became warm in the pierced lung.\rThen he overthrew Meropes and Erymas with his hand,\rand then Aphidnus, then Bitias, fire in his eyes, clamour\rin his heart, not to a spear (he would never have lost his life\rto a spear) but a javelin arrived with a great hiss, hurled\rand driven like a thunderbolt, that neither two bulls\xc3\x95 hides \rnor the faithful breastplate with double scales of gold\rcould resist: the mighty limbs collapsed and fell,\rearth groaned and the huge shield clanged above him.\rSo a rock pile sometimes falls on Baiae\xc3\x95s Euboic shore,\rfirst constructed of huge blocks, then toppled into the sea:\ras it falls it trails havoc behind, tumbles into the shallows\rand settles in the depths: the sea swirls in confusion, \rand the dark sand rises upwards, then Procida\xc3\x95s \rlofty island trembles at the sound and Ischia\xc3\x95s isle\xc3\x95s\rharsh floor, laid down over Typhoeus, at Jove\xc3\x95s command. \r\rBKIX:717-755 THE DEATH OF PANDARUS\r\rAt this Mars, powerful in war, gave the Latins strength\rand courage, and twisted his sharp goad in their hearts,\rand sent Rout and dark Fear against the Trojans. \rGiven the chance for action, the Latins came together\rfrom every side, and the god of battle possessed their souls.\rPandarus, seeing his brother\xc3\x95s fallen corpse, and which side\rfortune was on, and what fate was driving events,\rpushed with a mighty heave of his broad shoulders\rand swung the gate on its hinges, leaving many a comrade\rlocked outside the wall in the cruel conflict: but the rest\rhe greeted as they rushed in and shut in there, with himself,\rfoolishly, not seeing the Rutulian king bursting through\ramong the mass, freely closing him inside the town,\rlike a huge tiger among a helpless herd.\rAt once fresh fire flashed from Turnus\xc3\x95s eyes\rhis weapons clashed fearfully, the blood-red plumes\ron his helmet quivered, and lightning glittered from his shield.\rIn sudden turmoil the sons of Aeneas recognised that hated form\rand those huge limbs. Then great Pandarus sprang forward,\rblazing with anger at his brother\xc3\x95s death, shouting:\rThis is not Queen Amata\xc3\x95s palace, given in dowry, or the heart \rof Ardea, surrounding Turnus with his native walls.\rYou see an enemy camp: you can\xc3\x95t escape from here.\xc3\x95\rTurnus, smiling, his thoughts calm, replied to him:\r\xc3\x94Come then, if there\xc3\x95s courage in your heart, close with me:\r you can go tell Priam that, here too, you found an Achilles.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke. Pandarus, straining with all his force, hurled \rhis spear rough with knots and un-stripped bark:\rthe wind took it, Saturnian Juno deflected \rthe imminent blow, and the spear stuck fast in the gate.\rTurnus cried: \xc3\x94But you\xc3\x95ll not escape this weapon\rmy right arm wields with power, the source of this weapon \rand wound is not such as you.\xc3\x95: and he towered up, his sword\rlifted, and, with the blade, cleft the forehead in two between \rthe temples, down to the beardless jaw, in an evil wound.\rThere was a crash: the ground shook under the vast weight.\rPandarus, dying, lowered his failing limbs and brain-spattered\rweapons to the ground, and his skull split in half \rhung down on either side over both his shoulders. \r\rBKIX:756-787 TURNUS SLAUGHTERS THE TROJANS\r\rThe Trojans turned and fled in sudden terror,\rand if Turnus had thought at once to burst the bolts\rby force, and let in his comrades through the gates,\rthat would have been the end of the war and the nation.\rBut rage and insane desire for slaughter drove him,\rpassionate, against the enemy. First he caught Phaleris\rand Gyges whom he hamstrung, then flung their spears,\rwhich he seized, at the backs of the fleeing crowd.\rJuno aided him in strength and spirit. He sent\rHalys and Phegeus, his shield pierced, to join them, \rthen Alcander and Halius, Noemon and Prytanis\runawares, as they roused those on the walls to battle.\rAs Lynceus calling to his comrades moved towards him,\rhe anticipated him with a stroke of his glittering sword\rfrom the right-hand rampart, Lynceus\xc3\x95s head, severed\rby the single blow at close quarters, fell to the ground\rwith the helmet some distance away. Then Amycus,\rthat threat to wild creatures, than whom none was better\rat coating spears and arming steel with poison,\rand Clytius, son of Aeolus, and Cretheus, friend to the Muses,\rCretheus the Muses\xc3\x95 follower, to whom song and lyre\rand striking measures on the strings were always a delight,\ralways he sang of horses, of soldiers\xc3\x95 weapons and battles.\rAt last the Trojan leaders, Mnestheus and brave Serestus,\rhearing of this slaughter of their men, arrived to see \rtheir troops scattered and the enemy within. \rMnestheus shouted: \xc3\x94Where are you running to, off where?\rWhat other walls or battlements do you have, but these? \rO citizens, shall one man, hemmed in on all sides by ramparts,\rcause such carnage through this our city, and go unpunished? \rShall he send so many of our noblest youths to Orcus?\rCowards, have you no pity, no shame, for your wretched \rcountry, for your ancient gods, for great Aeneas?\xc3\x95 \r\rBKIX:788-818 TURNUS IS DRIVEN OFF\r\rInflamed by such words they were strengthened, and they halted,\rdensely packed. Turnus little by little retreated from the fight,\rheading for the river, and a place embraced by the waves.\rThe Trojans pressed towards him more fiercely, with a great clamour,\rand massed together, as a crowd of hunters with levelled spears\rclose in on a savage lion: that, fearful but fierce, glaring in anger,\rgives ground, though fury and courage won\xc3\x95t let it turn its back,\rnor will men and spears allow it to attack, despite its wish. \rSo Turnus wavering retraced his steps \rcautiously, his mind seething with rage.\rEven then he charged amongst the enemy twice,\rand twice sent them flying a confused rabble along the walls:\rbut the whole army quickly gathered en masse from the camp,\rand Saturnian Juno didn\xc3\x95t dare empower him against them,\rsince Jupiter sent Iris down through the air from heaven,\rcarrying no gentle commands for his sister, if Turnus did not leave\rthe high Trojan ramparts. Therefore the warrior, overwhelmed \rby so many missiles hurled from every side, couldn\xc3\x95t so much as \rhold his own with shield and sword-arm. The helmet protecting\rhis hollow temples rang with endless noise, the solid bronze gaped\rfrom the hail of stones, his crest was torn off, and his shield-boss\rcouldn\xc3\x95t withstand the blows: the Trojans, with deadly Mnestheus \rhimself, redoubled their rain of javelins. Then the sweat ran all over\rTurnus\xc3\x95s body, and flowed in a dark stream (he\xc3\x95d no time to breathe)\rand an agonised panting shook his exhausted body.\rThen, finally, leaping headlong, he plunged down into the river\rin full armour. The Tiber welcomed him to its yellow flood \ras he fell, lifted him on its gentle waves, and, washing away\rthe blood, returned him, overjoyed, to his friends.\r\r\r\n\r\rBOOK X\r\r\rBKX:1-95 THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS\r\rMeanwhile the palace of all-powerful Olympus\rwas opened wide, and the father of the gods, and king of men,\rcalled a council in his starry house, from whose heights\rhe gazed at every land, at Trojan camp, and Latin people.\rThey took their seats in the hall with doors at east and west,\rand he began: \xc3\x94Great sky-dwellers, why have you changed\ryour decision, competing now, with such opposing wills? \rI commanded Italy not to make war on the Trojans.\rWhy this conflict, against my orders? What fear\rhas driven them both to take up arms and incite violence?\rThe right time for fighting will arrive (don\xc3\x95t bring it on)\rwhen fierce Carthage, piercing the Alps, will launch \rgreat destruction on the Roman strongholds:\rthen it will be fine to compete in hatred, and ravage things.\rNow let it alone, and construct a treaty, gladly, as agreed.\xc3\x95\rJupiter\xc3\x95s speech was brief as this: but golden Venus\xc3\x95s reply was not:\r\xc3\x94O father, eternal judge of men and things\r(for who else is there I can make my appeal to now?)\ryou see how the Rutulians exult, how Turnus is drawn\rby noble horses through the crowd, and, fortunate in war,\rrushes on proudly. Barred defences no longer protect the Trojans:\rrather they join battle within the gates, and on the rampart \rwalls themselves, and the ditches are filled with blood.\rAeneas is absent, unaware of this. Will you never let the siege\rbe raised? A second enemy once again menaces and harasses \rnew-born Troy, and again, from Aetolian Arpi, a Diomede rises.\rI almost think the wound I had from him still awaits me:\ryour child merely delays the thrust of that mortal\xc3\x95s weapon.\rIf the Trojans sought Italy without your consent, and despite\ryour divine will, let them expiate the sin: don\xc3\x95t grant them help.\rBut if they\xc3\x95ve followed the oracles of powers above and below,\rwhy should anyone change your orders now, and forge new destinies?\rShall I remind you of their fleet, burned on the shores of Eryx?\rOr the king of the storms and his furious winds roused \rfrom Aeolia, or Iris sent down from the clouds?\rNow Juno even stirs the dead (the only lot still left to use)\rand Allecto too, suddenly loosed on the upper world,\rruns wild through all the Italian cities.\rI no longer care about Empire. Though that was my hope\rwhile fortune was kind. Let those you wish to win prevail.\rFather, if there\xc3\x95s no land your relentless queen will grant the Trojans,\rI beg, by the smoking ruins of shattered Troy, let me bring\rAscanius, untouched, from among the weapons: let my grandson live.\rAeneas, yes, may be tossed on unknown seas, and go\rwherever Fortune grants a road: but let me have the power\rto protect the child and remove him from the fatal battle.\rAmathus is mine, high Paphos and Cythera are mine,\rand Idalia\xc3\x95s temple: let him ground his weapons there,\rand live out inglorious years. Command that Carthage,\rwith her great power, crush Italy: then there\xc3\x95ll be \rno obstacle to the Tyrian cities. What was the use in their escaping\rthe plague of war, fleeing through the heart of Argive flames,\renduring the dangers at sea, and in desolate lands,\ras long as the Trojans seek Latium and Troy re-born?\rWouldn\xc3\x95t it have been better to build on those last embers\rof their country, on the soil where Troy once stood?\rGive Xanthus and Simois back to these unfortunates, \rfather, I beg you, and let the Trojans re-live the course of Ilium.\xc3\x95\rThen royal Juno goaded to savage frenzy, cried out:\r\xc3\x94Why do you make me shatter my profound silence,\rand utter words of suffering to the world?\rDid any god or man force Aeneas to make war\rand attack King Latinus as an enemy?\rHe sought Italy prompted by the Fates (so be it)\rimpelled by Cassandra\xc3\x95s ravings: was he urged by me\rto leave the camp, and trust his life to the winds?\rTo leave the outcome of war, and their defences to a child:\rto disturb Tuscan good faith, and peaceful tribes?\rWhat goddess, what harsh powers of mine drove him\rto harm? Where is Juno in this, or Iris sent from the clouds?\rIf it\xc3\x95s shameful that the Italians surround new-born Troy\rwith flames, and Turnus make a stand on his native soil,\rhe whose ancestor is Pilumnus, divine Venilia his mother:\rwhat of the Trojans with smoking brands using force against the Latins,\rplanting their yoke on others\xc3\x95 fields and driving off their plunder?\rDeciding whose daughters to marry, and dragging betrothed girls\rfrom their lover\xc3\x95s arms, offering peace with one hand, \rbut decking their ships with weapons? You can steal\rAeneas away from Greek hands and grant them fog and empty air\rinstead of a man, and turn their fleet of ships into as many nymphs:\ris it wrong then for me to have given some help to the Rutulians?\r\xc3\x92Aeneas is absent, unaware of this.\xc3\x93 Let him be absent and unaware.\rPaphos, Idalium, and high Cythera are yours? Why meddle then\rwith a city pregnant with wars and fierce hearts?\rIs it I who try to uproot Troy\xc3\x95s fragile state from its base?  \rIs it I? Or he who exposed the wretched Trojans to the Greeks?\rWhat reason was there for Europe and Asia to rise up\rin arms, and dissolve their alliance, through treachery?\rDid I lead the Trojan adulterer to conquer Sparta?\rDid I give him weapons, or foment a war because of his lust?\rThen, you should have feared for your own: now, too late,\ryou raise complaints without justice, and provoke useless quarrels.\xc3\x95\r\rBKX:96-117 JUPITER LEAVES THE OUTCOME TO FATE\r\rSo Juno argued, and all the divinities of heaven murmured\rtheir diverse opinions, as when rising gales murmur in the woods\rand roll out their secret humming, warning sailors of coming storms. \rThen the all-powerful father, who has prime authority over things,\rbegan (the noble hall of the gods fell silent as he spoke,\rearth trembled underground, high heaven fell silent,\rthe Zephyrs too were stilled, the sea calmed its placid waters).\r\xc3\x94Take my words to heart and fix them there. \rSince Italians and Trojans are not allowed to join \rin alliance, and your disagreement has no end,\rI will draw no distinction between them, Trojan or Rutulian,\rwhatever luck each has today, whatever hopes they pursue,\rwhether the camp\xc3\x95s under siege, because of Italy\xc3\x95s fortunes,\ror Troy\xc3\x95s evil wanderings and unhappy prophecies.\rNor will I absolve the Rutulians. What each has instigated\rshall bring its own suffering and success. Jupiter is king of all, \requally: the fates will determine the way.\xc3\x95 He nodded, \rswearing it by the waters of his Stygian brother, \rby the banks that seethe with pitch, and the black chasm\rand made all Olympus tremble at his nod.\rSo the speaking ended. Jupiter rose from his golden throne,\rand the divinities led him to the threshold, among them.\r\rBKX:118-162 AENEAS RETURNS FROM PALLANTIUM\r\rMeanwhile the Rutulians gathered round every gate,\rto slaughter the men, and circle the walls with flames,\rwhile Aeneas\xc3\x95s army was held inside their stockade,\rimprisoned, with no hope of escape. Wretchedly they stood\rthere on the high turrets, and circling the walls, a sparse ring.\rAsius, son of Imbrasus, Thymoetes, son of Hicetaon,\rthe two Assaraci, and Castor with old Thymbris were the front rank:\rSarpedon\xc3\x95s two brothers, Clarus and Thaemon, from noble Lycia, \rwere at their side. Acmon of Lyrnesus, no less huge than his father \rClytius, or his brother Mnestheus, lifted a giant rock, \rno small fragment of a hillside, straining his whole body.\rSome tried to defend with javelins, some with stones,\rhurling fire and fitting arrows to the bow.\rSee, the Trojan boy, himself, in their midst, \rVenus\xc3\x95s special care, his handsome head uncovered,\rsparkling like a jewel set in yellow gold \radorning neck or forehead, gleaming like ivory, \rinlaid skilfully in boxwood or Orician terebinth: \rhis milk-white neck, and the circle of soft gold\rclasping it, received his flowing hair.  \rYour great-hearted people saw you too Ismarus,\rdipping reed-shafts in venom, and aiming them \rto wound, from a noble Lydian house, there where men\rtill rich fields, that the Pactolus waters with gold. There was \rMnestheus as well, whom yesterday\xc3\x95s glory, of beating \rTurnus back from the wall\xc3\x95s embankment, exalted highly, \rand Capys: from him the name of the Campanian city comes.\rMen were fighting each other in the conflict of bitter war:\rwhile Aeneas, by night, was cutting through the waves.\rWhen, on leaving Evander and entering the Tuscan camp,\rhe had met the king, announced his name and race,\rthe help he sought, and that he himself offered, \rwhat forces Mezentius was gathering to him, \rand the violence in Turnus\xc3\x95s heart, and then had warned\rhow little faith can be placed in human powers,\rand had added his entreaties, Tarchon, joined forces with him\rwithout delay, and agreed a treaty: then fulfilling their fate\rthe Lydian people took to their ships by divine command,\rtrusting to a \xc3\x94foreign\xc3\x95 leader. Aeneas\xc3\x95s vessel took the van,\radorned with Phrygian lions below her beak, Mount Ida \rtowering above them, a delight to the exiled Trojans.\rThere great Aeneas sat and pondered the varying issues\rof the war, and Pallas sticking close to his left side, asked him\rnow about the stars, their path through the dark night,\rand now about his adventures on land and sea.\r\rBKX:163-214 THE LEADERS OF THE TUSCAN FLEET\r\rNow, goddesses, throw Helicon wide open: begin your song\rof the company that followed Aeneas from Tuscan shores,\rarming the ships and riding over the seas.\rMassicus cut the waters at their head, in the bronze-armoured Tiger,\ra band of a thousand warriors under him, leaving the walls\rof Clusium, and the city of Cosae, whose weapons are arrows,\rheld in light quivers over their shoulders, and deadly bows.\rGrim Abas was with him: whose ranks were all splendidly \rarmoured, his ship aglow with a gilded figure of Apollo.\rPopulonia, the mother-city, had given him six hundred\rof her offspring, all expert in war, and the island of Ilva, rich \rwith the Chalybes\xc3\x95 inexhaustible mines, three hundred.\rAsilas was third, that interpreter of gods and men,\rto whom the entrails of beasts were an open book, the stars\rin the sky, the tongues of birds, the prophetic bolts of lightning.\rHe hurried his thousand men to war, dense ranks bristling with spears.\rPisa ordered them to obey, city of Alphean foundation,\rset on Etruscan soil. Then the most handsome Astur\rfollowed, Astur relying on horse and iridescent armour.\rThree hundred more (minded to follow as one) were added \rby those with their home in Caere, the fields \rby the Minio, ancient Pyrgi, unhealthy Graviscae. \rI would not forget you, Cunerus, in war the bravest \rLigurian leader, or you with your small company, Cupavo, \ron whose crest the swan plumes rose, a sign of your father\xc3\x95s \rtransformation (Cupid, your and your mother\xc3\x95s crime).\rFor they say that Cycnus wept for his beloved Phaethon,\rsinging amongst the poplar leaves, those shades of Phaethon\xc3\x95s\rsisters, consoling his sorrowful passion with the Muse,\rand drew white age over himself, in soft plumage,\rrelinquishing earth, and seeking the stars with song.\rHis son, Cupavo, drove on the mighty Centaur, following \rthe fleet, with troops of his own age: the figurehead towered \rover the water, threatening from above to hurl a huge rock \rinto the waves, the long keel ploughing through the deep ocean.\rOcnus, also, called up troops from his native shores,\rhe, the son of Manto the prophetess and the Tuscan river,\rwho gave you your walls, Mantua, and his mother\xc3\x95s name,\rMantua rich in ancestors, but not all of one race:\rthere were three races there, under each race four tribes,\rherself the head of the tribes, her strength from Tuscan blood.\rFrom there too Mezentius drove five hundred to arm against him,\rlead in pine warships through the sea by a figure, the River Mincius, \rthe child of Lake Benacus, crowned with grey-green reeds.\rAulestes ploughed on weightily, lashing the waves as he surged\rto the stroke of a hundred oars: the waters foamed as the surface churned.\rHe sailed the huge Triton, whose conch shell alarmed the blue waves,\rit\xc3\x95s carved prow displayed a man\xc3\x95s form down to the waist, \ras it sailed on, its belly ending in a sea-creature\xc3\x95s, while \runder the half-man\xc3\x95s chest the waves murmured with foam.\rSuch was the count of princes chosen to sail in the thirty ships\rto the aid of Troy, and plough the salt plains with their bronze rams.\r\rBKX:215-259 THE NYMPHS OF CYBELE\r\rNow daylight had vanished from the sky and kindly Phoebe\rwas treading mid-heaven with her nocturnal team:\rAeneas (since care allowed his limbs no rest) sat there\rcontrolling the helm himself, and tending the sails.\rAnd see, in mid-course, a troop of his own friends\rappeared: the nymphs, whom gracious Cybele\rhad commanded to be goddesses of the sea,\rto be nymphs not ships, swam beside him and cut the flood,\ras many as the bronze prows that once lay by the shore.\rThey knew the king from far off, and circled him dancing:\rand Cymodocea, following, most skilful of them in speech, \rcaught at the stern with her right hand, lifted her length herself, \rand paddled along with her left arm under the silent water.\rThen she spoke to the bemused man, so: \xc3\x94Are you awake, Aeneas,\rchild of the gods? Be awake: loose the sheets: make full sail.\rWe are your fleet, now nymphs of the sea, once pines of Ida, \rfrom her sacred peak. Against our will we broke our bonds\rwhen the treacherous Rutulian was pressing us hard,\rwith fire and sword, and we have sought you over the waves.\rCybele, the Mother, refashioned us in this form, from pity,\rgranting that we became goddesses, spending life under the waves.\rNow, your son Ascanius is penned behind walls and ditches,\ramong weapons, and Latins bristling for a fight.\rThe Arcadian Horse, mixed with brave Etruscans already hold\rthe positions commanded: while Turnus\xc3\x95s certain purpose\ris to send his central squadrons against them, lest they reach the camp.\rUp then, in the rising dawn, call your friends with an order\rto arm, and take your invincible shield that the lord of fire\rgave you himself, that he circled with a golden rim.\rIf you don\xc3\x95t think my words idle, tomorrow\xc3\x95s light\rwill gaze on a mighty heap of Rutulian dead.\xc3\x95\rShe spoke, and, knowing how, with her right hand, \rthrust the high stern on, as she left: it sped through the waves\rfaster than a javelin, or an arrow equalling the wind.\rThen the others quickened speed. Amazed, the Trojan son\rof Anchises marvelled, yet his spirits lifted at the omen.\rThen looking up to the arching heavens he briefly prayed:\r\xc3\x94Kind Cybele, Mother of the gods, to whom Dindymus,\rtower-crowned cities, and harnessed lions are dear,\rbe my leader now in battle, duly further this omen,\rand be with your Trojans, goddess, with your favouring step.\xc3\x95\rHe prayed like this, and meanwhile the wheeling day\rrushed in with a flood of light, chasing away the night:\rfirst he ordered his comrades to obey his signals,\rprepare their spirits for fighting, and ready themselves for battle.\r\rBKX:260-307 AENEAS REACHES LAND\r\rNow, he stood on the high stern, with the Trojans and his fort\rin view, and at once lifted high the blazing shield, in his left hand.\rThe Trojans on the walls raised a shout to the sky, new hope \rfreshened their fury, they hurled their spears, just as Strymonian\rcranes under dark clouds, flying through the air, give noisy \rcries, and fleeing the south wind, trail their clamour.\rThis seemed strange to the Rutulian king and the Italian\rleaders, until looking behind them they saw the fleet \rturned towards shore, and the whole sea alive with ships.\rAeneas\xc3\x95s crest blazed, and a dark flame streamed from the top,\rand the shield\xc3\x95s gold boss spouted floods of fire:\rjust as when comets glow, blood-red and ominous in the clear night,\ror when fiery Sirius, bringer of drought and plague \rto frail mortals, rises and saddens the sky with sinister light.\rStill, brave Turnus did not lose hope of seizing the shore first,\rand driving the approaching enemy away from land.\rAnd he raised his men\xc3\x95s spirits as well, and chided them:\r\xc3\x94What you asked for in prayer is here, to break through \rwith the sword. Mars himself empowers your hands, men!\rNow let each remember his wife and home, now recall\rthe great actions, the glories of our fathers. And let\xc3\x95s \rmeet them in the waves, while they\xc3\x95re unsure and \rtheir first steps falter as they land. Fortune favours the brave.\xc3\x95\rSo he spoke, and asked himself whom to lead in attack\rand whom he could trust the siege of the walls. \rMeanwhile Aeneas landed his allies from the tall ships\rusing gangways. Many waited for the spent wave to ebb\rand trusted themselves to the shallow water: others rowed.\rTarchon, noting a strand where no waves heaved \rand no breaking waters roared, but the sea swept in\rsmoothly with the rising tide, suddenly turned \rhis prow towards it, exhorting his men: \r\xc3\x94Now, O chosen band, bend to your sturdy oars:\rlift, drive your boats, split this enemy shore \rwith your beaks, let the keel itself plough a furrow.\rI don\xc3\x95t shrink from wrecking the ship in such a harbour\ronce I\xc3\x95ve seized the land.\xc3\x95 When Tarchon had finished\rspeaking so, his comrades rose to the oars and drove \rtheir foam-wet ships onto the Latin fields,\rtill the rams gained dry ground and all the hulls\rcame to rest unharmed. But not yours, Tarchon,\rsince, striking the shallows, she hung on an uneven ridge\rpoised for a while, unbalanced, and, tiring the waves,\rbroke and pitched her crew into the water,\rbroken oars and floating benches obstructed them\rand at the same time the ebbing waves sucked at their feet.\r\rBKX:308-425 THE PITCHED BATTLE\r\rBut the long delay didn\xc3\x95t keep Turnus back: swiftly he moved\rhis whole front against the Trojans, and stood against them on the shore.\rThe trumpets sounded. Aeneas, first, attacked the ranks \rof farmers, as a sign of battle, and toppled the Latins,\rkilling Theron, noblest of men, who unprompted \rsought out Aeneas. The sword drank from his side, pierced\rthrough the bronze joints, and the tunic scaled with gold.\rThen he struck Lichas, who had been cut from the womb\rof his dead mother and consecrated to you, Phoebus: why\rwas he allowed to evade the blade at birth? Soon after,\rhe toppled in death tough Cisseus, and huge Gyas, as they\rlaid men low with their clubs: Hercules\xc3\x95s weapons \rwere no help, nor their stout hands nor Melampus their father,\rHercules\xc3\x95s friend, while earth granted him heavy labours.\rSee, Aeneas hurled his javelin as Pharus uttered \rwords in vain, and planted it in his noisy gullet.\rYou too, unhappy Cydon, as you followed Clytius, your new \rdelight, his cheeks golden with youthful down, you too\rwould have fallen beneath the Trojan hand, and lain there, \rwretched, free of that love of youth that was ever yours, \rhad the massed ranks of your brothers, not opposed him,\rthe children of Phorcus, seven in number, seven the spears\rthey threw: some glanced idly from helmet and shield,\rsome gentle Venus deflected, so they only grazed \rhis body. Aeneas spoke to faithful Achates:\r\xc3\x94Supply me with spears, those that lodged in the bodies\rof Greeks on Ilium\xc3\x95s plain: my right hand won\xc3\x95t hurl\rany at these Rutulians in vain.\xc3\x95 Then he grasped a great javelin\rand threw it: flying on, it crashed through the bronze\rof Maeon\xc3\x95s shield, smashing breastplate and breast in one go.\rHis brother Alcanor was there, supporting his brother \rwith his right arm as he fell: piercing the arm, the spear \rflew straight on, keeping its blood-wet course, \rand the lifeless arm hung by the shoulder tendons.\rThen Numitor, ripping the javelin from his brother\xc3\x95s body,\raimed at Aeneas: but he could not strike at him \rin return, and grazed great Achates\xc3\x95s thigh.\rNow Clausus of Cures approached, relying on his youthful\rstrength, and hit Dryopes under the chin from a distance away,\rwith his rigid spear, driven with force, and, piercing his throat \ras he spoke, took his voice and life together: he hit the ground\rwith his forehead, and spewed thick blood from his mouth.\rClausus toppled, in various ways, three Thracians too, \rof Boreas\xc3\x95s exalted race, and three whom Idas their father \rand their native Ismarus sent out. Halaesus ran to join him,\rand the Auruncan Band, and Messapus, Neptune\xc3\x95s scion,\rwith his glorious horses. Now one side, now the other strained\rto push back the enemy: the struggle was at the very \rthreshold of Italy. As warring winds, equal in force \rand purpose, rise to do battle in the vast heavens\rand between them neither yield either clouds or sea:\rthe battle is long in doubt, all things stand locked in conflict:\rso the ranks of Troy clashed with the Latin ranks,\rfoot against foot, man pressed hard against man.\rBut in another place, where a torrent had rolled and scattered \rboulders, with bushes torn from the banks, far and wide,\rPallas, seeing his Arcadians unused to charging in ranks\ron foot turning to run from the pursuing Latins, because \rthe nature of the ground, churned by water, had persuaded them to leave\rtheir horses for once, now with prayers, and now with bitter words,\rthe sole recourse in time of need, fired their courage:\r\xc3\x94Friends, where are you running to? Don\xc3\x95t trust to flight,\rby your brave deeds, by King Evander\xc3\x95s name,\rand the wars you\xc3\x95ve won, and my hopes, now seeking\rto emulate my father\xc3\x95s glory. We must hack a way through\rthe enemy with our swords. Your noble country calls you\rand your leader Pallas, to where the ranks of men are densest.\rNo gods attack us. We are mortals driven before a mortal foe:\rwe have as many lives, as many hands as they do.\rLook, the ocean closes us in with a vast barrier of water,\rthere\xc3\x95s no land left to flee to: shall we seek the seas or Troy?\xc3\x95\rHe spoke, and rushed into the midst of the close-packed enemy.\rLagus met him first, drawn there by a hostile fate.\rAs he tore at a huge weight of stone, Pallas pierced him \rwhere the spine parts the ribs in two, with the spear he hurled,\rand plucked out the spear again as it lodged in the bone.\rNor did Hisbo surprise him from above, hopeful though he was,\rsince, as he rushed in, raging recklessly at his friend\xc3\x95s cruel death,\rPallas intercepted him first, and buried his sword in his swollen chest.\rNext Pallas attacked Sthenius, and Anchemolus, of Rhoetus\xc3\x95s\rancient line, who had dared to violate his step-mother\xc3\x95s bed.\rYou, twin brothers, also fell in the Rutulian fields, Laridus\rand Thymber, the sons of Daucus, so alike you were \rindistinguishable to kin, and a dear confusion to your parents:\rbut now Pallas has given you a cruel separateness.\rFor Evander\xc3\x95s sword swept off your head, Thymber:\rwhile your right hand, Laridus, sought its owner,\rand the dying fingers twitched and clutched again at the sword.\rFired by his rebuke and seeing his glorious deeds, a mixture \rof remorse and pain roused the Arcadians against their enemy. \rThen Pallas pierced Rhoetus as he shot past in his chariot.\rIlus gained that much time and that much respite,\rsince he had launched his solid spear at Ilus from far off,\rwhich Rhoetus received, as he fled from you, noble Teuthras\rand your brother Tyres, and rolling from the chariot\rhe struck the Rutulian fields with his heels as he died.\rAs in summer, when a hoped-for wind has risen,\rthe shepherd sets scattered fires in the woods,\rthe spaces between catch light, and Vulcan\xc3\x95s bristling \rranks extend over the broad fields, while the shepherd sits\rand gazes down in triumph over the joyful flames:\rso all your comrades\xc3\x95 courage united as one \rto aid you Pallas. But Halaesus, fierce in war,\radvanced against them and gathered himself behind his shield.\rHe killed Ladon, Pheres and Demodocus, struck off\rStrymonius\xc3\x95s right hand, raised towards his throat,\rwith his shining sword, and smashed Thoas in the face \rwith a stone, scattering bone mixed with blood and brain.\rHalaesus\xc3\x95s father, prescient of fate, had hidden him in the woods:\rbut when, in white-haired old age, the father closed his eyes in death,\rthe Fates laid their hands on Halaesus and doomed him\rto Evander\xc3\x95s spear. Pallas attacked him first praying:\r\xc3\x94Grant luck to the spear I aim to throw, father Tiber, \rand a path through sturdy Halaesus\xc3\x95s chest. Your oak\rshall have the these weapons and the soldier\xc3\x95s spoils.\xc3\x95\rThe god heard his prayer: while Halaesus covered Imaon\rhe sadly exposed his unshielded chest to the Arcadian spear.\r\rBKX:426-509 THE DEATH OF PALLAS\r\rBut Lausus, a powerful force in the war, would not allow\rhis troops to be dismayed by the hero\xc3\x95s great slaughter:\rfirst he killed Abas opposite, a knotty obstacle in the battle.\rThe youth of Arcadia fell, the Etruscans fell, and you, \rO Trojans, men not even destroyed by the Greeks.\rThe armies met, equal in leadership and strength:\rthe rear and front closed ranks, and the crush prevented\rweapons or hands from moving. Here, Pallas pressed and urged,\rthere Lausus opposed him, not many years between them,\rboth of outstanding presence, but Fortune had denied them\ra return to their country. Yet the king of great Olympos\rdid not allow them to meet face to face: their fate \rwas waiting for them soon, at the hand of a greater opponent.\rMeanwhile Turnus\xc3\x95s gentle sister Juturna adjured him to help \rLausus, and he parted the ranks between in his swift chariot.\rWhen he saw his comrades he cried: \xc3\x94It\xc3\x95s time to hold back\rfrom the fight: it\xc3\x95s for me alone to attack Pallas, Pallas \ris mine alone: I wish his father were here to see it.\xc3\x95\rAnd his comrades drew back from the field as ordered.\rWhen the Rutulians retired, then the youth, amazed at that proud\rcommand, marvelled at Turnus, casting his eyes over \rthe mighty body, surveying all of him from the distance \rwith a fierce look, and answered the ruler\xc3\x95s words with these:\r\xc3\x94I\xc3\x95ll soon be praised for taking rich spoils, or for a glorious death:\rmy father is equal to either fate for me: away with your threats.\xc3\x95\rSo saying he marched down the centre of the field: \rthe blood gathered, chill, in Arcadian hearts.\rTurnus leapt from his chariot, preparing to close on foot,\rand the sight of the advancing Turnus, was no different\rthan that of a lion, seeing from a high point a bull far off \ron the plain contemplating battle, and rushing down.\rBut Pallas came forward first, when he thought Turnus might \rbe within spear-throw, so that chance might help him, in venturing\rhis unequal strength, and so he spoke to the mighty heavens:\r\xc3\x94I pray you, Hercules, by my father\xc3\x95s hospitality and the feast\rto which you came as a stranger, assist my great enterprise.\rLet me strip the blood-drenched armour from his dying limbs,\rand let Turnus\xc3\x95s failing sight meet its conqueror.\xc3\x95\rHercules heard the youth, and stifled a heavy sigh \rdeep in his heart, and wept tears in vain.\rThen Jupiter the father spoke to Hercules, his son,\rwith kindly words: \xc3\x94Every man has his day, the course\rof life is brief and cannot be recalled: but virtue\xc3\x95s task\ris this, to increase fame by deeds. So many sons of gods\rfell beneath the high walls of Troy, yes, and my own son\rSarpedon among them: fate calls even for Turnus,\rand he too has reached the end of the years granted to him.\xc3\x95\rSo he spoke, and turned his eyes from the Rutulian fields.\rThen Pallas threw his spear with all his might,\rand snatched his gleaming sword from its hollow sheath.\rThe shaft flew and struck Turnus, where the top of the armour\rlaps the shoulder, and forcing a way through the rim\rof his shield at last, even grazed his mighty frame.\rAt this, Turnus hurled his oak spear tipped \rwith sharp steel, long levelled at Pallas, saying:\r\xc3\x94See if this weapon of mine isn\xc3\x95t of greater sharpness.\xc3\x95\rThe spear-head, with a quivering blow, tore through\rthe centre of his shield, passed through all the layers \rof iron, of bronze, all the overlapping bull\xc3\x95s-hide,\rpiercing the breastplate, and the mighty chest.\rVainly he pulled the hot spear from the wound:\rblood and life followed, by one and the same path.\rHe fell in his own blood (his weapons clanged over him)\rand he struck the hostile earth in death with gory lips.\rThen Turnus, standing over him, cried out: \r\xc3\x94Arcadians, take note, and carry these words of mine\rto Evander: I return Pallas to him as he deserves.\rI freely give whatever honours lie in a tomb, whatever\rsolace there is in burial. His hospitality to Aeneas\rwill cost him greatly.\xc3\x95 So saying he planted his left foot on the corpse,\rand tore away the huge weight of Pallas\xc3\x95s belt, engraved \rwith the Danaids\xc3\x95 crime: that band of young men foully murdered\ron the same wedding night: the blood-drenched marriage chambers:\rthat Clonus, son of Eurytus had richly chased in gold.\rNow Turnus exulted at the spoil, and gloried in winning.\rOh, human mind, ignorant of fate or fortune to come,\ror of how to keep to the limits, exalted by favourable events!\rThe time will come for Turnus when he\xc3\x95d prefer to have bought\ran untouched Pallas at great price, and will hate those spoils\rand the day. So his friends crowded round Pallas with many \rgroans and tears, and carried him back, lying on his shield.\rO the great grief and glory in returning to your father:\rthat day first gave you to warfare, the same day took you from it,\rwhile nevertheless you left behind vast heaps of Rutulian dead!\r\rBKX:510-605 AENEAS RAGES IN BATTLE\r\rNow not merely a rumour of this great evil, but a more trustworthy\rmessenger flew to Aeneas, saying that his men were a hair\xc3\x95s breadth \rfrom death, that it was time to help the routed Trojans. Seeking you,\rTurnus, you, proud of your fresh slaughter, he mowed down \rhis nearest enemies, with the sword, and fiercely drove a wide path\rthrough the ranks with its blade. Pallas, Evander, all was before \rhis eyes, the feast to which he had first come as a stranger,\rthe right hands pledged in friendship. Then he captured\rfour youths alive, sons of Sulmo, and as many reared \rby Ufens, to sacrifice to the shades of the dead, and sprinkle\rthe flames of the pyre with the prisoners\xc3\x95 blood. \rNext he aimed a hostile spear at Magus from a distance:\rMagus moved in cleverly, and the spear flew over him, quivering,\rand he clasped the hero\xc3\x95s knees as a suppliant, and spoke as follows:\r\xc3\x94I beg you, by your father\xc3\x95s shade, by your hope in your boy \rIulus, preserve my life, for my son and my father.\rI have a noble house: talents of chased silver lie buried there:\rI have masses of wrought and unwrought gold. Troy\xc3\x95s victory\rdoes not rest with me: one life will not make that much difference.\xc3\x95\rAeneas replied to him in this way: \xc3\x94Keep those many talents\rof silver and gold you mention for your sons. Turnus, before we spoke,\rdid away with the courtesies of war, the moment he killed Pallas.\rSo my father Anchises\xc3\x95s spirit thinks, so does Iulus.\xc3\x95\rSaying this he held the helmet with his left hand and, bending\rthe suppliant\xc3\x95s neck backwards, drove in his sword to the hilt.\rHaemon\xc3\x95s son, a priest of Apollo and Diana, was not far away,\rthe band with its sacred ribbons circling his temples, and all \rhis robes and emblems shining white. Aeneas met him and drove him\rover the plain, then, standing over the fallen man, killed him and cloaked\rhim in mighty darkness: Serestus collected and carried off \rhis weapons on his shoulders, a trophy for you, King Gradivus.\rCaeculus, born of the race of Vulcan, and Umbro \rwho came from the Marsian hills restored order, \rthe Trojan raged against them: his sword sliced off Anxur\xc3\x95s\rleft arm, it fell to the ground with the whole disc of his shield\r(Anxur had shouted some boast, trusting the power \rof words, lifting his spirit high perhaps, promising\rhimself white-haired old age and long years):\rthen Tarquitus nearby, proud in his gleaming armour,\rwhom the nymph Dryope had born to Faunus of the woods,\rexposed himself to fiery Aeneas. He, drawing back his spear,\rpinned the breastplate and the huge weight of shield together:\rthen as the youth begged in vain, and tried to utter a flow of words,\rhe struck his head to the ground and, rolling the warm trunk over,\rspoke these words above him, from a hostile heart:\r\xc3\x94Lie there now, one to be feared. No noble mother will bury you\rin the earth, nor weight your limbs with an ancestral tomb:\ryou\xc3\x95ll be left for the carrion birds, or, sunk in the abyss,\rthe flood will bear you, and hungry fish suck your wounds.\xc3\x95\rThen he caught up with Antaeus, and Lucas, in Turnus\xc3\x95s\rfront line, brave Numa and auburn Camers, son of noble Volcens,\rthe wealthiest in Ausonian land, who ruled silent Amyclae.\rOnce his sword was hot, victorious Aeneas raged \rover the whole plain, like Aegeaon, who had a hundred \rarms and a hundred hands they say, and breathed fire\rfrom fifty chests and mouths, when he clashed \rwith as many like shields of his and drew as many swords\ragainst Jove\xc3\x95s lightning-bolts. See now he was headed \rtowards the four horse team of Niphaeus\xc3\x95s chariot \rand the opposing front. And when the horses saw him taking \rgreat strides in his deadly rage, they shied and galloped in fear,\rthrowing their master, and dragging the chariot to the shore.\rMeanwhile Lucagus and his brother Liger entered the fray\rin their chariot with two white horses: Liger handling \rthe horses\xc3\x95 reins, fierce Lucagus waving his naked sword.\rAeneas could not tolerate such furious hot-headedness:\rhe rushed at them, and loomed up gigantic with levelled spear.\rLiger said to him: \xc3\x94These are not Diomedes\xc3\x95s horses \rthat you see, nor Achille\xc3\x95s chariot, nor Phrygia\xc3\x95s plain:\rnow you\xc3\x95ll be dealt an end to your war and life.\xc3\x95 \rSuch were the words that flew far, from foolish\rLiger\xc3\x95s lips. But the Trojan hero did not ready \rwords in reply, he hurled his spear then against his enemies.\rWhile Lucagus urged on his horses, leaning forward\rtowards the spear\xc3\x95s blow, as, with left foot advanced,\rhe prepared himself for battle, the spear entered the lower \rrim of his bright shield, then pierced the left thigh:\rthrown from the chariot he rolled on the ground in death:\rwhile noble Aeneas spoke bitter words to him:\r\xc3\x94Lucagus, it was not the flight of your horses in fear that betrayed\r your chariot, or the enemy\xc3\x95s idle shadow that turned them:\rit was you, leaping from the wheels, who relinquished the reins.\xc3\x95 \rSo saying he grasped at the chariot: the wretched brother, \rLiger, who had fallen as well, held, out his helpless hands:\r\xc3\x94Trojan hero, by your own life, by your parents who bore\rsuch a son, take pity I beg you, without taking this life away.\xc3\x95 \rAs he begged more urgently, Aeaneas said: \xc3\x94Those were not\rthe words you spoke before. Die and don\xc3\x95t let brother desert brother.\xc3\x95\rThen he sliced open his chest where the life is hidden.\rSuch were the deaths the Trojan leader caused across \rthat plain, raging like a torrent of water or a dark\rtempest. At last his child, Ascanius, and the men \rwho were besieged in vain, breaking free, left the camp.\r\rBKX:606-688 JUNO WITHDRAWS TURNUS FROM THE FIGHT\r\rMeanwhile Jupiter, unasked, spoke to Juno:\r\xc3\x94O my sister, and at the same time my dearest wife,\ras you thought (your judgement is not wrong)\rit is Venus who sustains the Trojans\xc3\x95 power, \rnot their own right hands, so ready for war,\rnor their fierce spirits, tolerant of danger.\xc3\x95\rJuno spoke submissively to him: \xc3\x94O loveliest of husbands\rwhy do you trouble me, who am ill, and fearful of your \rharsh commands? If my love had the power it once had,\rthat is my right, you, all-powerful, would surely not\rdeny me this, to withdraw Turnus from the conflict\rand save him, unharmed, for his father, Daunus.\rLet him die then, let him pay the Trojans in innocent blood.\rYet he derives his name from our line: Pilumnus \rwas his ancestor four generations back, and often weighted\ryour threshold with copious gifts from a lavish hand.\xc3\x95\rThe king of heavenly Olympus briefly replied to her like this:\r\xc3\x94If your prayer is for reprieve from imminent death\rfor your doomed prince, and you understand I so ordain it,\rtake Turnus away, in flight, snatch him from oncoming fate:\rthere\xc3\x95s room for that much indulgence. But if thought\rof any greater favour hides behind your prayers, and you think\rthis whole war may be deflected or altered, you nurture a vain hope.\xc3\x95\rAnd Juno, replied, weeping: \xc3\x94Why should your mind not grant\rwhat your tongue withholds, and life be left to Turnus?\rNow, guiltless, a heavy doom awaits him or I stray empty\rof truth. Oh, that I might be mocked by false fears, \rand that you, who are able to, might harbour kinder speech!\rWhen she had spoken these words, she darted down at once\rfrom high heaven through the air, driving a storm before her,\rand wreathed in cloud, and sought the ranks of Ilium \rand the Laurentine camp. Then from the cavernous mist\rthe goddess decked out a weak and tenuous phantom,\rin the likeness of Aeneas, with Trojan weapons (a strange\rmarvel to behold), simulated his shield, and the plumes\ron his godlike head, gave it insubstantial speech,\rgave it sound without mind, and mimicked the way \rhe walked: like shapes that flit, they say, after death, \ror dreams that in sleep deceive the senses. \rAnd the phantom flaunted itself exultantly\rin front of the leading ranks, provoking Turnus \rwith spear casts, and exasperating him with words. \rTurnus ran at it, and hurled a hissing spear \rfrom the distance: it turned its heels in flight.\rThen, as Turnus thought that Aeneas had retreated\rand conceded, and in his confusion clung to this idle hope \rin his mind, he cried: \xc3\x94Where are you off to, Aeneas?\rDon\xc3\x95t desert your marriage pact: this hand of mine\rwill grant you the earth you looked for over the seas.\xc3\x95\rHe pursued him, calling loudly, brandishing his naked sword,\rnot seeing that the wind was carrying away his glory.\rIt chanced that the ship, in which King Osinius sailed\rfrom Clusium\xc3\x95s shores, was moored to a high stone pier,\rwith ladders released and gangway ready. The swift phantom\rof fleeing Aeneas sank into it to hide, and Turnus followed \rno less swiftly, conquering all obstacles and leapt \rup the high gangway. He had barely reached the prow\rwhen Saturn\xc3\x95s daughter snapped the cable,\rand, snatching the ship, swept it over the waters.\rThen the vague phantom no longer tried to hide\rbut, flying into the air, merged with a dark cloud.\rMeanwhile Aeneas himself was challenging his missing enemy\rto battle: and sending many opposing warriors to their deaths,\rwhile the storm carried Turnus over the wide ocean.\rUnaware of the truth, and ungrateful for his rescue,\rhe looked back and raised clasped hands and voice to heaven:\r\xc3\x94All-powerful father, did you think me so worthy of punishment,\rdid you intend me to pay such a price? Where am I being taken?\rFrom whom am I escaping? Why am I fleeing: how will I return?\rWill I see the walls and camp of Laurentium again?\rWhat of that company of men that followed me, and my standard?\rHave I left them all (the shame of it) to a cruel death,\rseeing them scattered now, hearing the groans as they fall?\rWhat shall I do? Where is the earth that could gape \rwide enough for me? Rather have pity on me, O winds:\rDrive the ship on the rocks, the reefs (I, Turnus, beg you, freely)\ror send it into the vicious quicksands, where no Rutulian,\rnor any knowing rumour of my shame can follow me?\rSo saying he debated this way and that in his mind,\rwhether he should throw himself on his sword, mad\rwith such disgrace, and drive the cruel steel through his ribs,\ror plunge into the waves, and, by swimming, gain \rthe curving bay, and hurl himself again at the Trojan weapons.\rThree times he attempted each: three times great Juno\rheld him back, preventing him from heartfelt pity. He glided on, \rwith the help of wave and tide, cutting the depths, \rand was carried to his father Daunus\xc3\x95s ancient city.\r\rBKX:689-754 MEZENTIUS RAGES IN BATTLE\r \rBut meanwhile fiery Mezentius, warned by Jupiter,\rtook up the fight, and attacked the jubilant Trojans.\rThe Etruscan ranks closed up, and concentrated\rall their hatred, and showers of missiles, on him alone.\rHe (like a vast cliff that juts out into the vast deep,\rconfronting the raging winds, and exposed to the waves,\rsuffering the force and threat of sky and sea,\ritself left unshaken) felled Hebrus, son of Dolichaon,\rto the earth, with him were Latagus and swift Palmus,\rbut he anticipated Latagus, with a huge fragment of rock\rfrom the hillside in his mouth and face, while he hamstrung\rPalmus and left him writhing helplessly: he gave Lausus the armour \rto protect his shoulders, and the plumes to wear on his crest.\rHe killed Evanthes too, the Phrygian, and Mimas, Paris\xc3\x95s\rfriend and peer, whom Theano bore to his father Amycus\ron the same night Hecuba, Cisseus\xc3\x95s royal daughter, pregnant\rwith a firebrand, gave birth to Paris: Paris lies in the city \rof his fathers, the Laurentine shore holds the unknown Mimas.\rAnd as a boar, that piny Vesulus has sheltered \rfor many years and Laurentine marshes have nourished\rwith forests of reeds, is driven from the high hills, \rby snapping hounds, and halts when it reaches the nets,\rsnorts fiercely, hackles bristling, no one brave enough \rto rage at it, or approach it, but all attacking it with spears, \rand shouting from a safe distance: halts, unafraid,\rturning in every direction, grinding its jaws,\rand shaking the spears from its hide: so none of those \rwho were rightly angered with Mezentius had the courage \rto meet him with naked sword, but provoked him \rfrom afar with their missiles, and a mighty clamour.\rAcron, a Greek had arrived there from the ancient lands\rof Corythus, an exile, his marriage ceremony left incomplete.\rWhen Mezentius saw him in the distance, embroiled\ramong the ranks, with crimson plumes, and in purple robes\rgiven by his promised bride, he rushed eagerly into the thick\rof the foe, as a ravenous lion often ranges the high coverts\r(since a raging hunger drives it) and exults, with vast gaping jaws,\rif it chances to see a fleeing roe-deer, or a stag with immature horns,\rthen clings crouching over the entrails, with bristling mane,\rits cruel mouth stained hideously with blood.\rWretched Acron fell, striking the dark earth with his heels\rin dying, drenching his shattered weapons with blood.\rAnd he did not even deign to kill Orodes as he fled,\ror inflict a hidden wound with a thrust of his spear:\rhe ran to meet him on the way, and opposed him man to man,\rgetting the better of him by force of arms not stealth.\rThen setting his foot on the fallen man, and straining at his spear,\rhe called out: \xc3\x94Soldiers, noble Orodes lies here, he was no small part\rof this battle.\xc3\x95 His comrades shouted, taking up the joyful cry:\rYet Orodes, dying, said: \xc3\x94Whoever you are, winner here, \rI\xc3\x95ll not go unavenged, nor will you rejoice for long: \ra like fate watches for you: you\xc3\x95ll soon lie in these same fields.\xc3\x95\rMezentius replied, grinning with rage: \xc3\x94Die now,\ras for me, the father of gods and king of men will see to that.\xc3\x95\rSo saying he withdrew his spear from the warrior\xc3\x95s body.\rEnduring rest, and iron sleep, pressed on Orodes\xc3\x95s eyes,\rand their light was shrouded in eternal night.\rCaedicus killed Alcathous: Sacrator killed Hydapses:\rRapo killed Parthenius, and Orses of outstanding strength.\rMessapus killed Clonius, and Ericetes, son of Lycaon,\rone lying on the ground fallen from his bridle-less horse,\rthe other still on his feet. Lycian Agis had advanced his feet\rbut Valerus overthrew him, with no lack of his ancestors\xc3\x95 skill:\rSalius killed Thronius, and Nealces, famed for the javelin,\rand the deceptive long-distance arrow, in turn killed Salcius.\r\rBKX:755-832 THE DEATH OF MEZENTIUS\xc3\x95S SON, LAUSUS\r\rNow grievous War dealt grief and death mutually:\rthey killed alike, and alike they died, winners and losers,\rand neither one nor the other knew how to flee.\rThe gods in Jupiter\xc3\x95s halls pitied the useless anger of them both,\rand that such pain existed for mortal beings:\rhere Venus gazed down, here, opposite, Saturnian Juno.\rPale Tisiphone raged among the warring thousands. \rAnd now Mezentius shaking his mighty spear,\radvanced like a whirlwind over the field. Great as Orion,\rwhen he strides through Ocean\xc3\x95s deepest chasms, forging a way,\rhis shoulders towering above the waves, or carrying \ran ancient manna ash down from the mountain heights, \rwalking the earth, with his head hidden in the clouds,\rso Mezentius advanced in his giant\xc3\x95s armour.\rAeneas, opposite, catching sight of him in the far ranks\rprepared to go and meet him. Mezentius stood there unafraid,\rwaiting for his great-hearted enemy, firm in his great bulk:\rand measuring with his eye what distance would suit his spear,\rsaying: \xc3\x94Now let this right hand that is my god, and the weapon\rI level to throw, aid me! I vow that you yourself, Lausus, as token\rof my victory over Aeneas, shall be dressed in the spoils stripped \rfrom that robber\xc3\x95s corpse.\xc3\x95 He spoke, and threw the hissing spear \rfrom far out. But, flying on, it glanced from the shield, \rand pierced the handsome Antores, nearby, between flank\rand thigh, Antores, friend of Hercules, sent from Argos\rwho had joined Evander, and settled in an Italian city.\rUnhappy man, he fell to a wound meant for another, \rand dying, gazing at the sky, remembered sweet Argos.\rThen virtuous Aeneas hurled a spear: it passed through \rMezentius\xc3\x95s curved shield of triple-bronze, through linen, \rand the interwoven layers of three bull\xc3\x95s hides, and lodged\rdeep in the groin, but failed to drive home with force.\rAeneas, joyful at the sight of the Tuscan blood, \rsnatched the sword from his side, and pressed \rhis shaken enemy hotly. Lausus, seeing it, groaned heavily\rfor love of his father, and tears rolled down his cheeks \xc3\x90 \rand here I\xc3\x95ll not be silent, for my part, about your harsh death,\rthrough fate, nor, if future ages place belief in such deeds, your actions, \rso glorious, nor you yourself, youth, worthy of remembrance \xc3\x90 \rhis father was retreating, yielding ground, helpless,\rhampered, dragging the enemy lance along with his shield.\rThe youth ran forward, and plunged into the fray,\rand, just as Aeneas\xc3\x95s right hand lifted to strike a blow,\rhe snatched at the sword-point, and checked him in delay:\rhis friends followed with great clamour, and, with a shower \rof spears, forced the enemy to keep his distance till the father\rcould withdraw, protected by his son\xc3\x95s shield.\rAeneas raged, but kept himself under cover.\rAs every ploughman and farmer runs from the fields\rwhen storm-clouds pour down streams of hail,\rand the passer by shelters in a safe corner, under a river \rbank or an arch of high rock, while the rain falls to earth, \rso as to pursue the day\xc3\x95s work when the sun returns:\rso, overwhelmed by missiles from every side, \rAeneas endured the clouds of war, while they all thundered,\rand rebuked Lausus, and threatened Lausus, saying:\r\xc3\x94Why are you rushing to death, with courage beyond your strength?\rYour loyalty\xc3\x95s betraying you to foolishness.\xc3\x95 Nevertheless\rthe youth raged madly, and now fierce anger rose higher\rin the Trojan leader\xc3\x95s heart, and the Fates gathered together\rthe last threads of Lausus\xc3\x95s life. For Aeneas drove his sword\rfirmly through the youth\xc3\x95s body, and buried it to the hilt:\rthe point passed through his shield, too light for his threats,\rand the tunic of soft gold thread his mother had woven,\rblood filled its folds: then life left the body and fled, \rsorrowing, through the air to the spirits below.\rAnd when Anchises\xc3\x95s son saw the look on his dying face,\rthat face pale with the wonderment of its ending,\rhe groaned deeply with pity and stretched out his hand,\ras that reflection of his own love for his father touched \rhis heart. \xc3\x94Unhappy child, what can loyal Aeneas grant\rto such a nature, worthy of these glorious deeds of yours?\rKeep the weapons you delighted in: and if it is something you are\ranxious about, I return you to the shades and ashes of your ancestors. \rThis too should solace you, unhappy one, for your sad death:\ryou died at the hands of great Aeneas.\xc3\x95 Also he rebuked \rLausus\xc3\x95s comrades, and lifted their leader from the earth, \rwhere he was soiling his well-ordered hair with blood.\r\rBKX:833-908 THE DEATH OF MEZENTIUS\r\rMeanwhile the father, Mezentius, staunched his wounds\rby the waters of Tiber\xc3\x95s river, and rested his body \rby leaning against a tree trunk. His bronze helmet hung\ron a nearby branch, and his heavy armour lay peacefully on the grass.\rThe pick of his warriors stood around: he himself, weak and panting\reased his neck, his flowing beard streaming over his chest.\rMany a time he asked for Lausus, and many times sent men \rto carry him a sorrowing father\xc3\x95s orders and recall him.\rBut his weeping comrades were carrying the dead Lausus, \ron his armour, a great man conquered by a mighty wound.\rThe mind prescient of evil, knew their sighs from far off.\rMezentius darkened his white hair with dust, and lifted\rboth hands to heaven, clinging to the body:\r\xc3\x94My son, did such delight in living possess me,\rthat I let you face the enemy force in my place,\ryou whom I fathered? Is this father of yours alive\rthrough your death, saved by your wounds? Ah, now at last \rmy exile is wretchedly driven home: and my wound, deeply!\rMy son, I have also tarnished your name by my crime,\rdriven in hatred from my fathers\xc3\x95 throne and sceptre.\rI have long owed reparation to my country and my people\xc3\x95s hatred:\rI should have yielded my guilty soul to death in any form!\rNow I live: I do not leave humankind yet, or the light,\rbut I will leave.\xc3\x95 So saying he raised himself weakly on his thigh,\rand, despite all, ordered his horse to be brought, though his strength\rebbed from the deep wound. His mount was his pride, \rand it was his solace, on it he had ridden victorious from every battle.\rHe spoke to the sorrowful creature, in these words:\r\xc3\x94Rhaebus, we have lived a long time, if anything lasts long\rfor mortal beings. Today you will either carry the head of Aeneas,\rand his blood-stained spoils, in victory, and avenge Lausus\xc3\x95s pain\rwith me, or die with me, if no power opens that road to us:\rI don\xc3\x95t think that you, the bravest of creatures, will deign\rto suffer a stranger\xc3\x95s orders or a Trojan master.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke, then, mounting, disposed his limbs as usual,\rand weighted each hand with a sharp javelin,\rhis head gleaming with bronze, bristling with its horsehair crest.\rSo he launched himself quickly into the fray. In that one heart\ra vast flood of shame and madness merged with grief.\rAnd now he called to Aeneas in a great voice.\rAeneas knew him and offered up a joyous prayer:\r\xc3\x94So let the father of the gods himself decree it, so\rnoble Apollo! You then begin the conflict\xc3\x89.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke those words and moved against him with level spear.\rBut Mezentius replied: \xc3\x94How can you frighten me, most savage \rof men, me, bereft of my son? That was the only way you could\rdestroy me: I do not shrink from death, or halt for any god.\rCease, since I come here to die, and bring you, first,\rthese gifts.\xc3\x95 He spoke, and hurled a spear at his enemy:\rthen landed another and yet another, wheeling \rin a wide circle, but the gilded shield withstood them.\rHe rode three times round his careful enemy, widdershins,\rthrowing darts from his hand: three times the Trojan hero\rdragged round the huge thicket of spears fixed in his bronze shield.\rThen tired of all that drawn-out delay, and burdened \rby the unequal conflict, he thought hard, and finally broke free,\rhurling his spear straight between the war horse\xc3\x95s curved temples.\rThe animal reared, and lashed the air with its hooves,\rand throwing its rider, followed him down, from above,\rentangling him, collapsing headlong onto him, its shoulder thrown.\rTrojans and Latins ignited the heavens with their shouts.\rAeneas ran to him, plucking his sword from its sheath\rand standing over him, cried: \xc3\x94Where is fierce Mezentius, now,\rand the savage force of that spirit?\xc3\x95 The Tuscan replied, as, lifting\rhis eyes to the sky, and gulping the air, he regained his thoughts:\r\xc3\x94Bitter enemy, why taunt, or threaten me in death?\rThere is no sin in killing: I did not come to fight believing so,\rnor did my Lausus agree any treaty between you and me.\rI only ask, by whatever indulgence a fallen enemy might claim,\rthat my body be buried in the earth. I know that my people\xc3\x95s\rfierce hatred surrounds me: protect me, I beg you, \rfrom their anger, and let me share a tomb with my son.\xc3\x95\rSo he spoke, and in full awareness received the sword in his throat,\rand poured out his life, over his armour, in a wave of blood.\r\r\r\n\r\rBOOK XI\r\r\rBKXI:1-99 AENEAS MOURNS PALLAS\r\rMeanwhile Dawn rose and left the ocean waves:\rthough Aeneas\xc3\x95s sorrow urged him to spend his time\ron his comrades\xc3\x95 burial, and his mind was burdened by death,\ras victor, at first light, he discharged his vows to the gods.\rHe planted a great oak trunk, its branches lopped all round,\ron a tumulus, and decked it out as a trophy to you, great god of war, \rin the gleaming armour stripped from the leader, Mezentius: \rhe fastened the crests to it, dripping with blood, the warrior\xc3\x95s\rbroken spears, and the battered breastplate, pierced \rin twelve places: he tied the bronze shield to its left side, \rand hung the ivory-hilted sword from its neck.\rThen he began to encourage his rejoicing comrades:\r\xc3\x94We have done great things, men: banish all fear of what\xc3\x95s left\rto do: these are the spoils of a proud king, the first fruits of victory,\rand this is Mezentius, fashioned by my hands.\rNow our path is towards King Latinus and his city walls.\rLook to your weapons, spiritedly, make war your expectation,\rso when the gods above give us the sign to take up our standards,\rand lead out our soldiers from the camp, no delay may halt us\runawares, or wavering purpose hold us back through fear.\rMeanwhile let us commit to earth the unburied bodies\rof our friends, the only tribute recognised in Acheron\xc3\x95s depths.\rGo,\xc3\x95 he said, \xc3\x94grace these noble spirits with your last gifts,\rwho have won this country for us with their blood,\rand first let Pallas\xc3\x95s body be sent to Evander\xc3\x95s grieving city,\rhe, whom a black day stole, though no way lacking\rin courage, and plunged in death\xc3\x95s bitterness.\xc3\x95\rSo he spoke, weeping, and retraced his steps to the threshold\rwhere Pallas\xc3\x95s lifeless corpse was laid, watched\rby old Acoetes, who before had been armour-bearer\rto Arcadian Evander, but then, under less happy auspices,\rset out as the chosen guardian for his dear foster-child.\rAll the band of attendants, and the Trojan crowd, stood around,\rand the Ilian women, hair loosened as customary in mourning.\rAs Aeneas entered the tall doorway they struck \rtheir breasts, and raised a great cry to the heavens, \rand the royal pavilion rang with sad lamentation. \rWhen he saw the pillowed face and head of Pallas,\rpale as snow, and the open wound of the Ausonian spear\rin his smooth chest, he spoke, his tears rising:\r\xc3\x94Unhappy child, when Fortune entered smiling was it she\rwho begrudged you to me, so that you would not see \rmy kingdom, or ride, victorious, to your father\xc3\x95s house?  \rThis was not the last promise I made your father, Evander,\ron leaving, when he embraced me, sending me off\rto win a great empire, and warned me with trepidation\rthat the enemy were brave, a tough race.\rAnd now, greatly deluded by false hopes, he perhaps\ris making vows, piling the altars high with gifts,\rwhile we, grieving, follow his son in vain procession,\rone who no longer owes any debt to the gods.\rUnhappy one, you will see the bitter funeral of your child!\rIs this how we return, is this our hoped-for triumph?\rIs this what my great promise amounted to? \rYet, Evander, your eyes will not see a son struck down\rwith shameful wounds, nor be a father praying for death,\raccursed because your son came home alive. Alas, how great\rwas the protector, who is lost to you, Ausonia, and you, Iulus.\xc3\x95\rWhen he had ended his lament, he ordered them to lift\rthe sad corpse, and he sent a thousand men, chosen\rfrom the ranks, to attend the last rites, and share the father\xc3\x95s tears,\ra meagre solace for so great a grief, but owed a father\xc3\x95s sorrow.\rOthers, without delay, interwove the frame of a bier \rwith twigs of oak, and shoots of arbutus, shading \rthe bed they constructed with a covering of leaves.\rHere they placed the youth high on his rustic couch:\rlike a flower plucked by a young girl\xc3\x95s fingers,\ra sweet violet or a drooping hyacinth, whose brightness\rand beauty have not yet faded, but whose native earth \rno longer nourishes it, or gives it strength.\rThen Aeneas brought two robes of rigid gold and purple\rthat Sidonian Dido had made for him once, with her own hands,\rdelighting in the labour, interweaving the fabric with gold thread.\rSorrowing, he draped the youth with one of these as a last honour,\rand veiled that hair, which would be burned, with its cloth,\rand heaped up many gifts as well from the Laurentine battle\rand ordered the spoils to be carried in a long line:\rhe added horses and weapons stripped from the enemy.\rHe had the hands of those he sent as offerings to the shades,\rto sprinkle the flames with blood in dying, bound behind their backs,\rand ordered the leaders themselves to carry tree-trunks\rdraped with enemy weapons, with the names of the foe attached.\rUnhappy Acoetes, wearied with age, was led along, \rnow bruising his chest with his fists, now marring his face \rwith his nails, until he fell, full-length on the ground:\rand they led chariots drenched with Rutulian blood.\rBehind went the war-horse, Aethon, without his trappings,\rmourning, wetting his face with great tear drops.\rOthers carried Pallas\xc3\x95s spear and helmet, the rest Turnus\rheld as victor. Then a grieving procession followed,\rTrojans, Etruscans, and Arcadians with weapons reversed.\rWhen all the ranks of his comrades had advanced far ahead,\rAeneas halted, and added this, with a deep sigh:\r\xc3\x94This same harsh fate of warfare calls me from here\rto other weeping: my salute for eternity to you, noble Pallas,\rand for eternity, farewell.\xc3\x95 Without speaking more he turned\rhis steps toward the camp and headed for the walls.\r\rBKXI:100-138 AENEAS OFFERS PEACE\r\rAnd now ambassadors, shaded with olive branches, \rcame from the Latin city, seeking favours: they asked him \rto return the bodies of men, felled by the sword, overflowing \rthe plain, and allow them to be buried under a mound of earth.\rthere could be no quarrel with the lost, devoid of the light:\rlet him spare those who were once hosts and fathers of brides.\rAeneas courteously granted prayers he could not refuse,\rand added these words as well: \xc3\x94Latins, what shameful \rmischance has entangled you in a war like this, \rso that you fly from being our friends? Do you \rseek peace for your dead killed by fate in battle?\rI would gladly grant it to the living too. I would not\rbe here, if fate had not granted me a place, a home,\rnor do I wage war on your people: your king abandoned \rour friendship, and thought Turnus\xc3\x95s army greater.\rIt would have been more just for Turnus himself to meet \rthis death. If he seeks to end the war by force, and drive out\rthe Trojans, he should have fought me with these weapons, he \rwhom the gods, or his right hand granted life, would have survived. \rNow go and light the fires for your unfortunate countrymen.\xc3\x95\rAeneas had spoken. They were silent, struck dumb,\rand kept their faces and their gaze fixed on one another.\rThen Drances, an elder, always hostile to young Turnus,\rshown in his dislike and reproaches, replied in turn, so:\r\xc3\x94O, Trojan hero, great in fame, greater in battle,\rhow can I praise you to the skies enough? Should I \rwonder first at your justice, or your efforts in war?\rIndeed we will gratefully carry these words back \rto our native city, and if Fortune offers a way, we will\rally you to our king. Let Turnus seek treaties for himself.\rIt will be a delight even to raise those massive walls\rand lift the stones of Troy on our shoulders.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke, and they all murmured assent with one voice.\rThey fixed a twelve day truce, and with peace as mediator,\rTrojans and Latins wandered together, in safety, \rthrough the wooded hills. The tall ash rang to the two-edged axe,\rthey felled pine-trees towering to the heavens, and they never \rceased splitting the oaks, and fragrant cedars, with wedges,\ror carrying away the manna ash in rumbling wagons.\rBKXI:139-181 EVANDER MOURNS PALLAS\r\rAnd now Rumour filled Evander\xc3\x95s ears, and the palace\xc3\x95s \rand the city\xc3\x95s, flying there, bringing news of that great grief:\rRumour, that a moment since was carrying Pallas\xc3\x95s victory\rto Latium. The Arcadians ran to the gates, and following \rancient custom, seized torches for the funeral: the road shone\rwith the long ranks of flames, parting the distant fields.\rThe Trojan column, approaching, merged its files of mourners\rwith them. When the women saw them nearing \rthe houses, grief set the city ablaze with its clamour.\rBut no force could restrain Evander, and he ran into their midst,\rflung himself on Pallas\xc3\x95s body, once the bier was set down,\rclinging to it with tears and groans, till at last, he spoke,\rhis grief scarcely allowing a path for his voice:\r\xc3\x94O Pallas, this was not the promise you made your father,\rthat you would enter this savage war with caution.\rI am not ignorant how great new pride in weapons\rcan be, and honour won in a first conflict is very sweet.\rAlas for the first fruits of your young life, and your\rharsh schooling in a war so near us, and for my vows\rand prayers unheard by any god! Happy were you, O my \rmost sacred Queen, in a death that saved you from this sorrow!\rI, by living on, have exceeded my fate, to survive as father\rwithout son. I should have marched with the allied armies \rof Troy and been killed by those Rutulian spears! I should have\rgiven my life, and this pomp should have carried me, not Pallas, home!\rYet I do not blame you, Trojans, or our treaty, or the hands\rwe clasped in friendship: my white hairs are the cause of this.\rAnd if an untimely death awaited my son it is my joy that he fell\rleading the Trojans into Latium, killing Volscians in thousands.\rIndeed, Pallas, I thought you worthy of no other funeral \rthan this that virtuous Aeneas, the great Phyrgians, \rthe Etruscan leaders and all the Etruscans chose.  \rThose, whom your right hand dealt death to, bring great trophies:\rTurnus, you too would be standing here, a vast tree-trunk hung with\rweapons, if years and mature strength had been alike in both.\rBut why in my unhappiness do I keep the Trojans from war? \rGo, and remember to take this message to your king:\rif I prolong a life that\xc3\x95s hateful to me, now Pallas is dead,\rit\xc3\x95s because you know your right hand owes father and son \rthe death of Turnus. That is the one path of kindness to me \rand success for you that lies open. I don\xc3\x95t ask for joy while alive,\r(that\xc3\x95s not allowed me) but to carry it to my son deep among the shades.\xc3\x95\r\rBKXI:182-224 THE FUNERAL PYRES\r\rDawn, meanwhile, had raised her kindly light on high\rfor wretched men, calling them again to work and toil:\rnow Aeneas the leader, now Tarchon, had erected pyres\ron the curving bay. Here according to ancestral custom they each \rbrought the bodies of their people, and as the gloomy fires \rwere lit beneath, the high sky was veiled in a dark mist.\rThree times they circled the blazing piles, clad in gleaming\rarmour, three times they rounded the mournful \rfuneral flames on horseback, and uttered wailing cries.\rTears sprinkled the earth, and sprinkled the armour,\rthe clamour of men and blare of trumpets climbed to the heavens.\rThen some flung spoils, stripped from the slaughtered Latins,\ronto the fire, helmets and noble swords, bridles and swift wheels:\rothers, gifts familiar to the dead, their shields and luckless weapons.\rMany head of cattle were sacrificed round these, to Death.\rThey cut the throats of bristling boars, and flocks culled \rfrom the whole country, over the flames. Then they watched \rtheir comrades burn, all along the shore, and kept guard \rover the charred pyres, and could not tear themselves away\rtill dew-wet night wheeled the sky round, inset with shining stars.\rElsewhere too the wretched Latins built innumerable pyres.\rSome of the many corpses they buried in the earth, some they took\rand carried to the fields nearby, or sent onwards to the city. \rThe rest, a vast pile of indiscriminate dead, they burnt\rwithout count, and without honours: then the wide fields\ron every side shone thick with fires, in emulation.\rThe third dawn dispelled chill shadows from the sky:\rgrieving, they raked the bones, mixed with a depth of ash,\rfrom the pyres, and heaped a mound of warm earth over them.\rMeanwhile, the main clamour, and the heart of their prolonged \rlamentation, was inside the walls, in the city of rich Latinus.\rHere mothers and unhappy daughters-in-law, here the loving hearts\rof grieving sisters, and boys robbed of their fathers, cursed the dreadful\rwar, and the marriage Turnus had intended, and demanded that he \rand he alone should fight it out with armour and blade, he who \rclaimed for himself the kingdom of Italy, and the foremost honours.\rCruelly, Drances added to this and testified that Turnus alone\rwas summoned, that he alone was challenged to battle.\rAt the same time many an opinion in varied words was against it,\rand for Turnus, and the Queen\xc3\x95s noble name protected him,\rwhile his great fame, and the trophies he\xc3\x95d earned, spoke for him. \r\rBKXI:225-295 AN ANSWER FROM ARPI\r\rAmongst this stir, at the heart of the blaze of dissension,\rbehold, to crown it all, the ambassadors brought an answer\rfrom Diomedes\xc3\x95s great city, sad that nothing had been achieved\rat the cost of all their efforts, presents and gold \rand heartfelt prayers had been useless, the Latins must find\rother armies or seek peace with the Trojan king.\rKing Latinus sank beneath this vast disappointment.\rThe angry gods and the fresh graves before his eyes, had given\rwarning that this fateful Aeneas was clearly sent by divine will. \rSo, summoning his high council, the leaders of his people, \rby royal command, he gathered them within his tall gates.\rThey convened, streaming to the king\xc3\x95s palace, through\rthe crowded streets. Latinus, the oldest and most powerful,\rseated himself at their centre, with no pleasure in his aspect.\rAnd he ordered the ambassadors, back from the Aetolian city,\rto tell their news, asking for all the answers in order.\rThen all tongues fell silent, and, obeying \rhis order, Venulus began as follows:\r\xc3\x94O citizens, we have seen Diomedes and his Argive camp,\rcompleted our journey, overcome all dangers,\rand grasped that hand by which the land of Troy fell.\rAs victor over the Iapygian fields, by the Garganus hills, he was\rfounding the city of Argyripa, named after his father\xc3\x95s people.\rWhen we had entered, and were given leave to speak to him\rin person, we offered our gifts, and declared our name and country:\rwho had made war on us: and what had brought us to Arpi.\rHe listened and replied in this way with a calm look:\r\xc3\x92O fortunate nations, realms of Saturn, ancient peoples\rof Ausonia, what fortune troubles your peace\rand persuades you to invite base war?\rWe who violated the fields of Troy with our blades,\r(forgetting what we endured in battle beneath her high walls,\ror those warriors Simois drowned) have paid in atrocious suffering,\rand every kind of punishment, for our sins, throughout the world,\ra crew that even Priam would have pitied: Minerva\xc3\x95s dark star\rand that cliff of Euboea, Caphereus the avenger, know it. \rMenelaus, son of Atreus, driven from that warfare to distant shores,\rwas exiled as far as Egypt, and the Pillars of Proteus,\rwhile Ulysses has viewed the Cyclopes of Aetna.\rEven Mycenean Agamemnon, leader of the mighty Greeks,\rwas struck down at the hand of his wicked wife, when barely\rover the threshold: he conquered Asia, but an adulterer lurked.\rNeed I speak of the kingdom of Neoptolemus, Idomeneus\xc3\x95s\rhousehold overthrown, or the Locrians living on Libya\xc3\x95s coast?\rHow the gods begrudged me my return to my country\xc3\x95s \raltars: the wife I longed for: and lovely Calydon?\rEven now visitations pursue me, dreadful to see:\rmy lost comrades, as birds, sought the sky with their wings\ror haunt the streams (alas a dire punishment for my people!)\rand fill the cliffs with their mournful cries.\rThis was the fate I should have expected from that moment\rwhen, in madness, I attacked Venus\xc3\x95s heavenly body\rwith my sword, and harmed her hand by wounding it.\rDo not, in truth, do not urge me to such conflict. Since Troy\xc3\x95s \rtowers have fallen I have no quarrel with Teucer\xc3\x95s race,\rnor have I joyful memories of those ancient evils.\rTake the gifts your bring me, from your country,\rto Aeneas. I have withstood his cruel weapons and fought him\rhand to hand: trust my knowledge of how he looms\rtall above his shield, with what power he hurls his spear. \rHad the Troad produced two other men like him, \rthe Trojans would have reached the Greek cities,\rand Greece would be grieving, their fates reversed. \rDuring all that time we spent facing the walls of enduring Troy\ra Greek victory was stalled at the hands of Hector \rand Aeneas, and denied us till the tenth year.\rBoth were outstanding in courage and weaponry:\rAeneas was first in virtue. Join hands with him in confederation,\ras best you can, but beware of crossing swords with him.\xc3\x93\rNoblest of kings, you have heard, in one, what their king replies\rand what his counsels are concerning this great war.\xc3\x95\r\rBKXI:296-335 LATINUS\xc3\x95S PROPOSAL\r\rThe ambassadors had scarcely finished speaking when diverse \rmurmurs passed swiftly among the troubled Italian faces, just as\rwhen rocks detain a flowing river a muttering rises from the imprisoned\reddies, and the banks, that border it echo with splashing waves. \rAs soon as thoughts were calmer and anxious lips were quiet, the king\rbegan to speak, from his high throne, first calling on the gods:\r\xc3\x94Latins, I wish we had decided on this vital matter before now,\rand it would have been better not to convene the council at such\ra moment, when the enemy is settled in front of our walls. \rCitizens we are waging a wrong-headed war with a divine race,\runconquered warriors whom no battles weary, and who\rwill not relinquish the sword even when beaten.\rIf you had hopes of the alliance with Aetolian armies,\rforgo them. Each has his own hopes: but see how slight they are.\rAs for the rest of our affairs, the utter ruin they lie in\ris in front of your eyes and under your hands.\rI accuse no one: what the utmost courage could do has \rbeen done: the conflict has taken all the strength of our kingdom.\rSo let me explain the decision of my deliberating mind,\rand I will outline it briefly (apply your thoughts to it).\rThere\xc3\x95s an ancient domain of mine along the Tuscan river,\rstretching westward, to the Sicanian border and beyond:\rAuruncans and Rutulians work the stubborn hills with the plough,\rsow seed there, and use the roughest slopes as pasture. \rLet us yield all this region, with the pine-clad tract of high hills,\rto the Trojans in friendship, and spell out the just terms \rof a treaty, and invite them to share our kingdom:\rlet them settle, if their desire is such, and build their city.\rBut if their wish is to conquer other territories \rand some other nation, and they might leave our soil,\rlet us fashion twenty ships of Italian oak: or more if they\rcan fill them, all the timber lies close to the water:\rlet them set out the number and design of their fleet\rthemselves: we\xc3\x95ll give the labour, the shipyard and the bronze.\rMoreover, I want a hundred envoys to go to carry the news\rand seal the pact, Latins of noblest birth, holding out branches\ras peace tokens in their hands, and bearing gifts, talents\rof ivory and gold, and the throne and the robe, symbols of royalty.\rConsult together, and repair our weary fortunes.\xc3\x95\r\rBKXI:336-375 DRANCES ATTACKS TURNUS VERBALLY\r\rThen Drances, whom Turnus\xc3\x95s glory provoked with the bitter\rsting of secret envy, rose, hostile as before,: lavish \rof his wealth, and a better speaker, but with a hand \rfrozen in battle: held to be no mean adviser in council,\rand powerful in a quarrel (his mother\xc3\x95s high birth\rgranted him nobility, his father\xc3\x95s origin was uncertain):\rand with these words added weight and substance to their anger:\r\xc3\x94O gracious king, you consult us on a subject clear to all,\rand needing no speech from us: everyone acknowledges\rthey know what the public good demands, but shrink from speech.\rLet that man, through whose inauspicious leadership\rand perverse ways (speak I will though he threaten me \rwith violence or death) we have seen so many glorious leaders\rfall, and the city sunk in mourning, while he attacks the Trojan camp,\rtrusting in flight, and frightens heaven with his weapons, let him\rgrant freedom of speech, and cease his arrogance.\rAdd one further gift to the many you order us to send\rand communicate to the Trojans, one more, gracious king,\rwhy not, as a father may, and let no man\xc3\x95s violence prevent you,\rgive your daughter to an illustrious man in a marriage \rworthy of her, binding this peace with an everlasting contract.\rBut if fear of doing such possesses our minds and hearts,\rlet us appeal to the prince, and beg permission from him:\rto yield, and give up his rights in favour of his king and his country.\rO Turnus, you who are the source and reason for all these problems\rfor Latium, why do you so often hurl your wretched countrymen\rinto obvious danger? There\xc3\x95s no remedy in war, we all ask you\rfor peace, together with the sole inviolable pledge of peace.\rI first of all, whom you imagine to be your enemy (and I\rwill not contest it) come as a suppliant. Pity your people,\rset your pride aside, and conquered, give way. Routed,\rwe have seen enough of death and made broad acres desolate.\rOr, if glory stirs you, if you harbour such strength of feeling,\rand if a palace as dowry is so dear to you, be bold,\rand carry yourself confidently against the enemy.\rSurely we whose lives are worthless should be scattered\rover the fields, unburied and unwept, so that Turnus\rmight gain his royal bride? And you too, if you have\rany strength, if you have any of your father\xc3\x95s warlike spirit, \ryou must look into the face of your challenger.\xc3\x95\r\rBKXI:376-444 TURNUS REPLIES\r\rTurnus\xc3\x95s fury blazed at such a speech. He gasped\rand from the depths of his heart gave vent to these words:\r\xc3\x94Drances, it\xc3\x95s true you always have more than plenty to say \rwhenever war calls for men, and you\xc3\x95re first to appear when the senate \ris called together. But there\xc3\x95s no need to fill the council-house with words,\rthat fly so freely from you when you are safe, when the rampart walls\rkeep the enemy off  and the ditches are not yet drowned in blood.\rSo thunder away, eloquently (as is your wont) Drances, and charge\rme with cowardice when your hand has produced like mounds\rof Trojan dead, and dotted the fields everywhere \rwith trophies. You\xc3\x95re free to try what raw courage can do,\rand certainly we don\xc3\x95t need to search far for enemies:\rthey\xc3\x95re surrounding the walls on every side.\rShall we go against them? Why hesitate? \rWill your appetite for war always remain \rin your airy tongue and fleeing feet?\rI, beaten? You total disgrace, can anyone who sees \rthe Tiber swollen with Trojan blood, and all Evander\xc3\x95s \rhouse and race toppled, and the Arcadians stripped \rof weapons, say with justice I am beaten?\rBitias, and giant Pandarus, and the thousand men that I as victor\rsent down to Tartarus in one day, did not find it so, imprisoned \rthough I was by the walls, and hedged by enemy ramparts.\rNo safety in war? Madman, sing such about the Trojan\xc3\x95s life,\rand your possessions. Go on then, troubling everyone\rwith your great fears, and extolling the powers of a race\rtwice-defeated, while disparaging Latinus\xc3\x95s army.\rNow even Myrmidon princes, now Diomede, Tydeus\xc3\x95s \rson, and Larissean Achilles, tremble at Trojan weapons,\rand Aufidus\xc3\x95s river flows backwards from the Adriatic waves.\rAnd what when he pretends he\xc3\x95s afraid to quarrel with me,\rthe cunning rascal, and intensifies the charge with false terror.\rYou\xc3\x95ll not lose a life like yours to my right hand \r(don\xc3\x95t shrink) keep it, let it remain in your breast.\rNow, old father, I return to you and your great debate.\rIf you place no further hope in our forces,\rif we\xc3\x95re so desolate, if one reverse for our troops\rhas utterly destroyed us, and our Fortunes cannot return,\rlet\xc3\x95s stretch out our helpless hands, and sue for peace.\rOh if only our traditional courage was here, though.\rThat man to me would be happy in his efforts, and outstanding \rin spirit, who had fallen in death, so as not to see\rsuch things, and who had bitten the dust once and for all.\rYet if we still have our wealth and manhood intact\rand nations and cities of Italy are still our allies,\rif the Trojans won glory with great bloodshed,\r(they too have their dead, the storm of war\xc3\x95s the same for all)\rwhy do we lose heart, shamefully, on the very threshold?\rWhy does fear seize our limbs before the trumpets sound?\rMany things change for the better with time, and the various\rlabours of altering years: Fortune toys with many a man,\rthen, visiting him in turn, sets him on solid ground again.\rThe Aetolian and his Arpi will be no help to us:\rbut Messapus will, and Tolumnius, the fortunate,\rand all those leaders sent by many a people: no little glory\rwill accrue to the flower of Latium and Laurentine fields.\rWe have Camilla too, of the glorious Volscian nation,\rleading her troop of riders, and squadrons bright with bronze.\rBut if the Trojans only call me to fight, and that\xc3\x95s your wish,\rif I\xc3\x95m so great an obstacle to the common good, Victory is far\rfrom having fled these hands of mine with such hatred \rthat I should refuse to try anything for a hope so sweet.\rI\xc3\x95d face him with courage though he outclassed great Achilles,\rand wore armour to match, fashioned by Vulcan\xc3\x95s hands.\rI, Turnus, not second in virtue to any of my ancestors,\rdedicate my life to you all, and to Latinus, father of my bride,\rAeneas challenges me alone? I pray that he does so challenge:\rand, if the gods\xc3\x95 anger is in this, that it is not Drances rather than I\rwho appeases them in death, or if there\xc3\x95s worth and glory, takes it all. \r\rBKXI:445-531 THE TROJANS ATTACK\r\rArguing among themselves, they debated the issues \rin doubt: while Aeneas was moving his camp and lines.\rSee, a messenger runs through the royal palace,\rwith great commotion, filling the city with huge alarm:\rthe Trojans, ready for battle, and the Etruscan ranks\rwere sweeping down from the river Tiber, over the plain.\rAt once people\xc3\x95s minds were troubled, their hearts shaken,\rand their deep anger roused by the ungentle shock.\rAnxiously they called for weapons: weapons the young men\rshouted, while their sad fathers wept and murmured. \rAnd now a great clamour filled with discord rose to heaven \ron every side, as when a flock of birds settles by chance \rin some tall grove, or when the swans give their hoarse calls,\ramong noisy pools, by Padusa\xc3\x95s fish-filled streams.\r\xc3\x94Yes, oh citizens,\xc3\x95 Turnus cried, seizing his moment, \r\xc3\x94convene your council and sit there praising peace:\rwhile they attack us with weapons.\xc3\x95 He said no more\rbut sprang up and went swiftly from the high halls.\r\xc3\x94You, Volusus,\xc3\x95 he shouted, \xc3\x94tell the Volscian troops to arm, \rand lead the Rutulians. Messapus, and Coras with your brother, \rdeploy the cavalry, under arms, over the wide plain. \rLet some secure the city gates, and occupy the towers:\rthe rest carry their weapons with me, where I order.\xc3\x95\rAt once there was a rush to the walls all over the city.\rKing Latinus himself left the council, dismayed by the darkness\rof the hour, and abandoned his great plan, reproaching himself\ragain and again for not having freely received Trojan Aeneas,\rand adopted him as his son-in-law for the city\xc3\x95s sake.\rSome dug trenches in front of the gates or carried stones\rand stakes. The harsh trumpet gave the cruel call to war.\rThen a diverse circle of mothers and sons \rringed the walls: this final trial summoned them all.\rMoreover the Queen, with a great crowd of women, \rdrove to Pallas\xc3\x95s temple on the heights of the citadel\rcarrying gifts, virgin Lavinia next to her as her companion,\ra source of so much trouble, her beautiful eyes cast down.\rThe women climbed to the temple, filled it with incense \rfumes, and poured out sad prayers from the high threshold:\r\xc3\x94Tritonian Virgin, mighty in weapons, ruler of war, shatter\rthe spear of the Trojan robber, with your hand, hurl him flat\ron the earth, stretch him prone beneath our high gates.\xc3\x95\rTurnus, in a fury of zeal, armed himself for battle.\rHe was already dressed in his glowing breastplate, \rbristling with bronze scales, his legs sheathed in gold,\rhis temples still bare, his sword buckled to his side,\rshining, splendid, as he ran down from the citadel\xc3\x95s heights,\rexultant in spirit, already anticipating the enemy in hope:\rlike a stallion, breaking his tether and fleeing his stall,\rfree at last, lord of the open plain, who either heads\rfor the pastures and the herds of mares, or, used to bathing\rin some familiar river, gallops away, and, with head held high,\rneighs with pleasure, his mane playing over neck and shoulder.\rCamilla sped to meet him, accompanied by her Volscian \rtroops, and alighted from her horse close by the gates, \rall her company leaving their mounts at her example,\rand slipping to earth: then she spoke as follows:\r\xc3\x94Turnus, if the brave may rightly have faith in themselves,\rI dare to, and promise to, encounter Aeneas\xc3\x95s cavalry,\rand ride to meet the Etruscan horsemen alone.\rLet me attempt the first dangers of the battle with my hand\rwhile you stay by the walls and protect the ramparts.\xc3\x95\rTurnus replied, his gaze fixed on this amazing girl:\r\xc3\x94O virgin glory of Italy, how should I attempt \rto thank you or repay you? But as your spirit\rsoars beyond us all, share the task with me.\rAeneas, so rumour says, and scouts sent out confirm,\rhas deployed his light cavalry to search the plains\rthoroughly: he himself climbing the ridge, marches\rthrough the desolate heights towards the town.\rI am preparing an ambush on a deep track in the woods,\rso as to block both entrances to the gorge with armed men:\ryou must wait for the Etruscan cavalry charge:\rbrave Messapus will be with you, and the Latin troops,\rand Tiburtus\xc3\x95s band, and you must take command as leader.\xc3\x95\rSo he spoke, and exhorted Messapus and all the allied generals\rto battle, with similar words, then moved against the enemy.\rThere\xc3\x95s a valley with a winding bend, suitable for the tricks\rand stratagems of warfare, crowded on both sides \rby a dark wall of dense leaves, to which a narrow track\rleads: it has a confined floor, and a difficult entrance.\rAbove it, among the look-outs of the high mountain tops,\rlies a hidden level and a secure shelter,\rwhether one wishes to attack to right or left,\ror make a stand on the ridge and roll huge boulders down.\rHere the warrior hurried by a well known network of paths\rand taking position he occupied the treacherous woods.\r\rBKXI:532-596 DIANA\xc3\x95S CONCERN FOR CAMILLA\r\rMeanwhile, in heaven\xc3\x95s halls, Diana, Latona\xc3\x95s daughter,\rspoke to swift Opis, one of her sacred band of virgin \rfollowers, and gave voice to these sorrowful words:\r\xc3\x94O girl, Camilla, is going to the cruel war, and takes up\r my weapons in vain. She\xc3\x95s dearer to me than all others, \rand this is no new love that comes to Diana, \ror moves my spirit with sudden sweetness.\rWhen Metabus was driven from his throne by hatred\rof his tyrannical power, and was leaving Privernum,\rhis ancient city, fleeing amidst the conflict of war,\rhe took his child to share his exile, and, slightly altering\rher mother\xc3\x95s name Casmilla, called her Camilla.\rCarrying her in front of him at his breast he sought a long ridge\rof lonely forests: fierce weapons threatened him on every side, \rand the Volscians hovered round him with their troops.\rWhile they were still in mid-flight, see, the Ausenus overflowed,\rfoaming to the top of its banks, so great a downpour burst \rfrom the clouds. He, preparing to swim across, was held back\rby love of his child, and fear for his dear burden. Quickly,\rdebating all options with himself, he settled reluctantly\ron this idea: the warrior fastened his daughter to the giant spear,\rsolid with knots and of seasoned oak, he chanced to be carrying\rin his strong hand, wrapping her in the bark of a cork-tree\rfrom the woods, and tying her wisely to the middle of the shaft:\rthen balancing it in his mighty hand he cried out to the heavens:\r\xc3\x94Kind virgin daughter of Latona, dweller in the woods, I her father\rdedicate this child to your service: fleeing the enemy through the air,\ryours is the first weapon she clasps as a suppliant. Goddess I beg you\rto accept as your own this that I now commit to the uncertain breeze.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke, and drawing back his arm hurled the spinning shaft:\rthe waters roared, and the wretched Camilla flew \rover the rushing river on the hissing steel. And Metabus, \rwith a great crowd of his enemies pressing him closely, \rgave himself to the flood, and victoriously snatched his gift\rto Diana from the grassy turf, the spear and the little maid.\rNo city would accept him within their houses or their walls,\r(nor would he in his savagery have given himself up to them)\rhe passed his life among shepherds on the lonely mountains.\rHere, among the thickets of savage lairs, he nourished \rhis child at the udders of a mare from the herd, and milk \rfrom wild creatures, squeezing the teats into her delicate mouth.\rAs soon as the infant had taken her first steps, \rhe placed a sharp lance in her hands, and hung \rbow and quiver from the little one\xc3\x95s shoulder.\rA tiger\xc3\x95s pelt hung over head and down her back\rinstead of a gold clasp for her hair, and a long trailing robe.\rEven then she was hurling childish spears with tender hand,\rwhirling a smooth-thonged sling round her head,\rbringing down Strymonian cranes and snowy swans.\rMany a mother in Etruscan fortresses wished for her\ras a daughter-in-law in vain: she, pure, content with Diana\ralone, cherished her love of her weapons and maidenhood.\rI wish she had not been swept up into such warfare, \rtrying to challenge the Trojans: she would be \rmy darling, and one of my company still.\rCome now, nymph, since bitter fate drives her on,\rslip from the sky and seek out the Latin borders,\rwhere with evil omen they join in sad battle.\rTake these weapons and draw an avenging arrow from the quiver, \rand if anyone violates her sacred flesh by wounding her, \rTrojan or Italian, pay me with their equal punishment in blood. \rThen I\xc3\x95ll carry the body and untouched weapons of the poor girl\rin a cavernous cloud to a sepulchre, and bury her in her own land.\xc3\x95\rShe spoke, and Opis slid down with a sound through \rheaven\xc3\x95s light air, her body veiled in a dark whirlwind.\r\r\r\rBKXI:597-647 THE ARMIES ENGAGE\r\rIn the meantime the Trojan band with the Etruscan\rleaders, and all the cavalry, approached the walls,\rmarshalled in squadrons troop by troop. Warhorses\rneighing, cavorted over the whole area, fighting the tight rein,\rprancing this way and that: the field bristled far and wide\rwith the steel of spears, and the plain blazed with lifted weapons.\rOn the other side, also, Messapus, and the swift Latins, \rCoras with his brother, and virgin Camilla\xc3\x95s wing appeared,\ropposing them on the plain, and drawing their right arms far back\rthey thrust their lances forward, the spear-points quivered:\rthe march of men and the neighing of horses increased.\rAnd now both halted their advance within a spear\xc3\x95s throw:\rthey ran forward with a sudden shout and spurred on \rtheir maddened horses, spears showered from all sides at once\ras dense as snowflakes, and the sky was veiled in darkness.\rImmediately Tyrrhenus and brave Aconteus charged \reach other, with levelled spears, and were the first to fall\rwith a mighty crash, shattering their horses\xc3\x95 breastbones\ras they collided: Aconteus, hurled like a thunderbolt\ror a heavy stone shot from a catapult, was thrown \rsome distance, and wasted his breath of life on the air.\rAt once the ranks wavered, and the Latins slung their shields\rbehind them, and turned their mounts towards the walls.\rThe Trojans pursued, Asilas their leader heading the squadrons.\rNow they were nearing the gates when the Latins again\rraised a shout, and turned their horse\xc3\x95s responsive necks:\rthe Trojans now fled, and retreated to a distance with loose reins,\rlike the sea running in with alternate waves, \rnow rushing to shore, dashing over the rocks \rin a foaming flood, drenching the furthest sands \rwith its swell, now retreating quickly, sucking rolling\rpebbles in its wash, leaving dry sand as the shallows ebbed:\rtwice the Tuscans drove the routed Rutulians to the city, twice,\rrepulsed, they looked behind, defending their backs with their shields.\rBut when they clashed in a third encounter their lines \r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe Servants of Aeneas Battling the Servants of the Latin King Giovanni Battista Fontana (Italy, 1524-1587)\rLACMA Collections\r\r\n\rlocked tight, and man marked man, then truly, the battle\rswelled fiercely among the groans of the dying, \rwith weapons, bodies, and horses in their death-throes, \rin pools of blood, entangled with slaughtered riders.\rOrsilochus hurled a lance at Remulus\xc3\x95s horse, fearing\rto attack the man, and left the point embedded beneath its ear:\rThe rearing charger, maddened by the blow, and unable to bear\rthe wound, lifted its chest, and thrashed high with its forelegs,\rRemulus thrown clear, rolled on the ground. Catillus\rfelled Iollas and Herminius, a giant in courage, a giant \rin torso and limbs, tawny hair on his head, his shoulders bare,\rfor whom wounds held no terror he spread so wide in his armour. \rThe driven spear passed quivering through his broad shoulders,\rand, piercing him, doubled him up with pain. Dark blood \rstreamed everywhere: clashing with swords, they dealt death \rand sought a glorious ending through their wounds.\r\rBKXI:648-724 CAMILLA IN ACTION\r\rBut an Amazon exulted in the midst of the slaughter, \rwith one breast bared for battle: Camilla, armed with her quiver:\rnow she showered sturdy javelins, scattering them from her hands,\rnow she lifted a strong battle-axe in her unwearied grasp:\rand Diana\xc3\x95s weapon, a golden bow, rattled on her shoulder.\rEven when she retreated, attacked from behind,\rshe reversed her bow and fired arrows while fleeing.\rAnd around her were chosen comrades, virgin Larina,\rand Tulla, and Tarpeia wielding her axe of bronze,\rthe Italides, daughters of Italy, whom noble Camilla \rchose herself as her glory, faithful servants in peace or war:\rsuch were the Amazons of Thrace, treading Thermodon\xc3\x95s \rstreams, and fighting with ornate weapons, around \rHippolyte, or when Penthesilea returned, in her chariot,\rand the ranks of women with crescent shields exulted.\rWhom did you strike, first and last, with your spear, fierce girl?\rHow many bodies did you spill over the earth?\rEuneus, son of Clytius, was the first, whose exposed chest\r\r\r\r\r\r\rCamillia at War, Giacomo del Po (Italy, 1652-1726)\rLACMA Collections\r\r\n\rshe pierced with her long shaft of pine, as he faced her.\rHe fell, spewing streams of blood, and bit\rthe gory dust, and, dying, writhed on his wound.\rThen she killed Liris and Pagasus too, one gathering\rthe reins of his wounded horse as he rolled from it, the other \rnearing to stretch out a defenceless hand to the falling man,\rboth flung headlong together. She added to them Amastrus, \rson of Hippotas, and, leaning forward to throw, sent her spear \rafter Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon and Cromis:\rand as many spears as the girl sent spinning from her hand, \rso many Trojan warriors fell. The huntsman Ornytus\rwas riding far off, in unfamiliar armour, on his Iapygian\rhorse, the hide stripped from a bullock covering his broad\rshoulders, his head protected by a wolf\xc3\x95s huge gaping mask,\rand white-toothed jaws, a rustic\xc3\x95s hunting-spear in his hand:\rhe moved along in the centre of the army, a full head \rabove the rest. Catching him she struck him (no effort\rin the routed ranks) then with pitiless heart spoke above him:\r\xc3\x94Did you think you chased prey in the forest, Tuscan?\rThe day is here that proves your words wrong, with\ra woman\xc3\x95s weapons. But you\xc3\x95ll carry no small fame\rto your father\xc3\x95s shades, you fell to Camilla\xc3\x95s spear.\xc3\x95\rThen she killed Orsilochus and Butes, two of the largest Trojans,\rButes she fixed with a spear in the back, between \rbreastplate and helmet, where the rider\xc3\x95s neck \rgleams and the shield hangs from the left arm:\rwhile fleeing from Orsilochus, chased in a wide circle, \rshe eluded him, wheeling inside, pursuing the pursuer:\rthen, lifting herself higher, drove her strong axe, again and again,\rthrough armour and bone, as he begged and prayed desperately:\rthe wounds staining his face with warm brain-matter.\rNow the warrior son of Aunus, met her, and suddenly\rhalted, terrified at the sight, he a man of the Apennines,\rnot the least of the lying Ligurians while fate allowed it.\rWhen he saw he couldn\xc3\x95t escape a fight by a turn of speed,\ror divert the queen from her attack, he tried to devise\ra stratagem with wit and cunning, as follows:\r\xc3\x94What\xc3\x95s so great about relying on a strong horse, woman?\rForget flight, and trust yourself to fighting me \ron level ground, equip yourself to battle on foot:\ryou\xc3\x95ll soon know whose windy boasting\xc3\x95s an illusion.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke, and she, raging and burning with bitter resentment,\rhanded her horse to a friend, and faced him with equal weapons.\ron foot and unafraid, with naked sword and plain shield.\rBut the youth, sure he had won by guile, sped off \r(instantly), flicking his reins, took to flight, \rpricking his horse to a gallop with spurs of steel.\rThe girl shouted: \xc3\x94Stupid Ligurian, uselessly vaunting\ryour boastful spirit, you\xc3\x95ve tried your slippery native wiles\rin vain, and cunning won\xc3\x95t carry you back to Aunus unharmed.\xc3\x95\rAnd like lightening she intercepted the horse\xc3\x95s path, on swift feet,\rand seizing the reins from in front tackled him, and took vengeance\ron the blood she hated: as light as a falcon, Apollo\xc3\x95s sacred bird, \rswooping from a tall rock, overtaking a dove in flight in the high cloud,\rholding her in its talons, and tearing her heart out with its curved talons:\rwhile blood and torn feathers shower from the sky.\r\rBKXI:725-767 ARRUNS FOLLOWS HER\r\rBut the father of gods and men with watchful eyes\rsat throned on high Olympus observing it all.\rThe maker stirred the Etruscan, Tarchon, to fierce battle\rand goaded him to anger with no gentle spur.\rSo Tarchon rode amidst the slaughter and the wavering ranks,\rinciting his squadrons with varied shouts, and calling \reach man by name, rallying the routed to the fight.\r\xc3\x94What fear, what utter cowardice has filled your hearts,\rO, you ever-sluggish Tuscans, O you who are never ashamed?\rCan a woman drive you in disorder and turn your ranks?\rWhy do we bear swords and spears idle in our right hands?\rBut you are not slow to love or for nocturnal battles, nor when \rthe curved pipe proclaims the Bacchic dance. Wait then for the feast \rand wine-cups on the loaded tables, (that is your passion \rand your pleasure) while the happy seer reports the sacred\romens, and the rich sacrifice calls you into the deep grove!\xc3\x95\rSo saying, and ready to die, he spurred his mount into the press,\rtore at Venulus like a whirlwind, and snatched him from his horse, \rand, clasping his enemy to his chest with his right arm,\rand stirring himself to a mighty effort, carried him off.\rA shout rose to the skies and all the Latins turned their gaze\rthat way. Tarchon flew over the plain like lightning, \rcarrying weapons and man: then he broke of the iron tip \rof his enemy\xc3\x95s spear, and searched for an unguarded opening\rwhere he might deal a deadly wound: Venulus, struggling with him,\rkept the hand from his throat, meeting force with force.\rAs when a tawny eagle soaring high carries a snake it has caught,\rentwined in its feet, with talons clinging, while the wounded serpent \rwrithes in sinuous coils, and rears its bristling scales, hissing\rwith its mouth as it rises up, and none the less attacks \rits struggling prey, with curved beak, while its wings beat the air:\rso Tarchon carried his prize in triumph from the Tiburtian ranks.\rEmulating their leader\xc3\x95s example and success, the Etruscans charged.\rAnd now Arruns, a man whose life was owed to the fates,\rbegan to circle swift Camilla, with his javelin, \rwith skilful cunning, trying for the easiest of chances.\rWherever the girl rode among the ranks, in her fury,\rthere Arruns shadowed her, and followed her track in silence:\rwherever she returned in triumph or withdrew from the foe,\rthere the youth secretly turned his quick reins.\rHe tried this approach and that, travelling the whole circuit\ron every side, relentlessly brandishing his sure spear. \r\rBKXI:768-835 THE DEATH OF CAMILLA\r\rIt chanced that Chloreus, once a priest, sacred to Cybele,\rglittered some distance away splendid in Phrygian armour,\rspurring his foam-flecked horse, that a hide, plumed \rwith bronze scales, and clasped with gold, protected.\rHe himself, shining with deep colours and foreign purple,\rfired Gortynian arrows from a Lycian bow:\rthe weapon was golden on his shoulder, and golden\rthe seer\xc3\x95s helm: his saffron cloak and its rustling folds of linen\rwere gathered into a knot with yellow gold, his tunic\rand barbaric leg-coverings embroidered by the needle.\rThe virgin huntress singling him out from all the press \rof battle, either hoping to hang his Trojan weapons \rin the temple, or to display herself in captured gold, \rpursued him blindly, and raged recklessly through the ranks,\rwith a feminine desire for prizes and spoil, \rwhen Arruns, finally seizing his chance, raised his spear\rfrom ambush and prayed aloud, like this, to heaven:\r\xc3\x94Highest of gods, Apollo, guardian of holy Soracte,\rwhose chief followers are we for whom the blaze of the pine-wood \rfire is fed, and who as worshippers, confident in our faith,\rplant our steps on deep embers among the flames, \rall-powerful father grant that this shame be effaced \rby our weapons. I seek no prize, no trophy of the girl\xc3\x95s defeat,\rno spoils: some other deed will bring me fame: \ronly let this dreadful scourge fall wounded under my blow,\rand I\xc3\x95ll return without glory to the cities of my ancestors.\xc3\x95\rPhoebus heard him, and granted the success of half the prayer\rin his mind, half he scattered on the passing breeze: he agreed\rto the prayer that Arruns might bring Camilla to sudden death\xc3\x95s ruin:\rbut did not grant that his noble country should see him return, \rand the gusts carried his words away on the southerly winds.\rSo as the spear whistled through the air, speeding from his hand,\rall the Volscians turned their eager eyes and minds \rtowards the queen. She herself noticed neither breeze\rnor sound, nor the weapon falling from the sky, \rtill the spear went home, fixing itself under her naked\rbreast, and driven deep, drank of her virgin blood.\rHer friends rushed to her anxiously and caught \rtheir falling queen. Arruns, more fearful than the rest,\rfled in joy and terror, not daring to trust \rhis spear further, or meet the virgin\xc3\x95s weapons. \rAnd as a wolf that has killed a shepherd, or a great bullock,\rimmediately hides itself deep in the pathless mountains\rbefore the hostile spears can reach it, conscious\rof its audacious actions, and holds its lowered tail\rquivering between its legs, as it heads for the woods:\rso Arruns, in turmoil, stole away from sight,\rand, content to escape, plunged into the midst of the army.\rCamilla tugged at the weapon with dying hands, \rbut the iron point was fixed between the bones,\rnear the ribs, deep in the wound. She sank back\rbloodless, her eyes sank, chill with death,\rthe once radiant colour had left her cheeks.\rThen, expiring, she spoke to Acca, one of her peers, faithful\rto Camilla beyond all others, sole sharer of her sorrows, \rand uttered these words to her: \xc3\x94Acca, my sister, \rmy strength lasted this far: now the bitter wound \rexhausts me, and all around me darkens with shadows.\rFly, and carry my final commands to Turnus: he must take\rmy place in the battle, and keep the Trojans from the city.\rNow farewell.\xc3\x95 With these words she let go the reins, slipping \rhelplessly to earth. Then, little by little, growing cold she loosed \rherself from her body completely, dipping the unresponsive neck\rand that head death had seized, letting go her weapons, \rand with a sob her life fled angrily to the shades below.\rThen indeed an immense shout rose, reaching \rthe golden stars: with Camilla fallen, the battle swelled:\rthe Trojan host, the Etruscan leaders, and Evander\xc3\x95s\rArcadian squadrons rushed on in a mass together.\r\rBKXI:836-915 OPIS TAKES REVENGE\r\rNow Opis, Diana\xc3\x95s sentinel, had been seated there \ron a mountain, for a long time, watching the battle fearlessly.\rAnd when she saw far off, amongst the clamour of raging armies,\rthat Camilla had paid the penalty of death, she sighed\rand uttered these words from the depths of her heart:\r\xc3\x94Ah too cruel, virgin girl, too cruel the sacrifice \ryou have made, for trying to challenge the Trojans in war!\rIt has not helped you that you worshipped Diana \rin the lonely woods and wore our quiver on your shoulder.\rYet your queen has not left you without honour now \rin the extremes of death, nor will your loss be without fame\ramong the people, nor will you suffer the infamy of dying \run-avenged. For whoever desecrated your body with this wound\rwill pay the price of death.\xc3\x95 An earthen mound, covered \rwith shadowy holm-oak, stood beneath the high mountain, \rthe vast tomb of Dercennus, an ancient Laurentine king:\rhere the loveliest of goddesses, after swift flight, first set foot\rand caught sight of Arruns from the high tumulus.\rWhen she saw him shining in armour, swollen with pride,\rshe cried: \xc3\x94Why go so far away? Turn your steps here,\rcome this way to destruction, and receive your reward,\rworthy of Camilla. May even you not die by Diana\xc3\x95s weapons?\xc3\x95\rShe spoke: then the Thracian goddess took a winged arrow\rfrom her golden quiver, and stretched the bow in anger,\rdrawing it far back, until the curving horns met, \rand now with levelled arms she touched the steel tip\rwith her left hand, and her breast and the bow-string with her right.\rAt the same moment as Arruns heard the hissing dart,\rand the rushing air, both one, the steel was fixed in his body.\rHis allies, oblivious, left him on the unmemorable dust\rof the plain, gasping and groaning in extremity:\rwhile Opis winged her way to heavenly Olympus.\rCamilla\xc3\x95s light cavalry were first to flee, their mistress lost,\rthe Rutulians fled in turmoil, brave Atinas fled,\rscattered leaders and abandoned troops sought safety,\rand, wheeling their horses about, headed for the walls.\rNo one could check the pursuing, death-dealing \rTrojans with weapons, or stand against them \rbut slung their unstrung bows on bowed shoulders,\rand their horses\xc3\x95 hooves shook the crumbling earth in flight. \rA cloud of dark murky dust rolled towards the walls,\rand mothers, from the watchtowers, raised the womens\xc3\x95 \rcry to the stars in heaven, as they beat their breasts.\rThe enemy host pressed hard on those who first broke at speed \rthrough the open gates, mixing with their lines, so they did not\rescape a pitiful death, but, pierced through, gasped away their lives\ron the very threshold, their country\xc3\x95s walls around them, within \rthe shelter of their houses. Some closed the gates, and dared not\ropen a path for their friends or let them inside the walls, \rthough they begged, and the most pitiful death followed, of those \rdefending the entrance in arms, and those rushing onto the swords.\rSome driven by the rout, shut out, in front of the gaze \rand the weeping faces of their parents, rolled headlong \rinto the ditches, others charging blindly with loose reins \rbattered at the gates and the tough gate-posts barring their way.\rThe women themselves when they saw Camilla from the walls\rin fierce emulation (true love of country guided them)\rthrew weapons with their weak hands, and in their haste\rused poles of tough oak and fire-hardened stakes instead of steel,\rand were ablaze to die in the forefront defending the walls.\rMeanwhile in the forest, the bitterest of messages filled Turnus\xc3\x95s \rthoughts: Acca had brought the warrior her news of the mighty rout:\rthe Volscian ranks annihilated, Camilla killed, the enemy\radvancing fiercely, sweeping all before them \rin the fortune of war, panic now reaching the city.\rMaddened he abandoned the ambush among the hills\r(so Jove\xc3\x95s cruel will demanded) and left the wild forest.\rHe had scarcely passed from view, in reaching the plain,\rwhen Aeneas, the leader, mounted the ridge, after entering\rthe unguarded gorge, and emerging from the dense woods.\rSo they both marched quickly towards the walls, \rin full force, and with no great distance between them:\rand at that moment Aeneas saw the plain, far off,\rsmoking with dust, and caught sight of the Laurentine army,\rand Turnus realised that fatal Aeneas was in arms,\rand heard the march of feet, and the sound of horses.\rThey would have joined battle at once and attempted combat,\rbut rosy Phoebus was already bathing his weary team\rin the Spanish deeps, and, day waning, brought back the night.\rThey camped before the city, and strengthened their defences.\r\r\n\r\rBOOK XII\r\r\rBKXII:1-53 TURNUS DEMANDS MARRIAGE\r\rWhen Turnus saw the Latins exhausted, and weakened\rby their military reverse, himself the subject of every gaze, his own\rpromise to them yet unfulfilled, he burned implacably,\rand unprompted, and raised his courage. As a lion, in the African\rbush, severely hurt by huntsmen with a wound to the chest, \ronly then rouses himself to battle, tosses his shaggy mane \rover his neck, in joy, and, unafraid, snaps off the spear \rsome poacher has planted in him, roaring from blood-stained jaws:\rso the violence grew in Turnus\xc3\x95s inflamed heart.\rThen he spoke to the king, beginning turbulently like this:\r\xc3\x94There\xc3\x95s no reluctance here, in Turnus: there\xc3\x95s no reason\rfor Aeneas\xc3\x95s coward crew to take back their words\ror renounce their pact: I go to meet him. Carry out \rthe holy rite, father, and draw up the marriage contract. \rI\xc3\x95ll either send this Trojan, this Asian deserter, \rto Tartarus, (let the Latins sit and watch) and \rwith my sword, alone, dispel the nation\xc3\x95s shame,\ror let him possess the defeated, let Lavinia go then as his bride.\xc3\x95\rLatinus replied to him with calm in his heart:\r\xc3\x94O youth of noble spirit, the more you excel\rin fierce courage, the more it is right for me to take\rcareful thought, and weigh every event with caution.\rYou have your father Daunus\xc3\x95s kingdom, you have\rthe many fortresses you captured by force, \rand Latinus is not short of gold and generosity:\rthere are other unmarried girls, not ignoble in birth, \rin the fields of Latium and Laurentium. Allow me to say this, \run-gently, openly stripped of all guile, and take it to heart:\rit was forbidden for me to ally my daughter to any\rof her former suitors, and all gods and men decreed it.\rConquered by love for you, conquered by kinship, and the tears\rof a sorrowful wife, I broke all bounds: I snatched the betrothed \rgirl from my son-in-law to be, and drew the impious sword.\rYou see, Turnus, what events, what war dogs me,\rwhat a heavy burden you above all bear.\rDefeated in two great battles we can hardly preserve\rthe hopes of Italy in our city: Tiber\xc3\x95s streams are yet warm\rwith our blood, the vast plains whitened by our bones.\rWhy did I waver so often? What madness changed my decision?\rIf I\xc3\x95d be ready to accept the Trojans as allies with Turnus \rdead, why not rather end the conflict while he\xc3\x95s alive?\rWhat would your Rutulian kin say, and the rest of Italy, \rif I betrayed you to death (let chance deny those words!)\rwhile seeking my daughter in marriage?\rConsider the fortunes of war: pity your aged father,\rwhom his native Ardea keeps apart from us, sorrowing.\xc3\x95\rTurnus\xc3\x95s fury was unaffected by these words:\rit mounted higher, inflamed by the treatment.\rAs soon as he was able to speak, he began like this:\r\xc3\x94Most gracious one, that concern you feel for me, I beg you,\rfor me, set it aside, and allow me to barter death for glory.\rI too can scatter spears and no lack of steel, from my hand, \rfather, and blood flows from the wounds I make as well.\rHis goddess mother will be far from him, she who covers\rhis flight with mist, like a woman, and hides in empty shadows.\xc3\x95\r\rBKXII:54-80 HE PROPOSES SINGLE COMBAT\r\rBut the queen wept, terrified by the new terms of conflict,\rand clung to her ardent son, as if she were dying:\r\xc3\x94Turnus, one thing I beg of you, by these tears, by any respect\rfor Amata that touches your heart: you are my only hope,\rthe peace of my sad old age, the honour and power of Latinus\ris in your hands, our whole tottering house rests on you:\rdo not engage in combat with the Trojans.\rWhatever danger awaits you in that battle awaits me too,\rTurnus: I would leave this hateful light with you\rand will never, as a prisoner, see Aeneas as my son-in-law.\xc3\x95\rLavinia listened to her mother\xc3\x95s words, her burning \rcheeks wet with tears, while a deep blush kindled \rtheir fire, and spread over her glowing face.\rHer virgin looks showed such colour as when one\rstains Indian ivory with crimson dye, or as\rwhite lilies redden when mixed with many a rose.\rLove stirred Turnus, and he fixed his gaze on the girl:\rfired still more for battle, he spoke briefly to Amata:\r\xc3\x94O mother, I beg you not to send me off with tears,\ror like ill omens, as I leave for the battles of a bitter war:\rTurnus is not free to delay his hour of death.\rIdmon, as a messenger, carry my unwelcome words \rto the Trojan leader. When tomorrow\xc3\x95s Dawn, riding\rher crimson chariot, reddens in the sky, do not lead\rTrojans against Rutulians, let Trojan and Rutulian\rweapons rest: let us resolve this war with our own blood,\ron that field let Lavinia be sought as bride.\xc3\x95\r\rBKXII:81-112 HE PREPARES FOR BATTLE\r\rWhen he had spoken, and returned quickly to the palace, he called \rfor his horses, and delighted in seeing them, neighing before him,\rhorses Orithyia herself gave Pilumnus, as a glory,\rsurpassing the snow in whiteness, and the wind for speed.\rTheir charioteers stood around eagerly patting their echoing chests,\rwith the flat of their hands, and combing their flowing manes.\rTurnus drew a breastplate, stiff with gold and pale bronze,\rover his shoulders, fitted his sword and shield in position,\rand the horns with their crimson crest: the god with the power\rof fire had wrought the sword for his father, Daunus, \rand dipped it, glowing, in the waters of the Styx.\rThen Turnus gripped his strong spear firmly, that stood \rleaning on a great column in the middle of the hall,\ra spoil won from the Auruncan, Actor, shook it till it quivered\rand shouted: \xc3\x94Now, o spear that never failed my call,\rnow the time has come: Actor, the mightiest, carried you,\rand now the right hand of Turnus: allow me to lay low \rthe body of that Phrygian eunuch, tear off and shatter \rhis breastplate with my powerful hand, and defile his hair \rwith dust, that\xc3\x95s curled with a heated iron, and drowned in myrrh.\xc3\x95\rHe was driven by frenzy, glowing sparks shot \rfrom his whole aspect, fire flashed from his fierce eyes, \rlike a bull, before a fight, that starts its formidable \rbellowing and, trying its anger with its horns, \rcharges a tree-trunk, lashes the air with its blows,\rand scatters the sand, as it practises for the battle.\rMeanwhile Aeneas, no less fierce, armed with the weapons,\rhis mother\xc3\x95s gift, sharpened himself for conflict, and roused \rhis anger, happy the war might be settled by the means on offer.\rThen he comforted his friends, and Iulus\xc3\x95s anxious fears,\rspeaking of destiny, and ordered them to take a firm reply\rto King Latinus, and declare his conditions for peace.\r\rBKXII:113-160 JUNO SPEAKS TO JUTURNA\r\rThe next dawn had scarcely begun to sprinkle the mountain\rsummits with its rays, at that time when the horses of the sun \rfirst rise from the deep ocean, and breathe light from lifted nostrils:\rthe Rutulians and Trojans had measured out the field \rof combat, under the massive walls of the city, \rand were preparing hearths and turf altars for their mutual gods.\rOthers wearing priest\xc3\x95s aprons, their foreheads wreathed \rwith vervain, brought spring water and fiery embers.\rThe Ausonian army marched out, and their ranks, armed \rwith spears, poured through the crowded gates. All the host\rof Trojans and Tuscans streamed out on the other side, arrayed \rin their various armour, equipped with steel, as if the bitter conflict\rof war called out to them. And the captains too, among their many\rthousands, darted about, brilliant in gold and purple,\rMnestheus of Assaracus\xc3\x95s line, brave Asilas,\rand Messapus, tamer of horses, son of Neptune.\rAs soon as each had retired to their own ground, at the given signal,\rthey planted their spears in the earth, and leant their shields on them.\rThen women, and weak old men, and the unarmed crowd, \rpoured out eagerly, and gathered on towers \rand rooftops, or stood on the summit of the gates.\rBut Juno, gazed at the plain, looking from the top of a hill\r(called Alban now, then without name, honour or glory)\rat the twin ranks of Laurentum and Troy, and Latinus\xc3\x95s city.\rImmediately, goddess to goddess, she spoke to Turnus\xc3\x95s sister, \rwho ruled over lakes and echoing rivers (Jupiter, the king\rof high heaven, gave her that honour for stealing her virginity):\r\xc3\x94Nymph, glory of rivers, dearest of all to my heart,\ryou know how I\xc3\x95ve preferred you alone of all the Latin girls\rwho\xc3\x95ve mounted unwelcome to the couch of great-hearted Jove,\rand I have freely granted you a place in a part of the sky:\rlest you blame me, Juturna, learn of impending grief.\rWhenever Fortune allowed, and the Fates permitted\rthe Latin state to prosper, I protected Turnus and your city.\rNow I see a warrior meeting with an unequal destiny,\rand a day of Fate and inimical force draws near.\rI cannot look at this combat, they agreed to, with my eyes.\rIf you dare do anything more for your brother in person, \rgo on: it\xc3\x95s fitting. Perhaps better things will follow for the wretched.\xc3\x95\rShe had scarcely spoken, when Juturna\xc3\x95s eyes flowed with tears,\rand her hand struck her lovely breast three or four times.\r\xc3\x94This is not the moment for tears,\xc3\x95 said Saturnian Juno:\r\xc3\x94Run, and, if there\xc3\x95s a way, snatch your brother from death:\ror stir conflict and shatter the treaty they\xc3\x95ve made.\rI teach you daring.\xc3\x95 Having urged her thus, she left her\runcertain and troubled, sadly hurt at heart.\r\rBKXII:161-215 AENEAS AND LATINUS SACRIFICE\r\rMeanwhile the kings drove out: Latinus in a four-horsed chariot\rof massive size (twelve golden rays circling his shining brow,\remblems of his ancestor, the Sun), Turnus behind a snow-white\rteam, brandishing two spears with broad steel blades in his hand.\rOn the other side, Aeneas, the leader, ancestor of the Roman race,\rcame from the camp, ablaze with starry shield and heavenly\rarmour, Ascanius with him, Rome\xc3\x95s second great hope, \rwhile a priest in pure robes brought the offspring \rof a bristly boar, and also an unshorn two-year sheep,\rand tethered the animals next to the blazing altars.\rThe heroes turned their gaze towards the rising sun, sprinkled \rsalt meal with their hands, marked the victims\xc3\x95 foreheads\rwith a knife, and poured libations from cups onto the altars.\rThen pious Aeneas, with sword drawn, prayed like this:\r\xc3\x94Sun, be my witness, and this country that I call on,\rfor which I have been able to endure such labours,\rand the all-powerful Father, and you Juno, his wife,\r(now goddess, now, be kinder, I pray) and you, glorious Mars,\ryou, father, who control all warfare with your will:\rI call on founts and rivers, on all the holiness \rof high heaven, and the powers in the blue ocean:\rif by chance Victory falls to Turnus of Italy,\rit is agreed the defeated will withdraw to Evander\xc3\x95s city,\rIulus will leave the land, and the people of Aeneas will never\rbring renewed war in battle, or attack this realm with the sword.\rBut if victory agrees that our contest is mine (as I think \rmore likely, and may the gods by their will prove it so),\rI will not command the Italians to submit to Trojans nor do I\rseek a kingdom for myself: let both nations, undefeated, \rput in place an eternal treaty. I will permit your gods \rand their rites: Latinus my father-in-law will keep his weapons,\rmy father-in-law will keep his accustomed power: the Trojans\rwill build walls for me, and Lavinia will give her name to a city.\rSo Aeneas was first to speak, then Latinus followed him, thus,\rraising his eyes to heaven, and stretching his right hand to the sky:\r\xc3\x94I also swear, Aeneas, by the same earth, sea, and sky, \rby Latona\xc3\x95s twin offspring, and by two-faced Janus, \rby the power of the gods below, and the shrines of cruel Dis: \rmay the Father, who ratifies treaties with his lightning, hear me.\rI touch the altar: I call as witness the gods, and the flames \rbetween us, no day shall break this peace or truce on Italy\xc3\x95s side,\rhowever things may fall out: nor will any power\rdeflect my will, not if it plunges the earth, drowned \rin flood, into the waves, and dissolves heaven in hell,\rjust as this sceptre (since he chanced to hold the sceptre in his hand)\rhewn, once and for all, from the lowest stem in the woods,\rhaving lost its parent trunk, and shedding its leaves and twigs \rto the knife, will never, now the craftsman\xc3\x95s hand has sheathed it\rin fine bronze, and given it to the elders of Latium \rto carry, extend shoots or shade from light foliage.\xc3\x95\rThey sealed the treaty between them with these words\rin full view of the leaders. Then with due rite they slaughtered\rthe sacrificial beasts over the flames, tore out the entrails, \rwhile they were alive, and piled the alters with heaped dishes.\r\rBKXII:216-265 THE RUTULIANS BREAK THE TREATY\r\rBut the duel had for a long time seemed unfair to the Rutulians, \rand their hearts were torn by varied emotions, more so\rwhen they saw the combatants\xc3\x95 unequal strength near to.\rTurnus added to the unrest, in advancing with silent tread\rand venerating the altar humbly, with downcast eyes,\rand by his wasted cheeks and the pallor of his youthful body.\rAs soon as his sister, Juturna, was aware that talk was spreading\rand the minds of the multitude were wavering in doubt,\rshe entered the heart of the army, in the guise of Camers,\rwhose birth was of noble ancestry, his father\xc3\x95s name\rfamous for virtue, and he himself of the bravest in arms,\rshe entered the heart of the army, not ignorant of her task,\rsowing various rumours and speaking as follows: \r\xc3\x94O Rutulians, aren\xc3\x95t you ashamed to sacrifice one life\ron behalf of so many of you ? Aren\xc3\x95t we their equals\rin numbers and might? See, all the Trojans and Arcadians\rare here, and the Etrurian band led by fate, and hostile to Turnus:\rif every other man attacks, there\xc3\x95s barely an opponent for each of them.\rTurnus will climb in glory to the gods, at whose altars\rhe has dedicated his life, and live borne on men\xc3\x95s lips:\rbut we will be forced to submit to proud masters, \rour country lost, we who now sit inactive in the field.\xc3\x95\rThe will of the young men was roused by these words, \rmore and more so, and a murmur spread through the ranks:\reven the Laurentines and the Latins changed their minds.\rThose who had lately hoped for rest from battle, and a safe existence, \rnow longed for weapons, prayed for the treaty to be broken,\rand pitied Turnus\xc3\x95s unjust fate. Juturna added another greater spur,\rshowing a sign in the depths of the sky, none more significant\rto disturb Italian minds, and charm them by the wonder of it.\rJove\xc3\x95s tawny eagle, flying through reddened air, \rstirred the shore-birds, with noisy confusion \rin their winged ranks, when suddenly diving to the water\rhe seized the most outstanding swan cruelly in his curved talons. \rThe Italians paid attention, and (amazing to see) \rall the birds wheeled, clamouring, in flight and, in a cloud,\rdrove their enemy through the air, darkening the sky \rwith their wings, until, defeated by force and the weight,\rthe bird gave way, and, dropping the prey \rfrom his talons into the river, fled deep into the clouds. \rThen the Rutulians truly hailed this omen with a shout \rand spread wide their hands, and Tolumnius the augur was first \rto cry out: \xc3\x94This, this was what my prayers have often sought.\rI understand it, and recognise the gods: snatch up the sword \rwith me, with me at your head, o unhappy race, fragile birds,\rwhom a cruel foreigner terrifies with war, ravaging\ryour coast with violence. He will take flight and sail\rfar away over the deep. Close ranks, together, and defend \rthe king who has been snatched from you, in battle.\r\rBKXII:266-310 RENEWED FIGHTING\r\rHe spoke, and running forward hurled his spear \rat the enemy: the hissing cornel shaft sang, and cut unerringly\rthrough the air, At one with this, at one, was a mighty shout\rthe army all in uproar, and hearts hot with the turmoil.\rThe spear flew on, to where, by chance, nine handsome brothers\rstood in its path, all of whom one faithful \rTuscan wife had borne to Arcadian Gylippus,\rIt struck one of them, a youth of great beauty, in shining armour,\rat the waist, where a stitched belt rubbed against \rhis stomach, and the buckle bit into the overlapping ends,\rpierced his ribs, and hurled him to the yellow sand.\rBut his spirited band of brothers, fired by grief,\rdrew their swords or snatched their iron spears,\rand rushed forward blindly. The Laurentine ranks\rcharged them: Trojans and Agyllines and Arcadians\rin decorated armour, poured in from the other side:\rso all had one longing, to let the sword decide.\rThey stripped the altars, there was a fierce storm \rof spears in the whole sky, and a steely rain fell:\rwine-bowls and hearthstones were carried off:\rLatinus himself fled, taking his defeated gods, \rthe treaty void. Others harnessed their chariots or leapt\ron their horses, and waited with drawn swords.\rMessapus, keen to destroy the truce, charging on his horse, \rscared off Auletes, an Etruscan king with a king\xc3\x95s emblems:\rthe unfortunate man, as he backed away, entangled, fell, \rhead and shoulders, on to the altar behind him: and Messapus \rflew at him furiously, spear in hand, and from his horse\xc3\x95s height\rstruck mightily at him with the massive weapon,\ras Auletes begged piteously, and spoke like this, over him:\r\xc3\x94He\xc3\x95s done for: this nobler victim is given to the great gods.\xc3\x95\rThe Italians crowded round and stripped the warm body.\rAgainst them, Corynaeus snatched a charred brand \rfrom an altar, and aiming a blow at the charging Ebyso\rdashed flames in his face: his great beard flared\rand gave off a smell of burning. Corynaeus following through\rhis blow, clutched the hair of his stunned enemy in his left hand\rand brought him to earth with a thrust of his bent knee:\rthen stabbed him in the side with his straight sword.\rPodalirius, towered over the shepherd Alsus, pursuing him\rwith naked steel as he ran through the shower of spears\rin the front rank: but Alsus swung his axe back,\rand sliced through the front of his enemy\xc3\x95s brow and chin,\rdrenching his armour with widely spouting blood.\rHarsh repose and iron slumber pressed on his eyes\rand their light was sunk in everlasting night.\r\rBKXII:311-382 AENEAS WOUNDED: TURNUS RAMPANT\r\rBut virtuous Aeneas his head bared, unarmed, stretched out \rhis right hand, and called loudly to his troops:\r\xc3\x94Where are you running to? Why this sudden tide of discord?\rO, control your anger! The agreement has already been struck,\rand its terms fixed. I alone have the right to fight:\rLet me do so: banish your fears. I\xc3\x95ll prove the treaty sound\rwith this right hand: these rites mean Turnus is already mine.\xc3\x95\rAmidst these cries and words, see, a hissing arrow \rwinged its way towards him, launched by what hand,\rsent whirling by whom, was unknown, as was the chance\ror god that brought the Rutulians such honour:\rthe glorious pride in it was kept concealed,\rand no one boasted of wounding Aeneas.\rAs soon as Turnus saw Aeneas leave the ranks, his captains \rin confusion, he blazed with the fervour of sudden hope:\rhe called for weapons and horses as one, leapt proudly \rinto his chariot, and gripped the reins in his hands.\rHe gave many a brave man death in his swift passage.\rMany he overturned half-alive, crushed the ranks under his chariot,\ror seizing his spears showered them on those fleeing.\rJust as when blood-drenched Mars is roused, and clashes\rhis shield, by the icy streams of Hebrus and, inciting war, \rgives rein to his frenzied horses, so that they fly over the open plain\routrunning the south and west winds, and farthest Thrace groans\rto the beat of their hooves, while around him the forms of black \rTerror, Anger and Treachery, speed, the companions of the god:\rwith the same swiftness Turnus lashed his horses, \rsmoking with sweat, through the midst of the conflict, \rtrampling on enemies piteously slain, while the galloping hooves \rsplashed bloody dew, and trampled the gore mixed with sand.\rNext he gave Sthenelus to death, Thamyrus, and Pholus, the latter\rclose to, the former at a distance, from a distance too\rboth sons of Imbrasas, Glaucus and Laudes, whom Imbrasus\rhimself had raised in Lycia, and equipped with matching armour, \rto fight hand to hand, or outstrip the wind on horseback.\rElsewhere Eumedes rode through the midst of the battle,\rfamous in warfare, the son of aged Dolon, \rrecalling the grandfather in name, his father in courage\rand skill, he who, in going as a spy that time to the Greek camp, \rdared to ask for Achilles\xc3\x95s chariot as his reward:\rbut Diomedes paid him a different reward for his daring\rand he no longer aspired to Achilles\xc3\x95s team.\rWhen Turnus saw Eumedes, far over the open plain, he first \rsent a light javelin after him across the long space between, \rthen halted his paired horses, leapt from his chariot,\ronto the half-dead, fallen man, and, planting his foot on his neck,\rtore the sword from his hand, and bloodied the bright blade\rdeep in his throat, adding these words as well:\r\xc3\x94See the fields, that Western Land, you sought in war:\rlie there and measure it: this is the prize for those\rwho dare to cross swords with me, thus they build their walls.\xc3\x95\rThen with a cast of his spear he sent Asbytes to keep him company,\rChloreus and Sybaris, Dares and Thersilochus, and Thymoetes\rwho was flung from the neck of his rearing horse.\rAs when the blast of the Edonian northerly sounds\rover the Aegean deep, and drives the breakers to shore,\rwhile brooding gusts in the sky put the clouds to flight,\rso, wherever Turnus cut a path, the lines gave way,\rand the ranks turned and ran: his own speed carried him on,\rand, as the chariot met it, the wind tossed his flowing plume.\rPhegeus could not endure his attack or his spirited war-cry:\rhe threw himself at the chariot and with his right hand wrenched\rthe heads of the swift horses aside, as they foamed at the bit.\rWhile he was dragged along, hanging from the yoke,\rTurnus\xc3\x95s broad-headed lance reached for his exposed flank,\rtore open the double-stranded mail where it entered,\rand grazed the surface of the flesh in a wound.\rPhegeus still turned towards his enemy, his shield raised,\rand was trying to protect himself with his drawn sword,\rwhen the wheel and the onrush of the spinning axle \rsent him headlong, throwing him to the ground, and Turnus,\rfollowing through, struck off his head with a sweep of his blade\rbetween the rim of the helmet and the chain-mail\xc3\x95s \rupper edge, and left the body lying on the sand.\r\rBKXII:383-467 VENUS HEALS AENEAS\r\rWhile Turnus was victoriously dealing death over the plain,\rMnestheus and loyal Achates, with Ascanius\rby their side, set Aeneas down inside the camp,\rbleeding, supporting alternate steps with his long spear.\rhe struggled furiously to pull out the head of the broken \rshaft, and called for the quickest means of assistance:\rto cut open the wound with a broadsword, lay open \rthe arrow-tip\xc3\x95s buried depths, and send him back to war.\rNow Iapyx, Iasus\xc3\x95s son, approached, dearest of all to Apollo,\rto whom the god himself, struck by deep love, long ago\roffered with delight his own arts, his own gifts, \rhis powers of prophecy, his lyre, and swift arrows.\rBut Iapyx, in order to delay the fate of his dying father,\rchose knowledge of the virtues of herbs, and the use \rof medicine, and, without fame, to practise the silent arts.\rAeneas stood leaning on his great spear, complaining bitterly,\ramongst a vast crowd of soldiers, with Iulus sorrowing,\rhimself unmoved by the tears. The aged Iapyx, his robe rolled back\rin Paeonian fashion, tried hard in vain with healing fingers \rand Apollo\xc3\x95s powerful herbs: he worked at the arrow uselessly \rwith his hand, and tugged at the metal with tightened pincers.\rNo luck guided his course, nor did Apollo his patron help,\rwhile cruel terror grew greater and greater over the plain,\rand evil drew near. Now they saw the sky standing on\rcolumns of dust: the horsemen neared and arrows fell\rthickly in the midst of the camp. A dismal cry rose to heaven\rof men fighting and falling under Mars\xc3\x95s harsh hand.\rAt this Aeneas\xc3\x95s mother, Venus, shaken by her son\xc3\x95s \rcruel pain, culled a dittany plant from Cretan Ida,\rwith downy leaves and purple flowers: a herb\rnot unknown to the wild goats when winged\rarrows have fixed themselves in their sides.\rThis Venus brought, her face veiled in dark mist,\rthis, with its hidden curative powers, she steeped \rin river water, poured into a glittering basin, and sprinkled\rthere healing ambrosial juice and fragrant panacea.\rAged Iapyx bathed the wound with this liquid,\rnot knowing its effect, and indeed all pain fled\rfrom Aeneas\xc3\x95s body, all the flow of blood ceased deep\rin the wound. Now, without force, the arrowhead\rslipped from the wound, following the motion of his hand,\rand fresh strength returned to Aeneas, such as before.\rIapyx cried: \xc3\x94Quickly, bring our hero weapons. Why are you\rstanding there?\xc3\x95  and was first to excite their courage against\rthe enemy. \xc3\x94Aeneas, this cure does not come by human aid,\rnor guiding art, it is not my hand that saved you: a god, \ra greater one, worked this, and sends you out again to glorious deeds.\xc3\x95\rAeneas, eager for battle, had sheathed his legs in gold,\rleft and right, and scornful of delay, brandished his spear.\rAs soon as his shield was fixed at his side, the chain mail \rto his back, he clasped Ascanius in his armed embrace,\rand, kissing his lips lightly through the helmet, said:\r\xc3\x94My son, learn courage from me and true labour:\rgood fortune from others. Now my hand will protect you \rin war, and lead you to great rewards. Make sure later, \rwhen your years have reached maturity, that you remember: \rlet your father Aeneas, and your uncle Hector\rinspire your soul, by recalling their example.\xc3\x95\rWhen he spoken these words, he rushed out through the gate,\rin all his strength, brandishing a great spear in his hand:\rAntheus and Mnestheus with him, and their massed ranks, and all \rthe army streamed from the camp. Then the plain was a chaos\rof blinding dust, and the quaking earth shook under the tramp of feet.\rTurnus saw them advance, from the rampart opposite:\rthe Ausonians saw, and a cold tremor ran to the marrow\rof their bones: Juturna was the first of all the Latins \rto hear and recognise the sound, and she fled in fear.\rAeneas flew ahead, racing his dark ranks over the open plain,\rAs when the weather breaks and a storm cloud moves towards\rland, over the deep ocean (ah, the hearts of wretched farmers\rknow if from far off, and shudder: it brings ruin to trees, \rand havoc to harvests, everything far and wide is destroyed),\rthe gales run before it and carry their roar to the shore:\rso the Trojan leader drove his ranks against the foe,\rthickly they all gathered to him in dense columns.\rThymbreus struck mighty Osiris with his sword,\rMnestheus killed Arcetius: Achates killed Epulo,\rGyas killed Ufens: even Tolumnius the augur fell,\rfirst to hurl his spear straight at the enemy.\rA shout rose to heaven, and in turn the routed Rutulians\rturned their backs in a cloud of dust, fleeing over the field.\rAeneas himself did not deign to send the fugitives to their death,\rnor did he attack the foot-soldiers, cavalry or those hurling \rmissiles: he tracked only Turnus, searching through \rthe dense gloom, Turnus alone he summoned to combat.\r\rBKXII:468-499 JUTURNA FOILS AENEAS\r\rJuturna, the warrior maiden, her mind stricken with fear,\rknocked Turnus\xc3\x95s charioteer, Metiscus, from the reins, at this,\rso that he slipped from the beam, and left him far behind:\rshe herself took his place, and guided the flowing reins \rwith her hands, assuming Meniscus\xc3\x95s voice, form, weapons, all.\rAs when a dark swallow flies through the great house \rof some rich lord, winging her way through lofty halls\rgathering tiny crumbs and scraps of food for her noisy young,\rnow twittering in the empty courtyards, now by the damp ponds:\rso Juturna was drawn by the horses through the enemy centre\rand, flying in her swift chariot, criss-crossed the whole plain,\rnow here, now there, she gives evidence of her triumphant brother,\rnot allowing him close combat, flying far away.\rNevertheless Aeneas traversed her winding course to meet him,\rtracking him, calling him loudly among the ranks.\rAs often as he set eyes on his enemy, and tried to match\rthe flight of the swift horses in his course, as often\rJuturna turned and wheeled the chariot. \rAh, what to do? Vainly he fluctuated on the shifting tide,\rand diverse concerns called his thoughts away.\rMessapus, who happened to be carrying two strong spears\rtipped with steel, advanced lightly towards him,\rlevelled one, and hurled it with unerring aim.\rAeneas stopped, and gathered himself behind his shield\rsinking on one knee: the swift spear still took off the tip\rof his helmet, and knocked the plumes from the crest.\rThen his anger truly surged, and incited by all this treachery,\rseeing his enemy\xc3\x95s chariot and horses driven far off,\rcalling loudly on Jove, and the altars of the broken treaty, \ras witness, he plunged at last into the fray, \rand, aided by Mars, he awoke dreadful, savage, \rindiscriminate slaughter, and gave full rein to his wrath.\r\rBKXII:500-553 AENEAS AND TURNUS AMONGST THE SLAUGHTER\r\rWhat god can now relate for me such bitter things as these,\rwho can tell of such varied slaughter, the deaths of generals,\rwhom Turnus now, and now the Trojan hero, drove in turn\rover the field? Jupiter was it your will that races who would live\rtogether in everlasting peace should meet in so great a conflict?\rAeneas meeting Rutulian Sucro (in the first battle \rthat brought the Trojan attack to a halt) quickly struck him\rin the side, and drove the cruel steel through the ribs\rthat protect the heart, where death come fastest. \rTurnus threw Amycus from his horse, and Diores his brother, \rattacking them on foot, striking one with the long lance \ras he advanced, the other with his sword, then hanging both \rtheir severed heads from his chariot carried them away\rdripping with blood. Aeneas sent Talos and Tanais \rand brave Cethegus to death, three in one attack, \rand sad Onites of Theban name, whose mother was Peridia:\rTurnus killed the brothers sent from Lycia, Apollo\xc3\x95s fields,\rand Menoetes of Arcadia, who had hated war, but in vain:\rhis humble home and his living were round Lerna\xc3\x95s\rfish-filled streams, never knowing the patronage \rof the great, and his father farmed rented land. \rLike fires set burning from opposite sides of a dry forest\rinto the thickets of crackling laurel, or foaming rivers\rfalling swiftly from the mountain heights, roaring\rand racing seawards, each leaving its path of destruction,\rso Aeneas and Turnus with no less fury swept through the battle:\rnow anger surged within: now their hearts which knew no defeat \rwere bursting: now with all their strength they set out to do harm.\rAs he boasted of his fathers, and the antiquity of his ancestors\xc3\x95 \rnames, and all his race traced back through Latin kings,\rAeneas sent Murranus headlong with a stone, a great whirling rock,\rand hurled him to the ground: beneath the reins and yoke,\rthe wheels churned him round, and the horses\xc3\x95 hooves,\rforgetful of their master, trampled him under with many a blow.\rTurnus met Hyllus as he charged, roaring with boundless pride,\rand hurled a spear at his gilded forehead: piercing \rthe helmet the weapon lodged in his brain. Cretheus,\rbravest of Greeks, your right hand did not save you \rfrom Turnus, nor did the gods hide Cupencus when Aeneas\rcame: he set his chest against the weapon\xc3\x95s track, \rand the bronze shield\xc3\x95s resistance profited the wretch nothing.\rThe Laurentine field saw you fall also, Aeolus,\ron your back, sprawled wide on the ground.\rYou fell, whom the Greek battalions could not lay low, nor Achilles \rwho overturned Priam\xc3\x95s kingdom: here was the boundary \rof death for you: your noble house was below Mount Ida, \rthat noble house at Lyrnesus, your grave in Laurentine soil.  \rAll the lines turned towards battle, the whole of the Latins,\rthe whole of the Trojans, Mnestheus and fierce Serestus,\rMessapus, tamer of horses, and brave Asilas,\rthe Tuscan phalanx, Evander\xc3\x95s Arcadian squadron,\reach for himself, men straining with all their strength:\rno respite and no rest: exerting themselves in one vast conflict.\r\rBKXII:554-592 AENEAS ATTACKS THE CITY\r \rNow his loveliest of mothers set in his mind the idea \rof moving against the walls, and turning his army on the city,\rswiftly, to confound the Latins with sudden ruin.\rWhile he tracked Turnus here and there through the ranks\rand swept his glance this way and that, he could see\rthe city, free of fierce warfare and peacefully unharmed.\rSuddenly an image of a more ambitious act of war inflamed him:\rhe called the generals Mnestheus, Sergestus and brave Serestus,\rand positioned himself on a hillock, where the rest of the Trojan army\rgathered round in a mass, without dropping their shields or spears.\rStanding amongst them on the high mound he cried:\r\xc3\x94Let nothing impede my orders, Jupiter is with us, and let \rno one be slower to advance because this attempt is so sudden.\rToday I will overthrow that city, a cause of war, Latinus\xc3\x95s \rcapital itself, and lay its smoking roofs level with the ground,\runless they agree to accept our rule, and submit, in defeat.\rDo you think I can wait until Turnus can face battle with me,\rand chooses to meet with me again, though defeated before?\rO citizens, this man is the fountainhead and source of this wicked war.\rQuickly, bring burning brands, and re-establish the treaty, with fire.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke, and all his troops adopted wedge-formation, hearts \requal in emulation, and advanced in a dense mass towards the walls:\rin a flash, scaling ladders and sudden flames appeared.\rSome ran to the gates and cut down the leading defenders,\rothers hurled steel, and darkened the sky with missiles.\rAeneas himself, among the leaders, raised his hand, at the foot\rof the wall, accused Latinus in a loud voice, and called the gods\rto witness that he was being forced into battle again,\rthat the Italians were doubly enemies, another treaty was broken.\rDissension rose among the fearful citizens: some commanded \rthe city be opened, and the gates be thrown wide\rto the Trojans, and they dragged the king himself to the ramparts:\rothers brought weapons and hurried to defend the walls,\ras when a shepherd, who\xc3\x95s tracked a swarm to its lair \rconcealed in the rock, fills it with acrid smoke:\rthe bees inside, anxious for safety, rush round\rtheir wax fortress, and sharpen their anger in loud buzzing:\rthe reeking darkness rolls through their hive, the rocks\recho within to a blind humming, and fumes reach the clear air. \r\rBKXII:593-613 QUEEN AMATA\xc3\x95S SUICIDE\r\rNow further misfortune befell the weary Latins,\rand shook the whole city to its foundations with grief.\rWhen Queen Amata, from the palace, saw the enemy \rapproaching, the walls assaulted, flames mounting to the roofs,\rbut no opposing Rutulian lines, nor Turnus\xc3\x95s army,\rthe unhappy queen thought Turnus had been killed \rin combat, and, her mind distraught, in sudden anguish,\rshe cried out that she was the cause, the guilty one, the source\rof evil, and uttering many wild words in the frenzy \rof grief, wanting to die, she tore her purple robes,\rand fastened a hideous noose of death to a high beam.\rAs soon as the wretched Latin women knew of the disaster,\rfirst her daughter Lavinia fell into a frenzy, tearing at her golden\rtresses and rosy cheeks with her hands, then all the crowd\raround her: the wide halls echoed to their lamentations.\rFrom there the unhappy rumour spread throughout the city:\rSpirits sank: Latinus went about with rent clothing,\rstunned by his wife\xc3\x95s fate and his city\xc3\x95s ruin,\rfouling his white hair with clouds of vile dust,\rreproaching himself again and again for not having freely\rreceived Trojan Aeneas, and adopted him as his son-in-law.\r\rBKXII:614-696 TURNUS HEARS OF AMATA\xc3\x95S DEATH\r\rMeanwhile Turnus, fighting at the edge of the plain,\rwas pursuing the stragglers now, more slowly,\rand rejoicing less and less in his horses\xc3\x95 advance.\rThe breeze bore a clamour to him mingled \rwith an unknown dread, and the cheerless sounds \rof a city in chaos met his straining ears. \r\xc3\x94Ah, what is this great grief that shakes the walls?\rWhat is this clamour that rises from the distant city?\xc3\x95\rSo he spoke, anxiously grasping the reins and halting.\rAt this his sister, controlling chariot, horses and reins\rdisguised in the shape of his charioteer, Metiscus, \rcountered with these words: \xc3\x94Turnus, this way, let us chase\rthe sons of Troy, where victory forges the way ahead:\rthere are others with hands to defend our homes.\rAeneas is attacking the Italians, and stirring conflict:\rlet our hands too deal cruel death to the Trojans.\rYou will not leave the field inferior in battle honours\ror the number you have killed\xc3\x95 Turnus replied to this:\r\xc3\x94O sister, I recognised you long ago, when you first \rwrecked the truce with your guile, and dedicated yourself to warfare,\rand now too you hide your divinity in vain. But who desired\ryou to be sent down from Olympus to suffer such labours?\rWas it so you might see your unlucky brother\xc3\x95s death?\rWhat can I do? What chance can offer me life?\rI saw Murranus fall, before my very eyes, calling out\rto me, loudly, no one more dear to me than him remains,\ra mighty man, and overwhelmed by a mighty wound. \rUnfortunate Ufens fell, so he might not witness our shame:\rthe Trojans captured his body and his armour.\rShall I endure the razing of our homes (the one thing left)\rand not deny Drances\xc3\x95s words with my sword?\rShall I turn my back, and this country see Turnus run?\rIs it indeed so terrible to die? Oh be good to me, you Shades\rbelow, since the gods above have turned their faces from me.\rI will descend to you, a virtuous soul, innocent\rof blame, never unworthy of my great ancestors.\xc3\x95\rHe had barely spoken when Saces sped by, carried on a foaming \rhorse through the thick of the enemy, wounded full in the face\rby an arrow, and calling to Turnus by name as he rushed on:\r\xc3\x94Turnus, in you our last hope lies, pity your people.\rAeneas is explosive in arms, and threatens to throw down\rItaly\xc3\x95s highest citadel and deliver it to destruction, even now \rburning brands fly towards the roofs. The Latins turn their faces \rto you, their eyes are on you: King Latinus mutters to himself, \rwavering as to whom to call his sons, towards what alliance to lean.\rMoreover the queen, most loyal to you, has fallen \rby her own hand, and fled, in horror of the light.\rMessapus and brave Atinas, alone in front of the gates\rsustain our lines. Around them dense squadrons stand\ron every side, a harvest of steel that bristles with naked swords,\rwhile you drive your chariot over the empty turf.\xc3\x95\rStunned and amazed by this vision of multiple disaster,\rTurnus stood silently gazing: fierce shame surged\rin that solitary heart, and madness mingled with grief,\rlove stung to frenzy, consciousness of virtue.\rAs soon as the shadows dispersed, and light returned to his mind,\rhe turned his gaze, with blazing eyes, towards the walls,\rand looked back on the mighty city from his chariot.\rSee, now, a spiralling crest of flame fastened \ron a tower, and rolled skyward through the stories, \ra tower he had built himself with jointed beams,\rset on wheels, and equipped with high walkways.\rHe spoke: \xc3\x94Now, sister, now fate triumphs: no more delays:\rwhere god and cruel fortune calls, let me follow.\rI\xc3\x95m determined on meeting Aeneas, determined to suffer\rdeath, however bitter: you\xc3\x95ll no longer see me ashamed, sister.\rI beg you let me rage before I am maddened.\xc3\x95\rAnd, leaping swiftly from his chariot to the ground,\rhe ran through enemy spears, deserting his grieving sister,\rand burst, in his quick passage, through the ranks.\rAs when a rock torn from the mountaintop by a storm\rhurtles downward, washed free by a tempest of rain\ror loosened in time by the passage of the years,\rand the wilful mass plunges down the slope in a mighty rush\rand leaps over the ground, rolling trees, herds and men\rwith it: so Turnus ran to the city walls through the broken ranks,\rwhere the soil was most drenched with blood, and the air\rshrill with spears, signalled with his hand and began shouting aloud:\r\xc3\x94Rutulians stop now, and you Latins hold back your spears.\rWhatever fate is here, is mine: it is better that I alone\rmake reparation for the truce and decide it with the sword.\xc3\x95\rAll drew back, and left a space in their midst.\r\rBKXII:697-765 THE FINAL DUEL BEGINS\r\rNow Aeneas the leader hearing the name of Turnus\rleft the walls, and left the high fortress,\rcast aside all delay, broke off from every task,\rand exultant with delight clashed his weapons fiercely:\rvast as Mount Athos, or Mount Eryx, or vast as old Apennine\rhimself when he roars through the glittering holm-oaks\rand joys in lifting his snowy summit to heaven.\rNow all truly turned their eyes, stripping the armour \rfrom their shoulders, Rutulians, Trojans and Italians, \rthose who held the high ramparts and those whose ram \rbattered at the walls beneath. Latinus himself was amazed\rat these mighty men, born at opposite ends of the world,\rmeeting and deciding the outcome with their swords.\rAs soon as the field was clear on the open plain,\rthey both dashed quickly forward, hurling their spears first\rfrom a distance, rushing, with shield and ringing bronze, \rto battle. The earth groaned: they redoubled their intense\rsword-strokes, chance and skill mingled together.\rAnd as when two bulls charge head to head in mortal battle,\ron mighty Sila or on Taburnus\xc3\x95s heights, and in terror\rtheir keepers retreat, the whole herd stand silent with fear,\rand the heifers wait, mute, to see who will be \rlord of the forest, whom all the herds will follow,\ras they deal wounds to each other with immense force,\rgore with butting horns, and bathe neck and shoulders\rin streaming blood, while all the wood echoes to their bellowing:\rso Trojan Aeneas and the Daunian hero, Turnus, \rclashed their shields, and the mighty crash filled the sky.\rJupiter himself held up two evenly balanced scales\rbefore him, and placed in them the diverse fates of the two,\rto see whom the effort doomed, with whose weight death sank down. \rTurnus leapt forward thinking himself safe, rose to the full height \rof his body with uplifted sword, and struck: the Trojans \rand the anxious Latins cried out, both armies were roused. \rBut the treacherous blade snapped, and would have left the eager\rwarrior defenceless in mid-stroke, if immediate flight \rhad not saved him. He ran swifter than the east wind, \rwhen he saw that strange hilt in his exposed right hand.\rThe tale is that in headlong haste, when he first mounted\rbehind his yoked team for battle, he left his father\xc3\x95s sword\rbehind, and snatched up the blade of his charioteer, Metiscus:\rand that served him for a long while as the straggling Trojans\rturned their backs, but the mortal blade flew apart\rlike brittle ice at the stroke, on meeting Vulcan\xc3\x95s \rdivine armour: and the fragments gleamed on the yellow sand.\rSo Turnus ran madly this way and that over the plain, winding\raimless circles here and there: on all sides the Trojans \rimprisoned him in their crowded ring, and a vast marsh\rpenned him on one side, on the other the steep ramparts.\rAenaeas, no less, though his knees, slowed at times\rby the arrow wound, failed him and denied him speed,\rpursued and pressed his anxious enemy hotly, foot to foot:\ras when a hound in the hunt presses on a stag, chasing \rand barking, one found trapped by the river or hedged in \rby fear of the crimson feathers: the stag, terrified \rby the snares and the high banks, flies backwards and forwards\ra thousand ways, but the eager Umbrian clings close\rwith gaping mouth, almost has him, and snaps his jaws\ras though he holds him, baffled and biting empty air:\rThen a clamour breaks out indeed, the pools and banks\raround echo, and the whole sky rings with the tumult.\rAs he fled Turnus chided the Rutulians, calling on each\rby name and calling out for his own familiar sword.\rAeneas in turn threatened death and immediate destruction\rif any one approached, and terrified his trembling enemies\rthreatening to raze the city, and pressing on though wounded.\rThey completed five circuits, and unwound as many,\rthis way and that: since they sought for no paltry prize \rat the games, but vied for Turnus\xc3\x95s life blood.\r\rBKXII:766-790 THE GODDESSES INTERVENE\r\rBy chance this was the place where a bitter-leaved\rwild olive, sacred to Faunus, had stood, a tree revered\rby sailors of old, where, when saved from the sea, they used\rto hang their gifts to the Laurentine god, and the votive garments:\rbut the Trojans had removed the sacred trunk, allowing\rof no exceptions, in order to fight on open ground.\rHere stood Aeneas\xc3\x95s spear, its impetus had carried it there,\rfixed and held fast by the tough roots. The Trojan halted,\rintending to pluck out the steel with his hand,\rand pursue the man he couldn\xc3\x95t catch by running, \rwith his javelin. Then Turnus mad with anxiety indeed cried: \r\xc3\x94Faunus, pity me, I pray, and you, most gracious Earth\rif I have every honoured your rites that the sons of Aeneas\rhave instead defiled by war, retain the steel.\xc3\x95\rHe spoke, and did not invoke the power of heaven in vain,\rsince Aeneas could not prise open the wood\xc3\x95s grip,\rby any show of strength, though he wrestled long and lingered\rover the strong stump. While he tugged and strained fiercely, Juturna,\rthe Daunian goddess, changing again to the shape of Metiscus,\rthe charioteer, ran forward and restored his sword to her brother.\rBut Venus, enraged that this was allowed the audacious nymph,\rapproached, and plucked the javelin from the deep root.\rRefreshed with weapons and courage, one relying on his sword,\rthe other towering fiercely with his spear, both breathing hard,\rthey stood, tall, face to face, in martial conflict. \r\rBKXII:791-842 JUPITER AND JUNO DECIDE THE FUTURE\r \rThe king of almighty Olympus meanwhile was speaking \rto Juno, as she gazed at the fighting from a golden cloud:\r\xc3\x94Wife, what will the end be now? What will be left in the end?\rYou know yourself, and confess you know, that Aeneas,\ris destined for heaven as the nation\xc3\x95s god: the Fates raise him to the stars.\rWhat are you planning? What hope do you cling to in the cold clouds?\rWas it right that this god be defiled by a mortal\xc3\x95s wound?\rOr that the lost sword (for what could Juturna achieve without you?)\rbe restored to Turnus, the defeated gaining new strength?\rNow cease, at last, and give way to my entreaties,\rlest such sadness consume you in silence, and your bitter\rwoes stream back to me often from your sweet lips.\rIt has reached its end. You have had the power to drive\rthe Trojans over land and sea, to stir up evil war,\rto mar a house, and mix marriage with grief:\rI forbid you to attempt more.\xc3\x95 So Jupiter spoke:\rso, with humble look, the Saturnian goddess replied:\r\xc3\x94Great Jupiter, truly, it was because I knew it was your wish\rthat I parted reluctantly from Turnus and the Earth:\ror you would not see me alone now, on my celestial perch,\renduring the just and the unjust, but I\xc3\x95d be standing, wreathed in flame,\rin the battle line itself, and drawing the Trojans into deadly combat.\rI counselled Juturna (I confess) to help her unfortunate brother\rand approved greater acts of daring for the sake of his life,\ryet not for her to contend with the arrow or the bow:\rI swear it by the implacable fountainhead of Styx, \rthat alone is held in awe by the gods above.\rAnd now I yield, yes, and leave the fighting I loathe.\rYet I beg this of you, for Latium\xc3\x95s sake, for the majesty \rof your own kin: since it is not prohibited by any law of fate: \rwhen they soon make peace with happy nuptials (so be it)\rwhen they join together soon in laws and treaties,\rdon\xc3\x95t order the native Latins to change their ancient name,\rto become Trojans or be called Teucrians,\ror change their language, or alter their clothing.\rLet Latium still exist, let there be Alban kings through the ages,\rlet there be Roman offspring strong in Italian virtue:\rTroy has fallen, let her stay fallen, along with her name.\xc3\x95\rSmiling at her, the creator of men and things replied:\r\xc3\x94You are a true sister of Jove, another child of Saturn,\rsuch waves of anger surge within your heart.\rCome, truly, calm this passion that was needlessly roused:\rI grant what you wish, and I relent, willingly defeated.\rAusonia\xc3\x95s sons will keep their father\xc3\x95s speech and manners,\ras their name is, so it will be: the Trojans shall sink, merged\rinto the mass, only. I will add sacred laws and rites,\rand make them all Latins of one tongue.\rFrom them a race will rise, merged with Ausonian blood,\rthat you will see surpass men and gods in virtue,\rno nation will celebrate your rites with as much devotion.\xc3\x95\rJuno agreed it, and joyfully altered her purpose:\rthen left her cloud, and departed from the sky.\r\rBKXII:843-886 JUPITER SENDS JUTURNA A SIGN\r\rThis done the Father turns something else over in his mind\rand prepares to take Juturna from her brother\xc3\x95s side.\rMen speak of twin plagues, named the Dread Ones,\rwhom Night bore untimely, in one birth with Tartarean Megaera,\rwreathing them equally in snaky coils, and adding wings swift\ras the wind. They wait by Jove\xc3\x95s throne on the fierce king\xc3\x95s\rthreshold, and sharpen the fears of weak mortals \rwhenever the king of the gods sends plagues \rand death\xc3\x95s horrors, or terrifies guilty cities with war.\rJupiter sent one of them quickly down from heaven\xc3\x95s heights\rand ordered her to meet with Juturna as a sign:\rshe flew, and darted to earth in a swift whirlwind.\rLike an arrow loosed from the string, through the clouds,\rthat a Parthian, a Parthian or a Cydonian, fired,\rhissing, and leaping unseen through the swift shadows,\ra shaft beyond all cure, armed with cruel poison\xc3\x95s venom:\rso sped the daughter of Night, seeking the earth.\rAs soon as she saw the Trojan ranks and Turnus\xc3\x95s troops,\rshe changed her shape, suddenly shrinking to the form of that\rsmall bird that perching at night on tombs or deserted rooftops, \roften sings her troubling song so late among the shadows \xc3\x90 \rand the fiend flew screeching to and fro in front \rof Turnus\xc3\x95s face, and beat at his shield with her wings.\rA strange numbness loosed his limbs in dread,\rhis hair stood up in terror, and his voice clung to his throat.\rBut when his wretched sister Juturna recognised the Dread One\xc3\x95s\rwhirring wings in the distance, she tore at her loosened hair, marring\rher face with her nails, and her breasts with her clenched hands:\r\xc3\x94What help can your sister give you now, Turnus?\rWhat is left for me who have suffered so? With what art\rcan I prolong your life? Can I stand against such a portent?\rNow at last I leave the ranks. Bird of ill-omen, do not you \rterrify me who already am afraid: I know your wing-beats\rand their fatal sound, and I do not mistake the proud command\rof great-hearted Jupiter. Is this his reward for my virginity?\rWhy did he grant me eternal life? Why is the mortal condition\rtaken from me? Then, at least, I could end such pain\rand go through the shadows at my poor brother\xc3\x95s side!\rAn immortal, I? Can anything be sweet to me without you\rmy brother? Oh what earth can gape deep enough for me,\rto send a goddess down to the deepest Shades?\xc3\x95\rSo saying she veiled her head in a grey mantle, and the goddess,\rwith many a cry of grief, plunged into the river\xc3\x95s depths.\r\rBKXII:887-952 THE DEATH OF TURNUS\r\rAeneas pressed on, brandishing his great spear like a tree,\rand, angered at heart, he cried out in this way: \r\xc3\x94Why now yet more delay? Why do you still retreat, Turnus? \rWe must compete hand to hand with fierce weapons, not by running.\rChange into every form: summon up all your powers \rof mind and art, wing your way if you wish \rto the high stars, or hide in earth\xc3\x95s hollow prison.\xc3\x95\rTurnus shook his head: \xc3\x94Fierce man, your fiery words\rdon\xc3\x95t frighten me: the gods terrify me and Jupiter\xc3\x95s enmity.\xc3\x95\rSaying no more he looked round seeing a great rock,\ra vast ancient stone, that happened to lie there in the plain,\rset up as a boundary marker, to distinguish fields in dispute.\rTwelve picked men, men of such form as Earth \rnow produces, could scarcely have lifted it on their shoulders,\rbut the hero, grasping it quickly, rising to his full height \rand as swiftly as he could, hurled it at his enemy.\rBut he did not know himself, running or moving\rraising the great rock in his hands, or throwing:\rhis knees gave way, his blood was frozen cold.\rThe stone itself, whirled by the warrior through the empty air,\rfailed to travel the whole distance, or drive home with force.\rAs in dreams when languid sleep weighs down our eyes at night,\rwe seem to try in vain to follow our eager path,\rand collapse helpless in the midst of our efforts,\rthe tongue won\xc3\x95t work, the usual strength is lacking\rfrom our limbs, and neither word nor voice will come:\rso the dread goddess denied Turnus success,\rhowever courageously he sought to find a way.\rThen shifting visions whirled through his brain:\rhe gazed at the Rutulians, and at the city, faltered\rin fear, and shuddered at the death that neared,\rhe saw no way to escape, no power to attack his enemy,\rnor sign of his chariot, nor his sister, his charioteer.\rAs he wavered, Aeneas shook his fateful spear,\rseeing a favourable chance, and hurled it from the distance\rwith all his might. Stone shot from a siege engine\rnever roared so loud, such mighty thunder never burst\rfrom a lightning bolt. Like a black hurricane the spear flew on\rbearing dire destruction, and pierced the outer circle \rof the seven-fold shield, the breastplate\xc3\x95s lower rim,\rand, hissing, passed through the centre of the thigh.\rGreat Turnus sank, his knee bent beneath him, under the blow.\rThe Rutulians rose up, and groaned, and all the hills around \rre-echoed, and, far and wide, the woods returned the sound.\rHe lowered his eyes in submission and stretched out his right hand:\r\xc3\x94I have earned this, I ask no mercy\xc3\x95 he said, \r\xc3\x94seize your chance. If any concern for a parent\xc3\x95s grief\rcan touch you (you too had such a father, in Anchises)\r\r\r\r\r\rThe Fight between Aeneas and King Turnus\rGiacomo del Po (Italy, Naples, 1652-1726\rLACMA Collections\r\r\n\rI beg you to pity Daunus\xc3\x95s old age and return me,\ror if you prefer it my body robbed of life, to my people.\rYou are the victor, and the Ausonians have seen me \rstretch out my hands in defeat: Lavinia is your wife,\rdon\xc3\x95t extend your hatred further.\xc3\x95 Aeneas stood, fierce\rin his armour, his eyes flickered, and he held back his hand:\rand even now, as he paused, the words began to move him\rmore deeply, when high on Turnus\xc3\x95s shoulder young Pallas\xc3\x95s\rluckless sword-belt met his gaze, the strap glinting with its familiar\rdecorations, he whom Turnus, now wearing his enemy\xc3\x95s emblems\ron his shoulder, had wounded and thrown, defeated, to the earth.\rAs soon as his eyes took in the trophy, a memory of cruel grief,\rAeneas, blazing with fury, and terrible in his anger, cried:\r\xc3\x94Shall you be snatched from my grasp, wearing the spoils\rof one who was my own? Pallas it is, Pallas, who sacrifices you\rwith this stroke, and exacts retribution from your guilty blood.\xc3\x95\rSo saying, burning with rage, he buried his sword deep\rin Turnus\xc3\x95s breast: and then Turnus\xc3\x95s limbs grew slack \rwith death, and his life fled, with a moan, angrily, to the Shades.\r\r\r\n\r\n\rABOUT THE AUTHOR\r\rVirgil (Publius Vergilius Maro, also called Vergil) was born near Mantua, in Cisalpine Gaul, in 70BC. He is known for three major works of Latin literature, the Eclogues or pastoral poems, the Georgics a treatise on farming, and his epic the Aeneid. He benefited greatly from the enlightened patronage of Maecenas, an ally, friend and political advisor to the Emperor Augustus. Virgil dedicated the Georgics to Maecenas. According to tradition, Virgil visited Greece in order to revise the Aeneid which he wrote between 29 and 19BC. After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, he caught a fever and, after crossing to Italy, died in Brundisium (Brindisi)  in September of the latter year, his ashes reputedly being interred on the site of his villa near Naples, where a burial vault is shown today as Virgil\xc3\x95s Tomb. The Aeneid was published in full after his death, on the orders of Augustus.\r\rABOUT THE TRANSLATOR\r\rAnthony Kline lives in England. He graduated in Mathematics from the University of Manchester, and was Chief Information Officer (Systems Director) of a large UK Company, before dedicating himself to his literary work and interests. He was born in 1947. His work consists of translations of poetry; critical works, biographical history with poetry as a central theme; and his own original poetry. He has translated into English from Latin, Ancient Greek, Classical Chinese and the European languages. He also maintains a deep interest in developments in Mathematics and the Sciences.\r    He continues to write predominantly for the Internet, making all works available in download format, with an added focus on the rapidly developing area of electronic books. His most extensive works are complete translations of Ovid's Metamorphoses and Dante's Divine Comedy.\r\r\r\r330\r\r\r7\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook I\r\r327\r\r\r\r\r40\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook II\r\r\r\r\r\r329\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook III\r\r\r\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook IV\r\r\r\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook V\r\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook VI\r\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook VII\r\r\r\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook VIII\r\r\r\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook IX\r\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook X\r\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook XI\r\r\r\rThe Aeneid\r\rBook XII\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n"
