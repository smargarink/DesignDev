b'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeowulf  \r\n Translation by Seamus Heaney \r\nSo. The Spear-Danes in days gone by \r\nAnd the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness. We have heard of those princes\xe2\x80\x99 heroic campaigns. \r\nThere was Shield Sheafson, scourge of many tribes, \r\nA wrecker of mead-benches, rampaging among foes. This terror of the hall-troops had come far. \r\nA foundling to start with, he would flourish later on \r\nAs his powers waxed and his worth was proved. \r\nIn the end each clan on the outlying coasts \r\nBeyond the whale-road had to yield to him 10 And begin to pay tribute. That was one good king. \r\nAfterwards a boy-child was born to Shield, \r\nA cub in the yard, a comfort sent \r\nBy God to that nation. He knew what they had tholed, The long times and troubles they\xe2\x80\x99d come through \r\nWithout a leader; so the Lord of Life, \r\nThe glorious Almighty, made this man renowned. \r\nShield had fathered a famous son: \r\nBeow\xe2\x80\x99s name was known through the north. \r\nAnd a young prince must be prudent like that, 20 Giving freely while his father lives \r\nSo that afterwards in age when fighting starts \r\nSteadfast companions will stand beside him \r\nAnd hold the line. Behavior that\xe2\x80\x99s admired \r\nIs the path to power among people everywhere. \r\nShield was still thriving when his time came \r\nAnd he crossed over into the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s keeping. \r\nHis warrior band did what he bade them\r\nWhen he laid down the law among the Danes: \r\nThey shouldered him out to the sea\xe2\x80\x99s flood, 30 The chief they revered who had long ruled them. \r\nA ring-whorled prow rode in the harbour, \r\nIce-clad, outbound, a craft for a prince. \r\nThey stretched their beloved lord in his boat, \r\nLaid out by the mast, amidships, \r\nThe great ring-giver. Far-fetched treasures  \r\nWere piled upon him, and precious gear. \r\nI never heard before of a ship so well furbished \r\nWith battle tackle, bladed weapons \r\nAnd coats of mail. The massed treasure 40 Was loaded on top of him: it would travel far \r\nOn out into the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s sway. \r\nThey decked his body no less bountifully \r\nWith offerings than those first ones did \r\nWho cast him away when he was a child \r\nAnd launched him alone out over the waves. \r\nAnd they set a gold standard up \r\nHigh above his head and let him drift \r\nTo wind and tide, bewailing him \r\nAnd mourning their loss. No man can tell, 50 No wise man in hall or weathered veteran \r\nKnows for certain who salvaged that load. \r\nThen it fell to Beow to keep the forts. \r\nHe was well regarded and ruled the Danes \r\nFor a long time after his father took leave \r\nOf his life on earth. And then his heir, \r\nThe great Halfdane, held sway \r\nFor as long as he lived, their elder and warlord. \r\nHe was four times a father, this fighter prince: \r\nOne by one they entered the world, 60 Heorogar, Hrothgar, the good Halga \r\nAnd a daughter, I have heard, who was Onela\xe2\x80\x99s queen,\r\nA balm in bed to the battle-scarred Swede. \r\nThe fortunes of war favored Hrothgar. \r\nFriends and kinsmen flocked to his ranks, \r\nYoung followers, a force that grew \r\nTo be a mighty army. So his mind turned \r\nTo hall-building: he handed down orders \r\nFor men to work on a great mead-hall \r\nMeant to be a wonder of the world forever; 70 It would be his throne-room and there he would dispense His God-given goods to young and old--- \r\nBut not the common land or people\xe2\x80\x99s lives. \r\nFar and wide through the world, I have heard, Orders for work to adorn that wall stead \r\nWere sent to many peoples. And soon it stood there, Finished and ready, in full view, \r\nThe hall of halls. Heorot was the name \r\nHe had settled on it, whose utterance was law. Nor did he renege, but doled out rings 80 And torques at the table. The hall towered, \r\nIts gables wide and high and awaiting \r\nA barbarous burning. That doom abided, \r\nBut in time it would come: the killer instinct \r\nUnleashed among in-laws, the blood-lust rampant. Then a powerful demon, a prowler through the dark, Nursed a hard grievance. It harrowed him \r\nTo hear the din of the loud banquet \r\nEvery day in the hall, the harp being struck \r\nAnd the clear song of a skilled poet 90  Telling with mastery of man\xe2\x80\x99s beginnings, \r\nHow the Almighty had made the earth \r\nA gleaming plain girdled with waters; \r\nIn His splendour He set the sun and moon \r\nTo be earth\xe2\x80\x99s lamplight, lanterns for men, \r\nAnd filled the broad lap of the world\r\nWith branches and leaves; and quickened life In every other thing that moved. \r\nSo times were pleasant for the people there \r\nUntil finally one, a fiend out of Hell, 100 Began to work his evil in the world. \r\nGrendel was the name of this grim demon \r\nHaunting the marches, marauding round the heath And the desolate fens; he had dwelt for a time In misery among the banished monsters, \r\nCain\xe2\x80\x99s clan, whom the creator had outlawed \r\nAnd condemned as outcasts. For the killing of Abel The Eternal Lord had exacted a price: \r\nCain got no good from committing that murder Because the Almighty made him anathema 110 And out of the curse of his exile there sprang Ogres and elves and evil phantoms \r\nAnd the giants too who strove with God \r\nTime and again until He gave them their final reward.  \r\nSo, after nightfall, Grendel set out \r\nFor the lofty house, to see how the Ring-Danes Were settling into it after their drink, \r\nAnd there he came upon them, a company of the best Asleep from their feasting, insensible to pain And human sorrow. Suddenly then 120 The God-cursed brute was creating havoc: \r\nGreedy and grim, he grabbed thirty men \r\nFrom their resting places and rushed to his lair, Flushed up and inflamed from the raid, \r\nBlundering back with the butchered corpses. \r\nThen as dawn brightened and the day broke \r\nGrendel\xe2\x80\x99s powers of destruction were plain: \r\nTheir wassail was over, they wept to heaven\r\nAnd mourned under morning. Their mighty prince, The storied leader, sat stricken and helpless, 130 Humiliated by the loss of his guard, \r\nBewildered and stunned, staring aghast \r\nAnd the demon\xe2\x80\x99s trail, in deep distress. \r\nHe was numb with grief, but got no respite \r\nFor one night later the merciless Grendel \r\nStruck again with more gruesome murders. \r\nMalignant by nature, he never showed remorse. It was easy then to meet with a man \r\nShifting himself to a safer distance \r\nTo bed in the bothies, for who could be blind 140 To the evidence of his eyes, the obviousness \r\nOf that hall-watcher\xe2\x80\x99s hate? Whoever escaped \r\nKept a weather-eye open and moved away. \r\nSo Grendel ruled in defiance of right, \r\nOne against all, until the greatest house \r\nIn the world stood empty, a deserted wall stead. For twelve winters, seasons of woe, \r\nThe lord of the Shieldings suffered under \r\nHis load of sorrow; and so, before long, \r\nThe news was known over the whole world. 150 Sad lays were sung about the beset king, \r\nThe vicious raids of Grendel, \r\nHis long and unrelenting feud, \r\nNothing but war; how he would never  \r\nParley or make peace with any Dane \r\nNor stop his death-dealing nor pay the death-price. No counsellor could ever expect \r\nFair reparation from those rabid hands. \r\nAll were endangered; young and old \r\nWere hunted down by that dark death-shadow 160  Who lurked and swooped in the long nights \r\nOn the misty moors; nobody knows\r\nWhere these reavers from Hell roam on their errands. \r\nSo Grendel waged his lonely war, \r\nInflicting constant cruelties on the people, \r\nAtrocious hurt. He took over Heorot, \r\nHaunted the glittering hall after dark, \r\nBut the throne itself, the treasure-seat, \r\nHe was kept from approaching; he was the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s outcast. \r\nThese were hard times, heart-breaking 170 For the prince of the Shieldings; powerful counselors, The highest in the land, would lend advice, \r\nPlotting how best the bold defenders \r\nMight resist and beat off sudden attacks. \r\nSometimes at pagan shrines they vowed \r\nOffering to idols, swore oaths \r\nThat the killer of souls might come to their aid And save the people. That was their way, \r\nTheir heathenish hope; deep in their hearts \r\nThey remembered Hell. The Almighty Judge 180 Of good deeds and bad, the Lord God, \r\nHead of the Heavens and High King of the World, Was unknown to them. Oh, cursed is he \r\nWho in time of trouble had to thrust his soul In the fire\xe2\x80\x99s embrace, forfeiting help; \r\nHe has nowhere to turn. But blessed is he \r\nWho after death can approach the Lord \r\nAnd find friendship in the Father\xe2\x80\x99s embrace. \r\nSo that troubled time continued, woe \r\nThat never stopped, steady affliction 190 For Halfdane\xe2\x80\x99s son, too hard an ordeal. \r\nThere was panic after dark, people endured \r\nRaids in the night, riven by terror.\r\nWhen he heard about Grendel, Hygelac\xe2\x80\x99s thane Was on home ground, over in Geatland. \r\nThere was no one else like him alive. \r\nIn his day, he was the mightiest man on earth, \r\nHigh-born and powerful. He ordered a boat \r\nThat would ply the waves. He announced his plan: To sail the swan\xe2\x80\x99s roads and search out that king, 200 The famous prince who needed defenders. \r\nNobody tried to keep him from going, \r\nNo elder denied him, dear as he was to them. \r\nInstead, they inspected omens and spurred \r\nHis ambition to go, whilst he moved about \r\nLike the leader he was, enlisting men, \r\nThe best he could find; with fourteen others \r\nThe warrior boarded the boat as captain, \r\nA canny pilot along coast and currents. \r\nTime went by, the boat was on water, 210 In close under the cliffs. \r\nMen climbed eagerly up the gangplank, \r\nSand churned in surf, shining war-gear \r\nIn the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s hold, then heaved out, \r\nAway with a will in their wood-wreathed ship. Over the waves, with the wind behind her \r\nAnd foam at her neck, she flew like a bird \r\nUntil her curved prow had covered the distance And on the following day, at the due hour, 220 Those seafarers sighted land, \r\nSunlit cliffs, sheer crags \r\nAnd looming headlands, the landfall they sought. It was the end of their voyage and the Geats vaulted Over the side, out on to the sand, \r\nAnd moored their ship. There was a clash of mail And a thresh of gear. They thanked God \r\nFor that easy crossing on a calm sea.\r\nWhen the watchman on the wall, the Shieldings\xe2\x80\x99 lookout Whose job it was to guard the sea-cliffs, 230 Saw shields glittering on the gangplank \r\nAnd battle-equipment being unloaded \r\nHe had to find out who and what \r\nThe arrivals were. So he rode to the shore, \r\nThis horseman of Hrothgar\xe2\x80\x99s, and challenged them In formal terms, flourishing his spear: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of men are you who arrive \r\nRigged out for combat in coats of mail, \r\nSailing here over the sea lanes \r\nIn your steep-hulled boat? I have been stationed 240 As lookout on this coast for a long time. \r\nMy job is to watch the waves for raiders, \r\nAnd danger to the Danish shore. \r\nNever before has a force under arms \r\nDisembarked so openly---not bothering to ask \r\nIf the sentries allowed them safe passage \r\nOr the clan had consented. Nor have I seen  \r\nA mightier man-at-arms on this earth \r\nThan the one standing here: unless I am mistaken, He is truly noble. This is no mere 250 Hanger-on in a hero\xe2\x80\x99s armour. \r\nSo now, before you fare inland \r\nAs interlopers, I have to be informed \r\nAbout who you are and where you hail from. \r\nOutsiders from across the water, \r\nI say it again: the sooner you tell \r\nWhere you came from and why, the better.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nThe leader of the troop unlocked his word-hoard; The distinguished one delivered this answer: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe belong by birth to the Geat people 260 And owe allegiance to Lord Hygelac.\r\nIn my day, my father was a famous man, \r\nA noble warrior name Ecgtheow. \r\nHe outlasted many a long winter \r\nAnd went on his way. All over the world \r\nWise men in council continue to remember him. We come in good faith to find your lord \r\nAnd nation\xe2\x80\x99s shield, the son of Halfdane. \r\nGive us the right to advise and direction. \r\nWe have arrived here on a great errand 270 To the lord of the Danes, and I believe therefore There should be nothing hidden or withheld between us. So tell us if what we have heard is true \r\nAbout this threat, whatever it is, \r\nThis danger abroad in the dark nights, \r\nThis corpse-maker mongering death \r\nIn the Shieldings\xe2\x80\x99 country. I come to proffer \r\nMy wholehearted help and counsel. \r\nI can show the wise Hrothgar a way \r\nTo defeat his enemy and find respite--- 280 If any respite is to reach him, ever. \r\nI can calm the turmoil and terror in his mind. \r\nOtherwise, he must endure woes \r\nAnd live with grief for as long as his hall \r\nStands at the horizon, on its high ground.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nUndaunted, sitting astride his horse, \r\nThe coast-guard answered, \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone with gumption And a sharp mind will take the measure \r\nOf two things: what\xe2\x80\x99s said and what\xe2\x80\x99s done. \r\nI believe what you have told me: that you are a troop 290 Loyal to our king. So come ahead  \r\nWith your arms and your gear, and I will guide you. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, I\xe2\x80\x99ll order my own comrades \r\nOn their word of honor to watch your boat \r\nDown there on the strand---keep her safe\r\nIn her fresh tar, until the time comes \r\nFor her curved prow to preen on the waves \r\nAnd bear this hero back to Geatland. \r\nMay one so valiant and venturesome \r\nCome unharmed through the clash of battle.\xe2\x80\x9d 300 \r\nSo they went on their way. The ship rode the water, Broad-beamed, bound by its hawser \r\nAnd anchored fast. Boar-shapes flashed \r\nAbove their cheek-guards, the brightly forged Work of goldsmiths, watching over \r\nThose stern-faced men. They marched in step, Hurrying on till the timbered hall \r\nRose before them, radiant with gold. \r\nNobody on earth knew of another \r\nBuilding like it. Majesty lodged there, 310 And its light shone over many lands. \r\nSo their gallant escort guided them \r\nTo that dazzling stronghold and indicated \r\nThe shortest way to it; then the noble warrior Wheeled on his horse and spoke these words: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time for me to go. May the Almighty \r\nFather keep you and in His kindness \r\nWatch over your exploits. I\xe2\x80\x99m away to the sea, Back on alert against enemy raiders.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nIt was a paved track, a path that kept them 320 In marching order. Their mail-shirts glinted, Hard and hand-linked; the high-gloss iron \r\nOf their armour rang. So they duly arrived \r\nIn their grim war-graith and gear at the hall, \r\nAnd, weary from the sea, stacked wide shields Of the toughest hardwood against the wall, \r\nThen collapsed on the benches; battle-dress \r\nAnd weapons clashed. They collected their spears\r\nIn a seafarer\xe2\x80\x99s stook, a stand of grayish  \r\nTapering ash. And the troops themselves 330 Were as good as their weapons. \r\n Then a proud warrior \r\nQuestioned the men concerning their origins: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come from, carrying these \r\nDecorated shields and shirts of mail, \r\nThese cheek-hinged helmets and javelins? \r\nI am Hrothgar\xe2\x80\x99s herald and officer. \r\nI have never seen so impressive or large \r\nAn assembly of strangers. Stoutness of heart, \r\nBravery not banishment, must have brought you to Hrothgar.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nThe man whose name was known for courage, 340 The Geat leader, resolute in his helmet, \r\nAnswered in return: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are retainers \r\nFrom Hygelac\xe2\x80\x99s band. Beowulf is my name. \r\nIf your lord and master, the most renowned \r\nSon of Halfdane, will hear me out \r\nAnd graciously allow me to greet him in person, I am ready and willing to report my errand.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nWulfgar replied, a Wendel chief \r\nRenowned as a warrior, well known for his wisdom And the temper of his mind: \xe2\x80\x9cI will take this message, 350 In accordance with your wish, to our noble king, Our dear lord, friend of the Danes, \r\nThe giver of rings. I will go and ask him \r\nAbout your coming here, then hurry back \r\nWith whatever reply it pleases him to give.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nWith that he turned to where Hrothgar sat, \r\nAn old man among retainers; \r\nThe valiant follower stood four-square \r\nIn front of his king: he knew the courtesies.\r\nWulfgar addressed his dear lord: 360 \xe2\x80\x9cPeople from Geatland have put ashore. \r\nThey have sailed far over the wide sea. \r\nThey call the chief in charge of their band \r\nBy the name of Beowulf. They beg, my lord, \r\nAn audience with you, exchange of words \r\nAnd formal greeting. Most gracious Hrothgar, \r\nDo not refuse them, but grant them a reply. \r\nFrom their arms and appointment, they appear well-born And worthy of respect, especially the one \r\nWho has led them this far: he is formidable indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d 370 \r\nHrothgar, protector of Shieldings, replied: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to know him when I was a young boy. \r\nHis father before him was called Ecgtheow. \r\nHrethel the Greath gave Ecgtheow \r\nHis daughter in marriage. This man is their son, Here to follow up an old friendship. \r\nA crew of seamen who sailed for me once \r\nWith a gift-cargo across to Geatland \r\nReturned with marvelous tales about him: \r\nA thane, they declared, with the strength of thirty 380 In the grip of each hand. Now Holy God \r\nHas, in His Goodness, guided him here \r\nTo the West-Danes, to defend us from Grendel. \r\nThis is my hope; and for his heroism \r\nI will recompense him with a rich treasure. \r\nGo immediately, bid him and the Geats \r\nHe has is attendance to assemble and enter. \r\nSay, moreover, when you speak to them, \r\nThat they are welcome in Denmark.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\n At the door of the hall, \r\nWulfgar duly delivered the message: 390 \xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, the conquering king of the Danes,\r\nBids me announce that he knows your ancestry; Also that he welcomes you here to Heorot \r\nAnd salutes your arrival from across the sea. \r\nYou are free now to move forward \r\nTo meet Hrothgar, in helmets and armor, \r\nBut shields must stay here and spears be stacked Until the outcome of the audience is clear.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nThe hero arose, surrounded closely \r\nBy his powerful thanes. A party remained 400 Under orders to keep watch on the arms; \r\nThe rest proceeded, lead by their prince \r\nUnder Heorot\xe2\x80\x99s roof. And standing on the hearth In webbed links that the smith had woven, \r\nThe fine-forged mesh of his gleaming mail shirt, Resolute in his helmet, Beowulf spoke: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreetings to Hrothgar. I am Hygelac\xe2\x80\x99s kinsman, One of his hall-troop. When I was younger, \r\nI had great triumphs. Then news of Grendel, \r\nHard to ignore, reached me at home: 410 Sailors brought stories of the plight you suffer In this legendary hall, how it lies deserted, \r\nEmpty and useless once the evening light \r\nHides itself under Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s dome. \r\nSo every elder and experience councilman \r\nAmong my people supported my resolve  \r\nTo come here to you, King Hrothgar, \r\nBecause all knew of my awesome strength. \r\nThey had seen me boltered in the blood of enemies When I battled and bound five beasts, 420 Raided a troll-nest and in the night-sea \r\nSlaughtered sea-brutes. I have suffered extremes And avenged the Geats (their enemies brought it Upon themselves, I devastated them). \r\nNow I mean to be a match for Grendel, \r\nSettle the outcome in a single combat.\r\nAnd so, my request, O king of Bright-Danes, \r\nDear prince pf the Shieldings, friend of the people And their ring of defense, my one request \r\nIs that you won\xe2\x80\x99t refuse me, who have come this far, 430 The privilege of purifying Heorot, \r\nWith my own men to help me, and nobody else. \r\nI have heard moreover that the monster scorns \r\nIn his reckless way to use weapons; \r\nTherefore, to heighten Hygelac\xe2\x80\x99s fame \r\nAnd gladden his heart, I hereby renounce \r\nSword and the shelter of the broad shield, \r\nThe heavy war-board: hand-to-hand \r\nIs how it will be, a life-and-death \r\nFight with the fiend. Whichever one death fells 440 Must deem it a just judgment by God. \r\nIf Grendel wins, it will be a gruesome day; \r\nHe will glut himself on the Geats in the war-hall, Swoop without fear on that flower of manhood \r\nAs on others before. Then my face won\xe2\x80\x99t be there To be covered in death; he will carry me away \r\nAs he goes to ground, gorged and bloodied; \r\nHe will run gloating with my raw corpse \r\nAnd feed on it alone, in a cruel frenzy, \r\nFouling his moor-nest. No need then 450 To lament for long or lay out my body: \r\nIf the battle takes me, send back \r\nThis breast-webbing that Weland fashioned \r\nAnd Hrethel gave me, to Hygelac. \r\nFate goes ever as fate must.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nHrothgar, the helmet of the Shieldings, spoke: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeowulf, my friend, you have traveled here \r\nTo favour us with help and fight for us. \r\nThere was a feud one time, begun by your father. With his own hands he had killed Heatholaf, 460\r\nWho was a Wulfing; so war was looming \r\nAnd his people, in fear of it, forced him to leave. He came away then over rolling waves \r\nTo the South Danes here, the sons of honor. \r\nI was then in the full flush of kingship, \r\nEstablishing my sway over all the rich strongholds Of this heroic land. Heorogar, \r\nMy older brother and the better man, \r\nAlso a son of Halfdane\xe2\x80\x99s, had died. \r\nFinally I healed the feud by paying: 470 I shipped a treasure-trove to the Wulfings \r\nAnd Ecgtheow acknowledged me with oaths of allegiance. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt bothers me to have to burden anyone \r\nWith all the grief Grendel has caused \r\nAnd the havoc he has wreaked upon us in Heorot, Our humiliations. My household-guard \r\nAre on the wane, fate sweeps them away \r\nInto Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s clutches---but God can easily \r\nHalt these raids and harrowing attacks! \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime and again, when the goblets passed 480 And seasoned fighters got flushed with beer \r\nThey would pledge themselves to protect Heorot And wait for Grendel with whetted swords. \r\nBut when dawn broke and day crept in \r\nOver each empty, blood-spattered bench, \r\nThe floor of the mead-hall where they had feasted Would be slick with slaughter. And so they died, Faithful retainers, and my following dwindled. Now take your place at the table, relish \r\nThe triumph of heroes to your heart\xe2\x80\x99s content.\xe2\x80\x9d 490 \r\nThen a bench was cleared in that banquet hall \r\nSo the Geats could have room to be together\r\nAnd the party sat, proud in their bearing, \r\nStrong and stalwart. An attendant stood by \r\nWith a decorated pitcher, pouring bright \r\nHelpings of mead. And the minstrel sang, \r\nFilling Heorot with his head-clearing voice, \r\nGladdening that great rally of Danes and Geats. \r\nFrom where he crouched at the king\xe2\x80\x99s feet, \r\nUnferth, a son of Ecglaf\xe2\x80\x99s, spoke 500 Contrary words. Beowulf\xe2\x80\x99s coming, \r\nHis sea-braving, made him sick with envy: \r\nHe could not brook or abide the fact \r\nThat anyone else alive under heaven \r\nMight enjoy greater regard than he did: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you the Beowulf who took on Breca \r\nIn a swimming match on the open sea, \r\nRisking the water just to prove you could win? \r\nIt was sheer vanity made you venture out \r\nOn the main deep. And no matter who tried, 510 Friend or foe, to deflect the pair of you, \r\nNeither would back down: the sea-test obsessed you. You waded in, embracing water, \r\nTaking its measure, mastering currents, \r\nRiding on the swell. The ocean swayed, \r\nWinter went wild in the waves, but you vied \r\nFor seven nights; and then he outswam you, \r\nCame ashore the stronger contender. \r\nHe was cast up safe and sound one morning \r\nAmong the Heathoreams, then made his way 520 To where he belonged in Bronding country, \r\nHome again, sure of his ground \r\nIn strong room and bawn. So Breca made good \r\nHis boast upon you and was proved right. \r\nNo matter, therefore, how you may have fared \r\nIn every bout and battle until now,\r\nThis time you\xe2\x80\x99ll be worsted; no one has ever \r\nOutlasted an entire night against Grendel.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nBeowulf, Ecgtheow\xe2\x80\x99s son, replied: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, friend Unferth, you have had your say 530 About Breca and me. But it was mostly beer \r\nThat was doing the talking. The truth is this: \r\nWhen the going was heavy in those high waves, I was the strongest swimmer of all. \r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99d been children together and we grew up \r\nDaring ourselves to outdo each other, \r\nBoasting and urging each other to risk \r\nOur lives on the sea. And so it turned out. \r\nEach of us swam holding a sword, \r\nA naked, hard-proofed blade for protection 540 Against the whale-beasts. But Breca could never Move out farther or faster from me \r\nThan I could manage to move from him. \r\nShoulder to shoulder, we struggled on \r\nFor five nights, until the long flow \r\nAnd pitch of the waves, the perishing cold, \r\nNight falling and winds from the North \r\nDrove us apart. The deep boiled up \r\nAnd its wallowing sent the sea-brutes wild. \r\nMy armor held me to hold out; 550 My hard-ringed chain-mail, hand-forged and linked, A fine, close-fitting filigree of gold, \r\nKept me safe when some ocean creature \r\nPulled me to the bottom. Pinioned fast \r\nAnd swathed in its grip, I was granted one \r\nFinal chance: my sword plunged \r\nAnd the ordeal was over. Through my own hands The fury of battle had finished off the sea-beast. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime and again, foul things attacked me,\r\nLurking and stalking, but I lashed out, 560 Gave as good as I got with my sword. \r\nMy flesh was not for feasting on, \r\nThere would be no monsters gnawing and gloating Over their banquet at the bottom of the sea. Instead, in the morning, mangled and sleeping The sleep of the sword, they slopped and floated Like the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s leavings. From now on \r\nSailors would the safe, the deep-sea raids \r\nWere over for good. Light came from the East, Bright guarantee of God, and the waves 570 Went quiet; I could see the headlands \r\nAnd buffeted cliffs. Often, for undaunted courage, Fate spares the man it has not already marked. However it had occurred, my sword had killed  Nine sea monsters. Such night-dangers \r\nAnd hard ordeals I have never heard of \r\nNor of a man so desolate in surging waves. But worn out as I was, I survived, \r\nCame through with my life. The ocean lifted And laid me ashore, I landed safe 580 On the coast of Finland. \r\n Now, I cannot recall \r\nany fight you entered, Unferth, \r\nThat bears comparison. I don\xe2\x80\x99t boast when I say That neither you nor Breca ever were much Celebrated for swordsmanship \r\nOr for facing danger in the battlefield. \r\nYou killed your own kith and kin, \r\nSo for all your cleverness and quick tongue, You will suffer damnation in the pits of hell. The fact it, Unferth, if you were truly 590 As keen or courageous as you claim to be \r\nGrendel would never have got away with \r\nSuch unchecked atrocity, attacks on your king,\r\nHavoc in Heorot and horrors everywhere. \r\nBut he knows he need never be in dread \r\nOf your blade making a mizzle of his blood \r\nOr of vengeance arriving ever from this quarter--- From the Victory-Shieldings, the shoulderers of the spear. He knows he can trample down you Danes \r\nTo his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content, humiliate and murder 600 Without fear of reprisal. But he will find me different. I will show him how Geats shape to kill \r\nIn the heat of battle. Then whoever wants to \r\nMay go bravely to morning mead, when morning light, Scarfed in sun-dazzle, shines forth from the south And brings another daybreak to the world.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nThen the gray-haired treasure-giver was glad; \r\nFar-famed in battle, the prince of Bright-Danes \r\nAnd keeper of his people counted on Beowulf, \r\nOn the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s steadfastness and his word. 610 So the laughter started, the din got louder \r\nAnd the crowd was happy. Wealhtheow came in, Hrothgar\xe2\x80\x99s queen, observing the courtesies. \r\nAdorned in her gold, she graciously saluted \r\nThe men in the hall, then handed the cup \r\nFirst to Hrothgar, their homeland\xe2\x80\x99s guardian, \r\nUrging him to drink deep and enjoy it, \r\nBecause he was dear to them. And he drank it down Like the warlord he was, with festive cheer. \r\nSo the Helming woman went on her rounds, 620 Queenly and dignified, decked out in rings, \r\nOffering the goblet to all ranks, \r\nTreating the household and the assembled troop Until it was Beowulf\xe2\x80\x99s turn to take it from her hand. With measured words she welcomed the Geat \r\nAnd thanked God for granting her wish \r\nThat a deliverer she could believe in would arrive\r\nTo ease their afflictions. He accepted the cup, \r\nA daunting man, dangerous in action \r\nAnd eager for it always. He addressed Wealhtheow; 630 Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, said: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a fixed purpose when I put out to sea.  \r\nAs I sat in the boat with my band of men, \r\nI meant to perform to the uttermost \r\nWhat your people wanted or perish in the attempt, In the fiend\xe2\x80\x99s clutches. And I shall fulfill that purpose, Prove myself with a proud deed \r\nOr meet my death here in the mead-hall.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nThis formal boast by Beowulf the Geat \r\nPleased the lady well and she went to sit 640 By Hrothgar, regal and arrayed with gold. \r\nThen it was like old times in the echoing hall, \r\nProud talk and the people happy, \r\nLoud and excited; until soon enough \r\nHalfdane\xe2\x80\x99s heir had to be away \r\nTo his night\xe2\x80\x99s rest. He realized \r\nThat the demon was going to descend on the hall \r\nThat he had plotted all day, from dawn-light \r\nUntil darkness gathered again over the world \r\nAnd stealthy night-shades came stealing forth 650 Under the cloud-murk. The company stood \r\nAs the two leaders took leave of each other: \r\nHrothgar wished Beowulf health and good luck, \r\nNamed him hall-warden and announced as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cNever, since my hand could hold a shield \r\nHave I entrusted or given control \r\nOf the Dane\xe2\x80\x99s hall to anyone but you. \r\nWard and guard it, for it is the greatest of houses. Be on your mettle now, keep in mind your fame,\r\nBeware of the enemy. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you wish for 660 That won\xe2\x80\x99t be yours if you win through alive.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nHrothgar departed then with his house-guard. \r\nThe lord of the Shieldings, their shelter in war, \r\nLeft the mead-hall to lie with Wealhtheow, \r\nHis queen and bedmate. The King of Glory \r\n(as people learned) had posted a lookout \r\nWho was a match for Grendel, a guard against monsters, Special protection to the Danish prince. \r\nAnd the Geat placed complete trust \r\nIn his strength of limb and the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s favor. 670 He began to remove his iron breast-mail, \r\nTook off the helmet and handed his attendant \r\nThe patterned sword, a smith\xe2\x80\x99s masterpiece, \r\nOrdering him to keep the equipment guarded. \r\nAnd before he bedded down, Beowulf, \r\nThat prince of goodness, proudly asserted: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes to fighting, I count myself \r\nAs dangerous any day as Grendel. \r\nSo it won\xe2\x80\x99t be a cutting edge I\xe2\x80\x99ll wield \r\nTo mow him down, easily as I might. 680 He has no ideas of the arts of war, \r\nOf shield or sword-play, though he does possess \r\nA wild strength. No weapons, therefore, \r\nFor either this night: unarmed he shall face me \r\nIf face me he dares. And may the Divine Lord \r\nIn His wisdom grant victory \r\nTo whichever side He sees fit.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nThen down the brave man lay with his bolster \r\nUnder his head and his whole company \r\nOf sea-rovers at rest beside him. 690 None of them expected he would ever see \r\nHis homeland again or get back\r\nTo his native place and the people who reared him. They knew too well the way it was before, \r\nHow often the Danes had fallen prey \r\nTo death in the mead-hall. But the Lord was weaving A victory on his war-loom for the Weather-Geats. Through the strength of one they all prevailed; They would crush their enemy and come through In triumph and gladness. The truth is clear: 700 Almighty God rules over mankind \r\nAnd always has. \r\n Then out of the night \r\nCame the shadow-stalker, stealthy and swift; \r\nThe hall-guards were slack, asleep at their posts, All except one; it was widely understood \r\nThat as long as God disallowed it, \r\nThe fiend could not bear them to his shadow-bourne. One man, however, was in a fighting mood, \r\nAwake and on edge, spoiling for action. \r\nIn off the moors, down through the mist-bands 710 God-cursed Grendel came greedily loping. \r\nThe bane of the race of men roamed forth, \r\nHunting for a prey in the high hall. \r\nUnder the cloud-murk he moved towards it \r\nUntil it shone above him, a sheer keep \r\nOf fortified gold. Nor was that the first time \r\nHe had scouted the grounds of Hrothgar\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling--- Although never in his life, before or since, \r\nDid he find harder fortune or hall-defenders. \r\nSpurned and joyless, he journeyed on ahead 720 And arrived at the bawn. The iron-braced door Turned in its hinge when his hand touched it. \r\nThen his rage boiled over, he ripped open \r\nThe mouth of the building, maddening for blood, Pacing the length of the patterned floor\r\nWith his loathsome tread, while a baleful light, Flame more than light, flared from his eyes. \r\nHe saw many men in the mansion, sleeping, \r\nA ranked company of kinsmen and warriors \r\nQuartered together. And his glee was demonic, 730 Picturing the mayhem: before morning \r\nHe would rip life from limp and devour them, \r\nFeed on their flesh: but his fate that night \r\nWas due to change, his days of ravening \r\nHad come to an end. \r\n Mighty and canny, \r\nHygelac\xe2\x80\x99s kinsman was keenly watching \r\nFor the first move the monster would make. \r\nNor did the creature keep him waiting \r\nBut struck suddenly and started in; \r\nHe grabbed and mauled a man on his bench, 740 Bit into his bone-lappings, bolted down his blood And gorged on him in lumps, leaving the body \r\nUtterly lifeless, eaten up \r\nHand and foot. Venturing closer, \r\nhis talon was raised to attack Beowulf \r\nWhere he lay on the bed; he was bearing in \r\nWith open claw when the alert hero\xe2\x80\x99s \r\nComeback and armlock forestalled him utterly. The captain of evil discovered himself \r\nIn a handgrip harder than anything 750 He had ever encountered in any man \r\nOn the face of the earth. Every bone in his body Quailed and coiled, but he could not escape.  \r\nHe was desperate to flee to his den and hide \r\nWith the devil\xe2\x80\x99s litter, for in all his days \r\nHe had never been clamped or cornered like this. Then Hygelac\xe2\x80\x99s trusty retainer recalled \r\nHis bedtime speech, sprang to his feet \r\nAnd got a firm hold. Fingers were bursting,\r\nThe monster back-tracking, the man overpowering. 760 The dread of the land was desperate to escape, \r\nTo take a roundabout road and flee \r\nTo his lair in the fens. The latching power \r\nIn his fingers weakened; it was the worst trip \r\nThe terror-monger had taken to Heorot. \r\nAnd now the timber trembled and sang, \r\nA hall-session that harrowed every Dane \r\nInside the stockade: stumbling in fury, \r\nThe two contenders crashed through the building. The hall clattered and hammered, but somehow 770 Survived the onslaught and kept standing: \r\nIt was handsomely structured, a sturdy frame \r\nBraced with the best of blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s work \r\nInside and out. The story goes \r\nThat as the pair struggled, mead benches were smashed And sprung off the floor, gold fittings and all. \r\nBefore then, no Shielding elder would believe \r\nThere was any power or person on earth \r\nCapable of wrecking their horn-rigged hall \r\nUnless the burning embrace of fire 780 Engulf it in flame. Then an extraordinary \r\nWail arose, and bewildering fear \r\nCame over the Danes. Everyone felt it \r\nWho heard that cry as it echoed off the wall, \r\nA God-cursed scream and strain of catastrophe, \r\nThe howl of the loser, the lament of the hell-serf \r\nKeening his wound. He was overwhelmed, \r\nManacled tight by the man who of all men \r\nWas foremost and strongest in the days of this life. \r\nBut the earl troop\xe2\x80\x99s leader was not inclined 790 To allow his caller to depart alive: \r\nHe did not consider that life of much account \r\nTo anyone anywhere. Time and again,\r\nBeowulf\xe2\x80\x99s warriors worked to defend \r\nTheir lord\xe2\x80\x99s life, laying about them \r\nAs best they could with their ancestral blades. \r\nStalwart in action, they kept striking out \r\nOn every side, seeking to cut \r\nStraight to the soul. When they joined the struggle \r\nThere was something they could have not known at the time, 800 That not blade on earth, no blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s art \r\nCould ever damage their demon opponent. \r\nHe had conjured the harm from the cutting edge \r\nOf every weapon. But his going away \r\nOut of the world and the days of his life \r\nWould be agony to him, and his alien spirit \r\nwould travel far into fiends\xe2\x80\x99 keeping. \r\nThen he who had harrowed the hearts of men \r\nWith pain and affliction in former times \r\nAnd had given offense also to God 810 Found that his bodily powers had failed him. \r\nHygelac\xe2\x80\x99s kinsman kept him helplessly \r\nLocked in a handgrip. As long as either lived \r\nHe was hateful to the other. The monster\xe2\x80\x99s whole \r\nBody was in pain, a tremendous wound \r\nAppeared on his shoulder. Sinews split \r\nAnd the bone-lappings burst. Beowulf was granted The glory of winning; Grendel was driven \r\nUnder the fen banks, fatally hurt, \r\nTo his desolate lair. His days were numbered, 820 The end of his life was coming over him, \r\nHe knew it for certain; and one bloody clash \r\nHad fulfilled the dearest wishes of the Danes. \r\nThe man who had lately landed among them, \r\nProud and sure, had purged the hall, \r\nKept it from harm; he was happy with his night-work And the courage he had shown. The Geat captain\r\nHad boldly fulfilled his boast to the Danes: \r\nHe had healed and relieved a huge distress, \r\nUnremitting humiliations, 830 The hard fate they\xe2\x80\x99d been forced to undergo, \r\nNo small affliction. Clear proof of this \r\nCould be seen in the hand the hero displayed \r\nHigh up near the roof: the whole of Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s Shoulder and arm, his awesome grasp. \r\nThen morning came and many a warrior \r\nGathered, as I have heard, around the gift-hall, Clan-chiefs flocking from far and near \r\nDown wide-ranging roads, wondering greatly At the monster\xe2\x80\x99s footprint. His fatal departure 840 Was regretted by no one who witnessed his trail, The ignominious marks of his flight \r\nWhere he\xe2\x80\x99d sulked away, exhausted in spirit \r\nAnd beaten in battle, bloodying the path, \r\nHauling his doom to the demons\xe2\x80\x99 mere. \r\nThe bloodshot water wallowed and surged, \r\nThere were loathsome up throws and over turnings Of waves and gore and would-slurry. \r\nWith his death upon him, he had dived deep \r\nInto his marsh den, drowned out his life 850 And his heathen soul: hell claimed him there. \r\nThen away they rode, the old retainers \r\nWith many a young man following after, \r\nA troop on horseback, in high spirits \r\nOn their bay steeds. Beowulf\xe2\x80\x99s doings \r\nWere praised over and over again. \r\nNowhere, they said, north or south \r\nBetween the two seas or under the tall sky \r\nOn the broad earth was there anyone better \r\nTo raise a shield or to rule a kingdom. 860\r\nYet there was no laying of blame on their lord, The noble Hrothgar; he was a good king. \r\nAt times the war-band broke into a gallop, \r\nLetting their chestnut horses race \r\nWherever they found the going good \r\nOn those well-known tracks. Meanwhile, a thane Of the king\xe2\x80\x99s household, a carrier of tales, \r\nA traditional singer deeply schooled \r\nIn the lore of the past, linked a new theme \r\nTo a strict metre. The man started 870 To recite with skill, rehearsing Beowulf\xe2\x80\x99s \r\nTriumphs and feats in well-fashioned lines, \r\nEntwining his words. \r\n He told what he\xe2\x80\x99d heard Repeated in songs of Sigemund\xe2\x80\x99s exploits, \r\nAll of those many feats and marvels, \r\nThe struggles and wanderings of Wael\xe2\x80\x99s son, Things unknown to anyone, \r\nExcept Fitela, feuds and foul doings \r\nConfided from uncle to nephew when he felt The urge to speak of them: always had they been 880 Partners in the fight, friends in need. \r\nThey killed giants, their conquering swords \r\nHad brought them down. \r\n After his death \r\nSigemund\xe2\x80\x99s glory grew and grew \r\nBecause of his courage when he killed the dragon, The guardian of the hoard. Under gray stone He had dared to enter all by himself  \r\nTo face the worst without Fitela. \r\nBut nit came to pass that his sword plunged Right through those radiant scales 890 And drove into the wall. The dragon died of it.\r\nHis daring had given him total possession \r\nOf the treasure hoard , his to dispose of \r\nHowever he liked. He loaded a boat: \r\nWael\xe2\x80\x99s son weighted her hold \r\nWith dazzling spoils. The hot dragon melted. \r\nSigemund\xe2\x80\x99s name was known everywhere. \r\nHe was utterly valiant and venturesome, \r\nA fence round his fighters and flourished therefore  After King Heremond\xe2\x80\x99s prowess declined 900 And his campaigns slowed down. The king was betrayed, Ambushed in Jutland, overpowered \r\nAnd done away with. The waves of his grief Had beaten him down, made him a burden, \r\nA source of anxiety to his own nobles: \r\nThat expedition was often condemned \r\nTo those earlier times by experienced men, \r\nMen who relied on his lordship for redress, \r\nWho presumed that the part of a prince was to thrive On his father\xe2\x80\x99s throne and protect the nation, 910 The Shielding land where they lived and belonged, Its holdings and strongholds. Such was Beowulf In the affection of his friends and of everyone alive. But evil entered into Heremod. \r\nMeanwhile, the Dane kept racing their mounts Down sandy lanes. The light of day \r\nBroke and kept brightening. Bands of retainers Galloped in excitement to the gabled hall \r\nTo see the marvel; and the king himself, \r\nGuardian of the ring-hoard, goodness in person, 920 Walked in majesty from the women\xe2\x80\x99s quarters With a numerous train, attended by his queen \r\nAnd her crowd of maidens, across the mead-hall.\r\nWhen Hrothgar arrived at the hall, he spoke, \r\nStanding on the steps, under the steep eaves, \r\nGazing at the roofwork and Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s talon: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst and foremost, let the Almighty Father \r\nBe thanked for this sight. I suffered a long \r\nHarrowing by Grendel. But the Heavenly Shepherd Can work his wonders always and everywhere. 930 Not long since, it seemed I would never \r\nBe granted the slightest solace or relief \r\nFrom any of my burdens: the best of houses \r\nGlittered and reeked and ran with blood. \r\nThis one worry outweighed all others--- \r\nA constant distress to counselors entrusted \r\nWith defending the people\xe2\x80\x99s forts from assault By monsters and demons. But now a man, \r\nWith the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, has accomplished something None of us could manage before now 940 For all our efforts. Whoever she was \r\nWho brought forth this flower of manhood, \r\nIf she is still alive, that woman can say \r\nThat in her labor the Lord of Ages \r\nBestowed a grace on her. So now, Beowulf, \r\nadopt you in my heart as a dear son. \r\nNourish and maintain this new connection, \r\nYou noblest of men; there\xe2\x80\x99ll be nothing you want for, No worldly good that won\xe2\x80\x99t be yours. \r\nI have often honored smaller achievements, 950 Recognized warriors not nearly as worthy, \r\nLavished rewards on the less deserving. \r\nBut you have made yourself immortal \r\nBy your glorious action. May the Lord of Ages Continue to keep and requite you well.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nBeowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have gone through a glorious endeavor\r\nAnd been much favored in this fight we dared Against the unknown. Nevertheless, \r\nIf you could have seen the monster himself 960 Where he lay beaten, I would have been better pleased. My plan was to pounce, pin him down \r\nIn a tight grip and grapple him to death--- \r\nHave him panting for life, powerless and clasped In my bare hands, his body in thrall. \r\nBut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop him from slipping my hold. The Lord allowed it, my lock on him \r\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t strong enough, he struggled fiercely \r\nAnd broke and ran. Yet he bought his freedom At a high price, for he left his hand 970 And arm and shoulder to show he had been here, A cold comfort for having come among us. \r\nAnd now he won\xe2\x80\x99t be long for this world. \r\nHe has done his worst but the wound will end him. He is hasped and hooped and hirpling with pain, Limped and looped in it. Like a man outlawed For wickedness, he mush await \r\nThe mighty judgment of God in majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d  \r\nThere was less tampering and big talk then \r\nFrom Unferth the boaster, less of his blather 980 As the hall-thanes eyed the awful proof \r\nOf the hero\xe2\x80\x99s prowess, the splayed hand \r\nUp under the eaves. Every nail, \r\nClaw-scale and spur, every spike \r\nAnd welt on the hand of that heathen brute \r\nWas like barbed steel. Everybody said \r\nThere was no honed iron hard enough \r\nTo pierce him through, no time-proofed blade That could cut his brutal, blood-caked claw. \r\nThen the order was given for all hands 990\r\nTo help refurbish Heorot immediately: \r\nMen and women thronging the wine-hall, \r\nGetting it ready. Gold thread shone \r\nIn the wall-hangings, woven scenes \r\nThat attracted and held the eye\xe2\x80\x99s attention. \r\nBut iron-braced as the inside of it had been, \r\nThe bright room lay in ruins now. \r\nThe very doors had been dragged from their hinges. Only the roof remained unscathed \r\nBy the time the guilt-fouled fiend turned tail 1000 In despair of his life. But death is not easily \r\nEscaped from by anyone: \r\nAll of us with souls, earth-dwellers \r\nAnd children of men, must make our way \r\nTo a destination already ordained \r\nWhere the body, after the banqueting, \r\nSleeps on its deathbed.  \r\n Then the due time arrived \r\nFor Halfdane\xe2\x80\x99s son to proceed to the hall. \r\nThe king himself would sit down to feast. \r\nNo group ever gathered in greater numbers 1010 Or better order around their ring-giver. \r\nThe benches filled with famous men \r\nWho fell to with relish; round upon round \r\nOf mead was passed; those powerful kinsmen, \r\nHrothgar and Hrothulf, were in high spirits \r\nIn the raftered hall. Inside Heorot \r\nThere was nothing but friendship. The Shielding nation Was not yet familiar with feud and betrayal. \r\nThen Halfdane\xe2\x80\x99s son presented Beowulf \r\nWith gold standards as a victory gift, 1020 An embroidered banner; also breast-mail \r\nAnd a helmet; and a sword carried high, \r\nThat was both precious object and a token of honor. So Beowulf drank his drink, at ease;\r\nIt was hardly a shame to be showered with such gifts In front of the hall-troops. There haven\xe2\x80\x99t been many Moments, I am sure, when men have exchanged \r\nFour such treasures at so friendly a sitting. \r\nAn embossed ring, a band lapped with wire \r\nArched over the helmet: head-protection 1030 To keep the keen-ground cutting edge \r\nFrom damaging it when danger threatened \r\nAnd the man was battling behind his shield. \r\nNext the king ordered eight horses \r\nWith gold bridles to be brought through the yard \r\nInto the hall. The harness of one \r\nIncluded a saddle of sumptuous design, \r\nThe battle-seat where the son of Halfdane \r\nRode when he wished to join the sword-play: \r\nWherever the killing and carnage were the worst, 1040 He would be to the fore, fighting hard. \r\nThe Danish prince, descendent of Ing, \r\nHanded over both the arms and the horses, \r\nUrging Beowulf to use them well. \r\nAnd so their leader, the lord and guard \r\nOf coffer and strong room, with customary grace \r\nBestowed upon Beowulf both sets of gifts. \r\nA fair witness can see how well each one behaved.  \r\nThe chieftain went on to reward the others: \r\nEach man on the bench who had sailed with Beowulf 1050 And risked the voyage received a bounty, \r\nSome treasured possession. And compensation, \r\nA price in gold, was settled for the Geat \r\nGrendel had killed cruelly earlier-- \r\nAs he would have killed more, had not mindful God And one man\xe2\x80\x99s daring prevented that doom. \r\nPast and present, God\xe2\x80\x99s will prevails. \r\nHence, understanding is always best\r\nAnd a prudent mind. Whoever remains \r\nFor long here in this earthly life 1060 Will enjoy and endure more than enough. \r\nThey sang then and played to please the hero, Words and music for their warrior prince, \r\nHarp tunes and tales of adventure: \r\nThere were high times on the hall benches And the king\xe2\x80\x99s poet performed his part \r\nWith the saga of Finn and his sons, unfolding The tale of the fierce attack in Friesland \r\nWhere Hnaef, king of the Danes, met death. \r\nHildeburh 1070   Had little cause \r\nTo credit the Jutes: \r\n Son and brother, \r\nShe lost them both \r\n On the battlefield. \r\nShe, bereft \r\n And blameless, they \r\nForedoomed, cut down \r\n And spear-gored. She, \r\nThe woman in shock, \r\n Waylaid by grief, \r\nHoc\xe2\x80\x99s daughter-- \r\n How could she not \r\nLament her fate \r\n When morning came \r\nAnd the light broke  \r\n On her murdered dears? \r\nAnd so farewell \r\n Delight on earth, \r\nWar carried away 1080  Finn\xe2\x80\x99s troop of thanes,\r\nAll but a few. \r\n How then could Finn  \r\nHold the line \r\n Or fight on \r\nTo the end with Hengest, \r\n How save \r\nThe rump of his force \r\n From that enemy chief? \r\nSo a truce was offered \r\n As follows: first \r\nSeparate quarters \r\n To be cleared for the Danes, Hall and throne \r\n To be shared with the Frisians. Then, second ; \r\n Every day  \r\nAt the dole-out of gifts \r\n  \r\n Finn, son of Focwald, \r\nShould honor the Danes, 1090  Bestow with an even  \r\nHand to Hengest \r\n And Hengest\xe2\x80\x99s men \r\nThe wrought-gold rings, \r\n Bounty to match \r\nThe measure he gave \r\n His own Frisians-- \r\nTo keep morale \r\n In the beer-hall high. \r\nBoth sides then \r\n Sealed their agreement. \r\nWith oaths to Hengest \r\n Finn swore \r\nOpenly, solemnly, \r\n That the battle survivors\r\nWould be guaranteed \r\n Honor and status. \r\nNo infringement \r\n By word or deed, \r\nNo provocation 1100  Would be permitted. \r\nTheir own ring-giver \r\n After all \r\nWas dead and gone, \r\n They were leaderless \r\nIn forced allegiance \r\n To his murderer. \r\nSo if any Frisian \r\n Stirred up bad blood \r\nWith insinuations \r\n Or taunts about this, \r\nThe blade of the sword \r\n Will arbitrate it. \r\nA funeral pyre \r\n Was then prepared, \r\nEffulgent gold \r\n Brought out from the hoard. The pride and prince \r\n Of the Shieldings lay \r\nAwaiting the flame. 1110  Everywhere \r\nThere were blood-plastered \r\n Coats of mail. \r\nThe pyre was heaped \r\n With boar-shaped helmets Forged in gold, \r\n With the gashed corpses \r\nOf well-born Danes-- \r\n Many had fallen. \r\nThen Hildeburh\r\n Ordered her own \r\nSon\xe2\x80\x99s body \r\n Be burnt with Hnaef\xe2\x80\x99s, \r\nThe flesh on his bones \r\n To sputter and blaze \r\nBeside his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s. \r\n The woman wailed \r\nAnd sang keens, \r\n The warrior went up. \r\nCarcass flame 1120  Swirled and fumed, \r\nThey stood round the burial \r\n Mound and howled \r\nAs heads melted, \r\n Crusted gashes \r\nSpattered and ran \r\n Bloody matter. \r\nThe glutton element \r\n Flamed and consumed \r\nThe dead of both sides. \r\n Their great days were gone. \r\nWarriors scattered \r\n To homes and forts \r\nAll over Friesland, \r\n Fewer now, feeling \r\nLoss of friends. \r\n Hengest stayed, \r\nLived out that whole \r\n Resentful, blood-sullen \r\nWinter with Finn, 1130  Homesick and helpless. \r\nNo ring-whorled prow \r\n Could up then \r\nAnd away on the sea. \r\n Wind and water\r\nRaged with storms, \r\n Wave and shingle \r\nWere shackled on ice \r\n Until another year \r\nAppeared in the yard \r\n As it does to this day, \r\nThe seasons constant, \r\n The wonder of light \r\nComing over us. \r\n Then winter was gone, \r\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s lap grew lovely, \r\n Longing woke \r\nIn the cooped-up exile \r\n For a voyage home-- \r\nBut more for vengeance, 1140  Some way of bringing \r\nThings to a head: \r\n His sword arm hankered \r\nTo greet the Jutes. \r\n So he did not balk \r\nOnce Hunlafing  \r\n Placed on his lap \r\nDazle-the -Duel, \r\n The best sword of all, \r\nWhose edges Jutes \r\n Knew only too well. \r\nThus blood was spilled, \r\n The gallant Finn \r\nSlain in his home \r\n After Guthlaf and Oslaf \r\nBack from their voyage \r\n Made old accusation: \r\nThe brutal ambush, \r\n The fate they had suffered, \r\nAll blamed on Finn. 1150\r\n The wildness in them \r\nHad to brim over. \r\n The hall ran red \r\nWith blood of enemies. \r\n Finn was cut down, \r\nThe queen brought away \r\n And everything \r\nThe Shieldings could find \r\n Inside Finn\xe2\x80\x99s walls-- \r\nThe Frisian king\xe2\x80\x99s \r\n Gold collars and gemstones-- \r\nSwept off to the ship. \r\n Over sea-lanes then \r\nBack to Daneland \r\n The warrior troop \r\nBore that lady home. \r\n The poem was over, \r\nThe poet had performed, a pleasant murmur \r\nStarted on the benches, stewards did the rounds 1160 With wine in splendid jugs, and Wilhtheow came to sit In her gold crown between two good men, \r\nUncle and nephew, each of whom \r\nStill trusted the other; and the forthright Unferth, Admired by all for his mind and courage \r\nAlthough under a cloud for killing his brothers, \r\nReclined near the king. \r\n The queen spoke: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnjoy this drink, my most generous lord; \r\nRaise up your goblet, entertain the Geats \r\nDuly and gently, discourse with them, 1170 Be open-handed, happy and fond. \r\nRelish their company, but recollect as well \r\nAll of the boons that have been bestowed upon you. The bright court of Heorot has been cleansed \r\nAnd now the word is that you want to adopt\r\nThis warrior as a son. So, while you may, \r\nBask in your fortune, then bequeath \r\nKingdom and nation to your kith and kin, \r\nBefore your decease. I am certain of Hrothulf. He is noble and will use the young ones well. 1180 He will not let you down. Should you die before him, He will treat our children truly and fairly. \r\nHe will honor, I am sure, our two sons, \r\nRepay them in kind when he recollects \r\nAll the good things we gave him once, \r\nThe favor and respect he found in childhood.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nShe turned then to the bench where her boys sat, Hrethric and Hrothmond, with other nobles\xe2\x80\x99 sons, All the youth together; and that good man, \r\nBeowulf the Geat, sat between the brothers. 1190 \r\nThe cup was carried to him, kind words \r\nSpoken in welcome and wealth of wrought gold Graciously bestowed; two arm bangles, \r\nA mail shirt and rings, and the most resplendent Torque of gold I have ever heard tell of \r\nAnywhere on earth or under heaven. \r\nThere was no hoard like it since Hama snatched The Brosings\xe2\x80\x99 neck-chain and bore it away \r\nWith its gems and settings to his shinning fort, Away from Eormenric\xe2\x80\x99s wiles and hatred, 1200 And thereby ensured his eternal reward. \r\nHygelac the Geat, grandson of Swerting, \r\nWore this neck-ring on his last raid; \r\nAt bay under his banner, he defended the booty,  Treasure he had won. Fate swept him away \r\nBecause of his proud need to provoke \r\nA feud with the Frisians. He fell beneath his shield, In the same gem-crusted , kingly gear\r\nHe had worn when he crossed the frothing wave-vat. So the dead king fell into Frankish hands. 1210 Hey took his breast-mail, also his neck-torque, \r\nAnd punier warriors plundered the slain \r\nWhen the carnage ended; Geat corpses \r\nCovered the field. \r\n Applause filled the hall. \r\nThen Wealhtheow pronounce in the presence of the company: \xe2\x80\x9cTake delight in this torque, dear Beowulf, \r\nWear it for luck and also wear this mail \r\nFrom our people\xe2\x80\x99s armory: may you prosper in them! Be acclaimed or strength, for kindly guidance \r\nTo these two boys, and your bounty will be sure. 1220 You have won renown: you are known to all men Far and near, now and forever. \r\nYour sway is wide and the wind\xe2\x80\x99s home, \r\nAs the sea around cliffs. So, my prince, \r\nI wish you a lifetime\xe2\x80\x99s luck and blessings \r\nTo enjoy this treasure. Treat my sons \r\nWith tender care, be strong and kind. \r\nHere each comrade is true to the other, \r\nLoyal to lord, loving in spirit. \r\nThe thanes have one purpose, the people are ready: 1230 Having drunk and pledged, the ranks do as I bid.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nShe moved then to her place. Men were drinking wine At that rare feast; how could they know fate, \r\nThe grim shape of things to come, \r\nThe threat looming over many thanes \r\nAs night approached and king Hrothgar prepared To retire to his quarters? Retainers in great numbers Were posted on guard as so often in the past. \r\nBenches were pushed back, bedding gear and bolsters Spread across the floor, and one man 1240\r\nLay down to his rest, already marked for death. \r\nAt their heads they placed their polished timber \r\nBattle-shields; and on the bench above them, \r\nEach man\xe2\x80\x99s kit was kept to hand: \r\nA towering war-helmet, webbed mail-shirt \r\nAnd great-shafted spear. It was their habit \r\nAlways and everywhere to be ready for action, \r\nAt home or in the camp, in whatever case \r\nAnd at whatever time the need arose \r\nTo rally round their lord. They were a right people. 1250 \r\nThey went to sleep. And one paid dearly \r\nFor his night\xe2\x80\x99s ease, as had happened to them often, Ever since Grendel occupied the gold-hall, \r\nCommitting evil until the end came, \r\nDeath after his crimes. Then it became clear, \r\nObvious to everyone once the fight was over, \r\nThat an avenger lurked and was still alive, \r\nGrimly biding time. Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s mother, \r\nMonstrous hell-bride, brooded on her wrongs. \r\nShe had been forced down into fearful waters, 1260 The cold depths, after Cain had killed \r\nHis father\xe2\x80\x99s son, felled his own \r\nBrother with the sword. Banished an outlaw, \r\nMarked by having murdered, he moved into the wilds, Shunning company and joy. And from Cain there sprang Misbegotten spirits, among them Grendel, \r\nThe banished and accursed, due to come to grips With that watcher in Heorot waiting to do battle. The monster wrenched and wrestled with him \r\nBu Beowulf was mindful of his mighty strength, 1270 The wondrous gifts God had showered on him: \r\nHe relied for help on the Lord of All, \r\nOn His care and favor. So he overcame the foe, Brought down the hell-brute. Broken and bowed,\r\nOutcast from all sweetness, the enemy of mankind Made for his death-den. But now his mother \r\nHad sallied forth on a savage journey, \r\nGrief-racked and ravenous, desperate for revenge. \r\nShe came to Heorot. There, inside the hall, \r\nDanes lay asleep, earls who would soon endure 1280 A great reversal once Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s mother \r\nAttacked and entered. Her onslaught was less \r\nOnly by as much as an Amazon warrior\xe2\x80\x99s \r\nIn less than an armored man\xe2\x80\x99s \r\nWhen the hefted sword, its hammered edge \r\nAnd gleaming blade slathered in blood, \r\nRazes the sturdy boar-ridge off a helmet. \r\nThen in the hall, hard-honed swords \r\nWere grabbed from the bench, many a broad shield Lifted and braced; there was little thought of helmets 1290 Or woven mail when they woke in terror. \r\nThe hell-dam was in panic, desperate to get out, \r\nIn mortal terror the moment she was found. \r\nShe had pounced and taken one of the retainers \r\nIn a tight hold, then headed for the fen. \r\nTo Hrothgar, this man was the most beloved \r\nOf the friends he trusted between the two seas. \r\nShe had done away with a great warrior, \r\nAmbushed him at rest. \r\n Beowulf was elsewhere. \r\nEarlier, after the reward of the treasure, 1300 The Geat had been given another lodging. \r\nThere was an uproar in Heorot. She had snatched their trophy, Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s bloodied hand. It was a fresh blow \r\nTo the afflicted bawn. The bargain was hard, \r\nBoth parties having to pay \r\nWith the lives of friends. And the old lord,\r\nThe gray-haired warrior, was heartsore and weary When he heard the news: his highest-placed advisor, His dearest companion, was dead and gone. \r\nBeowulf was quickly brought to the chamber: 1310 The winner of fights, the arch-warrior, \r\nCame first-footing in with his fellow troops \r\nTo where the king in his wisdom waited, \r\nStill wondering whether Almighty God \r\nWould even turn the tide of his misfortunes. \r\nSo Beowulf entered with his band in attendance \r\nAnd the wooden floor-boards banged and rang \r\nAs he advance, hurrying to address \r\nThe prince of the Ingwins, asking if he\xe2\x80\x99d rested \r\nSince the urgent summons had come as a surprise. 1320 \r\nThen Hrothgar, the Shieldings\xe2\x80\x99 helmet, spoke: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest? What is rest? Sorrow has returned. \r\nAlas for the Danes! Aeschere is dead. \r\nHe was Yrmenlaf\xe2\x80\x99s elder brother \r\nAnd a soul mate to me, a true mentor, \r\nMy right-hand man when the ranks clashed \r\nAnd our boar-crests had to take a battering \r\nIn the line of action. Aechere was everything \r\nThe world admires in a wise man and a friend. \r\nThen this roaming killer came in a fury 1330 And slaughtered him in Heorot. Where she is hiding, Glutting on the corpse and glorying in her escape, I cannot tell; she has taken up the feud \r\nBecause of last night, when you killed Grendel, \r\nWrestled and racked him in ruinous combat \r\nSince for too long he had terrorized us \r\nWith his depredations. He died in battle, \r\nPaid with his life; and now this powerful \r\nOther one arrives, this force for evil \r\nDriven to avenge her kinsman\xe2\x80\x99s death. 1340\r\nOr so it seems to thanes in their grief, \r\nIn the anguish every thane endures \r\nAt the loss of a ring-giver, now that the hand \r\nThat bestowed so richly has been stilled in death. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard it said by my people in hall, \r\nCounselors who live in the upland country, \r\nThat they have seen two such creatures \r\nProwling the moors, huge marauders \r\nFrom some other world. One of these things, \r\nAs far as anyone ever can discern, 1350 Looks like a woman; the other, warped \r\nIn the shape of a man, moves beyond the pale Bigger than any man, an unnatural birth \r\nCalled Grendel by country people \r\nIn former days. They are fatherless creatures, And their whole ancestry is hidden in a past \r\nOf demons and ghosts. They dwell apart \r\nAmong wolves on hills, on windswept crags \r\nAnd treacherous keshes, where cold streams \r\nPour down the mountain and disappear 1360 Under mist and moorland. \r\n A few miles from here \r\nA frost-stiffened wood waits and keeps watch Above a mere; the overhanging bank \r\nIs a maze of tree roots mirrored in its surface. \r\nAt night there, something uncanny happens: \r\nThe water burns. And the mere bottom \r\nHas never been sounded by the sons of men. \r\nOn its bank, the heather-stepper halts: \r\nThe hart in flight from pursuing hounds \r\nWill turn to face them with firm-set horns 1370 And die in the wood rather than dive \r\nBeneath its surface. That is no good place. \r\nWhen the wind blows up and stormy weather\r\nMakes clouds scud and the skies weep, \r\nOut of its depths a dirty surge \r\nIs pitched towards the heavens. Now help depends Again on you and you alone. \r\nThe gap of danger where the demon waits \r\nIs still unknown to you. Seek it if you dare. \r\nI will compensate you for settling the feud 1380 As I did last time with lavish wealth, \r\nCoffers of coiled gold, if you come back.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nBeowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWise sir, do not grieve. It is always better \r\nTo avenge dear ones than to indulge in mourning. For every one of us, living in this world \r\nMeans waiting for our end. Let whoever can \r\nWin glory before death. When a warrior is gone, That will be his best and only bulwark. \r\nSo arise, my lord, and let us immediately 1390 Set forth on the trail of this troll-dam. \r\nI guarantee you: she will not get away, \r\nNot to dens underground nor upland groves \r\nNor the ocean floor. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have nowhere to flee to. Endure your troubles today. Bear up \r\nAnd be the man I expect you to be.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nWith that the old lord sprung to his feet \r\nAnd praised God for Beowulf\xe2\x80\x99s pledge. \r\nThen a bit and halter were brought for his horse With the plaited mane. The wise king mounted 1400 The royal saddle and rode out in style \r\nWith a force of shield-bearers. The forest paths Were marked all over with the monster\xe2\x80\x99s tracks, Her trail on the ground wherever she had gone Across the dark moors, dragging away \r\nThe body of that thane, Hrothgar\xe2\x80\x99s best\r\nCounselor and overseer of the country. \r\nSo the noble prince proceeded undismayed \r\nUp fells and screes, along narrow footpaths \r\nAnd ways where they were forced into single file, 1410 Ledges on cliffs above lairs of water-monsters. \r\nHe went in front with a few men, \r\nGood judges of the lie of the land, \r\nAnd suddenly discovered the dismal wood, \r\nMountain trees growing out at an angle \r\nAbove gray stones: the bloodshot water \r\nSurged underneath. It was a sore blow \r\nTo all of the Danes, friends of the Shieldings, \r\nA hurt to each and every one \r\nOf that noble company when they came upon 1420 Aechere\xe2\x80\x99s head at the foot of the cliff. \r\nEverybody gazed as the hot gore \r\nKept wallowing up and an urgent war-horn \r\nRepeated its notes: the whole party \r\nSat down to watch. The water was infested \r\nWith all kinds of reptiles. There were writhing sea-dragons And monsters slouching on slopes by the cliff, \r\nSerpents and wild things such as those that often Surface at dawn to roam the sail-road \r\nAnd doom the voyage. Down they plunged, 1430 Lashing in anger at the loud call \r\nOf the battle bugle. An arrow from the bow \r\nOf the Geat chief got one of them \r\nAs he surged to the surface: the seasoned shaft \r\nStuck deep in his flank and his freedom in the water Got less and less. It was his last swim. \r\nHe was swiftly overwhelmed in the shallows, \r\nProdded by barbed boar-spears, \r\nCornered, beaten, pulled up on the bank, \r\nA strange lake-birth, a loathsome catch 1440\r\nMen gazed at in awe. \r\n Beowulf got ready, \r\nDonned his war-gear, indifferent to death; \r\nHis mighty, hand-forged, fine-webbed mail \r\nWould soon meet with the menace under water. \r\nIt would keep the bone-cage of his body safe: \r\nNo enemy\xe2\x80\x99s clasp could crush him in it, \r\nNo vicious arm lock choke his life out. \r\nTo guard his head he had a glittering helmet  \r\nThat was due to be muddied on the mere bottom And blurred in the up swirl. It was of beaten gold, 1450 Princely headgear hooped and hasped \r\nBy a weapon-smith who had worked wonders \r\nIn days gone by and adorned it with boar-shapes; Since then it had resisted every sword. \r\nAnd another item lent by Unferth \r\nAt that moment was of no small importance: \r\nThe brehon handed him a hilted weapon, \r\nA rare and ancient sword named Hrunting. \r\nThe iron blade with its ill-boding patterns \r\nHad been tempered in blood. It had never failed 1460 The hand of anyone who had hefted it in battle, \r\nAnyone who had fought and faced the worst \r\nIn the gap of danger. This was not the first time It had been called to perform heroic feats. \r\nWhen he lent that blade to the better swordsman, Unferth, the strong-built son of Ecglaf, \r\nCould hardly have remember the ranting speech He had made in his cups. He was not man enough To face the turmoil of a fight under water \r\nAnd the risk to his life. So there he lost 1470 fame and repute. It was different for the other \r\nRigged out in his gear, ready to do battle.\r\nBeowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke:  \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWisest of kings, now that I have come \r\nTo the point of action, I ask you to recall \r\nWhat we said earlier: that you, son of Halfdane \r\nAnd gold-friend to retainers, that you, if I should fall And suffer death while serving your cause, \r\nWould act like a father to me afterwards. \r\nIf this combat kills me, take care 1480 Of my young company, my comrades in arms. \r\nAnd be sure also, my beloved Hrothgar, \r\nTo send Hygelac the treasures I received. \r\nLet the lord of the Geats gaze on that gold, \r\nLet Hrethel\xe2\x80\x99s son take note of it and see \r\nThat I found a ring-giver of rare magnificence \r\nAnd enjoyed the good of his generosity. \r\nAnd Unferth is to have what I inherited: \r\nTo that far-famed man I bequeath my own \r\nSharp-horned, wave-sheened wonder blade. 1490 With Hrunting I shall gain glory or die. \r\nAfter these words, the prince of the Weather-Geats Was impatient to be away and plunged suddenly: Without more ado, he dived in to the heaving \r\nDepths of the lake. It was the best part of a day \r\nBefore he could see the solid bottom. \r\nQuickly the one who haunted those waters, \r\nWho had scavenged and gone her gluttonous rounds For a hundred seasons, sensed a human \r\nObserving her outlandish lair from above. 1500 So she lunged and clutched and managed to catch him In her brutal grip; but his body, for all that, \r\nRemained unscathed: the mesh of the chain-mail Saved him on the outside. Her savage talons \r\nFailed to rip the web of his war shirt. \r\nThen once she touched bottom, the wolfish swimmer\r\nCarried the ring-mailed prince to her court \r\nSo that for all his courage he could never use \r\nThe weapons he carried; and a bewildering horde Came at him from the depths, droves of sea-beasts 1510 Who attacked with tusks and tore at his chain-mail In a ghastly onslaught. The gallant man \r\nCould see he had entered some hellish turn-hole \r\nAnd yet the water did not work against him \r\nBecause the hall-roofing held off \r\nThe force of the current; then he saw firelight, \r\nA gleam and flare-up, a glimmer of brightness. \r\nThe hero observed that swamp-thing from hell, \r\nThe tarn-hag in all her terrible strength, \r\nThen heaved his war-sword and swung his arm: 1520 The decorated blade came down ringing \r\nAnd singing on her head. But he soon found \r\nHis battle-torch extinguished: the shinning blade \r\nRefused to bite. It spared her and failed \r\nThe man in his need. It had gone through many \r\nHand-to-hand fights, had hewed the armor \r\nAnd helmets of the doomed, but here at last \r\nThe fabulous powers of that heirloom failed. \r\nHygelac\xe2\x80\x99s kinsman kept thinking about \r\nHis name and fame: he never lost heart. 1530 Then, in fury, he flung his sword away. \r\nThe keen, inlaid, worm-looped-patterned steel \r\nWas hurled to the ground: he would have to rely \r\nOn the might of his arm. So must a man do \r\nWho intends to gain enduring glory \r\nIn a combat. Life doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cost him thought. \r\nThen the prince of War-Geats, warming to his fight With Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s mother, gripped her shoulder \r\nAnd laid about him in a battle frenzy: \r\nHe pitched his killer opponent to the floor 1540\r\nBut she rose quickly and retaliated, \r\nGrappled him tightly in her grim embrace. \r\nThe sure-footed fight fell daunted, \r\nThe strongest of warriors stumbled and fell. \r\nSo she pounced upon him and pulled out \r\nA broad, whetted knife: now she could avenge Her only child. But the mesh of chain-mail \r\nOn Beowulf\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder shielded his life, \r\nTurned the edge and tip of the blade. \r\nThe son of Ecgtheow would surely have perished 1550 And the Geats lost their warrior under the wide earth Had the strong links and locks of his war-gear Not helped to save him: Holy God \r\nDecided the victory. It was easy for the Lord, \r\nThe Ruler of Heaven, to redress the balance \r\nOnce Beowulf got back up on his feet. \r\nThen he saw a blade that boded well, \r\nA sword in her armory, an ancient heirloom \r\nFrom the days of the giants, an ideal weapon, \r\nOne that any warrior would envy, 1560 But so huge and heavy in itself \r\nOnly Beowulf could wield it in battle. \r\nSo the Shieldings\xe2\x80\x99 hero, hard-pressed and enraged, Took a firm hold of the hilt and swung \r\nThe blade in an arc, a resolute blow \r\nThat bit into her neck bone \r\nAnd severed it entirely, toppling the doomed \r\nHouse of her flesh; she fell to the floor. \r\nThe sword dripped blood, the swordsman was elated. \r\nA light appeared and the place brightened 1570 The way the sky does when heaven\xe2\x80\x99s candle \r\nIs shinning clearly. He inspected the vault: \r\nWith sword held high, its hilt raised\r\nTo guard and threaten, Hygelac\xe2\x80\x99s thane \r\nScouted by the wall in Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s wake. \r\nNow the weapon was to prove its worth. \r\nThe warrior determined to take revenge \r\nFor every gross act Grendel had committed-- \r\nAnd not only for that one occasion \r\nWhen he\xe2\x80\x99d come to slaughter the sleeping troops, 1580 Fifteen of Hrothgar\xe2\x80\x99s house-guards \r\nSurprised on their benches and ruthlessly devoured, And as many again carried away, \r\nA brutal plunderer. Beowulf in his fury \r\nNow settled that score: he saw the monster \r\nIn his resting place, war-weary and wrecked, \r\nA lifeless corpse, a casualty \r\nOf the battle in Heorot. The body gaped \r\nAt the stroke dealt to it after death: \r\nBeowulf cut the corpse\xe2\x80\x99s head off. 1590 \r\nImmediately the counselors keeping a lookout \r\nWith Hrothgar, watching the lake water, \r\nSaw a heave-up and surge of waves \r\nAnd blood in the backwash. They bowed gray heads, Spoke in their sage, experienced way \r\nAbout the good warrior, how they never again \r\nExpected to see that prince returning \r\nIn triumph to their king. It was clear to many \r\nThat the wolf of the deep had destroyed him forever. \r\nThe ninth hour of the day arrived. 1600 The brave Shieldings abandoned their cliff-top \r\nAnd the king went home; but sick at heart, \r\nStaring at the mere, the strangers held on. \r\nThey wished, without hope, to behold their lord, \r\nBeowulf himself. \r\n Meanwhile, the sword\r\nBegan to wilt into gory icicles, \r\nTo slather and thaw. It was a wonderful thing, \r\nThe way it all melted as ice melts \r\nWhen the father eases the fetters off the frost \r\nAnd unravels the water-ropes. He who wields power 1610 Over time and tide: He is the true Lord. \r\nThe Geat captain saw treasure in abundance \r\nBut carried no spoils from those quarters \r\nExcept for the head and the inlaid hilt \r\nEmbossed with jewels; its blade had melted \r\nAnd the scrollwork on it burnt, so scalding was the blood Of the poisonous fiend who had perished there. \r\nThen away he swan, the one who had survived \r\nThe fall of his enemies, flailing to the surface. \r\nThe wide water, the waves and pools 1620 Were no longer infested once the wandering fiend \r\nLet go of her life and this unreliable world. \r\nThe seafarers\xe2\x80\x99 leader made for land, \r\nResolutely swimming, delighted with his prize, \r\nThe mighty load he was lugging to the surface. \r\nHis thanes advanced in a troop to meet him, \r\nThanking God and taking great delight \r\nIn seeing their prince back safe and sound. \r\nQuickly the hero\xe2\x80\x99s helmet and mail-shirt \r\nWere loosed and unlaced. The lake settled, 1630 Clouds darkened above the bloodshot depths. \r\nWith high hearts they headed away \r\nAlong footpath and trails through the fields, \r\nRoads that they knew, each of them wrestling \r\nWith the head they were carrying from the lakeside cliff, Men kingly in their courage and capable \r\nOf difficult work. It was a task for four \r\nTo hoist Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s head on a spear\r\nAnd bear it under strain to the bright hall. \r\nBut soon enough they neared the place, 1640 Fourteen Geats in fine fettle, \r\nStriding across the outlying ground \r\nIn a delighted throng around they leader. \r\nIn he came then, the thane\xe2\x80\x99s commander, \r\nThe arch-warrior, to address Hrothgar: \r\nHis courage was proven, his glory was secure. \r\nGrendel\xe2\x80\x99s head was hauled by the hair, \r\nDragged across the floor where people were drinking, A horror for both queen and company to behold. They stared in awe. It was an astonishing sight. 1650 \r\nBeowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, son of Halfdane, prince of the Shieldings, \r\nWe are glad to bring this booty from the lake. \r\nIt is a token of triumph and we tender it to you. I barely survived the battle underwater. \r\nIt was hard-fought, a desperate affair \r\nThat could have gone badly; if God had not helped me, The outcome would have been quick and fatal. \r\nAlthough Hrunting is hard-edged, \r\nI could never bring it to bear in battle. 1660 But the Lord of Men allowed me to behold-- \r\nFor he often helps the unbefriended-- \r\nAn ancient sword shinning on the wall, \r\nA weapon made for giants, there for the wielding. Then my moment came in the combat and I struck The dwellers in that den. Next thing the damascened Sword blade melted; it bloated and it burned \r\nIn their rushing blood. I have wrested the hilt \r\nFrom the enemies\xe2\x80\x99 hand, avenged the evil \r\nDone to the Danes; it is what was due. 1670 And this I pledge, O prince of the Shieldings:\r\nYou can sleep secure with your company of troops In Heorot Hall. Never need you fear \r\nFor a single thane of your sept or nation, \r\nYoung warriors or old, that laying waste of life That you and your people endured of yore.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nThen the gold hilt was handed over \r\nTo the old lord, a relic from long ago \r\nFor the venerable ruler. That rare smith work \r\nWas passed on to the prince of the Danes 1680 When those devils perished; once death removed That murdering, guilt-steeped, God-cursed fiend, Eliminating his unholy life \r\nAnd his mother\xe2\x80\x99s as well, it was willed that the king Who of all the lavish gift-lords of the north \r\nWas the best regarded between the two seas. \r\nHrothgar spoke; he examined the hilt, \r\nThat relic of old times. It was engraved all over And showed how war first came into the world And the flood destroyed the tribe of giants. 1690 They suffered a terrible severance from the Lord; The Almighty made the waters rise, \r\nDrowned them in the deluge for retribution. \r\nIn pure gold inlay on the sword-guards \r\nThere were rune markings correctly incised, \r\nStating and recording for whom the sword \r\nHad been first made and ornamented \r\nWith its scrollwork hilt. Then everyone hushed As the son of Halfdane spoke his wisdom. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA protector of his people, pledged to uphold 1700 Truth and justice and to respect tradition, \r\nIs entitled to affirm that this man \r\nWas born to distinction. Beowulf, my friend, \r\nYour fame has gone far and wide,\r\nYou are known everywhere. In all things you are even-tempered, Prudent and resolute. So I stand firm by the promise of friendship We exchanged before. Forever you will be \r\nYour people\xe2\x80\x99s mainstay and your own warriors\xe2\x80\x99 \r\nHelping hand. \r\n Heremod was different, \r\nThe way he behaved to Ecgwala\xe2\x80\x99s sons. 1710 His rise in the world brought little joy \r\nTo the Danish people, only death and destruction. \r\nHe vented his rage on people he caroused with, \r\nKilled his own comrades, a pariah king \r\nWho cut himself off from his own kind, \r\nEven though God Almighty had made him \r\nEminent and powerful and marked him from the start For a happy life. But a change happened, \r\nHe grew bloodthirsty, gave no more rings \r\nTo honor the Danes. He suffered in the end 1720 For having plagued his people for so long: \r\nHis life lost happiness. \r\n So learn from this \r\nAnd understand true values. I who tell you \r\nHave wintered into wisdom. \r\n It is a great wonder \r\nHow Almighty God in his magnificence \r\nFavors our race with rank and scope \r\nAnd the gift of wisdom; His sway is wide. \r\nSometimes He allows the mind of a man \r\nOf distinguished birth to follow its bent, \r\nGrants him fulfillment and felicity on earth 1730 And forts to command in his own country. \r\nHe permits him to lord it in many lands \r\nUntil the man in his unthinkingness  \r\nForgets that it will ever end for him. \r\nHe indulges his desires; illness and old age \r\nMean nothing to him; his mind is untroubled\r\nBy envy or malice or thought of enemies \r\nWith their hate-honed swords. The whole world Conforms to his will, he is kept from the worst Until an element of overweening 1740 Enters him and takes hold \r\nWhile the soul\xe2\x80\x99s guard, its sentry, drowses, \r\nGrown too distracted. A killer stalks him, \r\nAn archer who draws a deadly bow. \r\nAnd then the man is hit in the heart, \r\nThe arrow flies beneath his defenses, \r\nThe devious promptings of the demon start. \r\nHis old possessions seem paltry to him now. \r\nHe covets and resents; dishonors custom \r\nAnd bestows no gold; and because of good things 1750 That the Heavenly powers gave him in the past He ignores the shape of things to come. \r\nThen finally the end arrives \r\nWhen the body he was lent collapses and falls Prey to its death; ancestral possessions \r\nAnd the goods he hoarded and inherited by another Who lets them go with a liberal hand. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO flower of warriors, beware of that trap. \r\nChoose, dear Beowulf, the better part, \r\nEternal rewards. Do not give way to pride. 1760 For a brief while your strength is in bloom \r\nBut it fades quickly; and soon there will follow Illness or the sword to lay you low, \r\nOr a sudden fire or surge of water \r\nOr jabbing blade or javelin from the air \r\nOr repellent age. Your piercing eye \r\nWill dim and darken; and death will arrive, \r\nDear warrior, to sweep you away. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so I ruled the ring-Danes\xe2\x80\x99 country\r\nFor fifty years, defended them in wartime 1770 With spear and sword against constant assaults \r\nBy many tribes: I came to believe \r\nMy enemies had faded from the face of the earth. Still, what happened was a hard reversal \r\nFrom bliss to grief. Grendel struck \r\nAfter lying in wait. He laid waste the land \r\nAnd from that moment my mind was in dread \r\nOf his depredations. So I praise God \r\nIn His heavenly glory that I lived to behold \r\nThis head dripping blood and after such harrowing 1780 I can look upon it in triumph at last. \r\nTake your place, then, with pride and pleasure \r\nAnd move to the feast. Tomorrow morning \r\nOur treasure will be shared and showered upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nThe Geat was elated and gladly obeyed \r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s biding; he sat on the bench. \r\nAnd soon all was restored, the same as before. \r\nHappiness came back, the hall was thronged, \r\nAnd a banquet set forth; black night fell \r\nAnd covered them in darkness. 1790  Then the company rose \r\nFor the old campaigner: the gray-haired prince \r\nWas ready for bed. And a need for rest \r\nCame over the brave shield-bearing Geat. \r\nHe was a weary sea-farer, far from home, \r\nSo immediately a house-guard guided him out, \r\nOne whose office entailed looking after \r\nWhatever a thane on the road in those days \r\nMight need or require. It was noble courtesy. \r\nThat great heart rested. The hall towered, \r\nGold-shingled and gabled, and the guest slept in it 1800 Until the black raven with raucous glee\r\nAnnounced heaven\xe2\x80\x99s joy, and a hurry of brightness Overran the shadows. Warriors rose quickly, \r\nImpatient to be off: their own country \r\nWas beckoning the nobles; and the bold voyager \r\nLonged to be aboard his distant boat. \r\nThen that stalwart fighter ordered Hrunting \r\nTo be brought to Unferth, and bade Unferth \r\nTake the sword and thanked him for lending it. \r\nHe said he had found it a friend in battle 1810 And a powerful help; he put no blame \r\nOn the blade\xe2\x80\x99s cutting edge. He was a considerate man. \r\nAnd there the warriors stood in their war-gear, \r\nEager to go, while their honored lord \r\nApproached the platform where the other sat. \r\nThe undaunted hero addressed Hrothgar. \r\nBeowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we who crossed the wide sea \r\nHave to inform you that we feel a desire \r\nTo return to Hygelac. Here we have been welcomed 1820 And thoroughly entertain. You have treated us well. If there is any favor on earth I can perform \r\nBeyond deeds of arms I have done already, \r\nAnything that would merit your affections more, \r\nI shall act, my lord, with alacrity. \r\nIf ever I hear from across the ocean \r\nThat people on your borders are threatening battle \r\nAs attackers have done from time to time, \r\nI shall land with a thousand thanes at my back \r\nTo help your cause. Hygelac may be young 1830 To rule a nation, but this much I know \r\nAbout the king of the Geats: he will come to my aid And want to support me by word and action \r\nIn your hour of need, when honor dictates \r\nThat I raise a hedge of spears around you.\r\nThen if Hrethric should think about traveling \r\nAs a king\xe2\x80\x99s son to the court of the Geats, \r\nHe will find many friend. Foreign places \r\nYield more to one who is himself worth meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nHrothgar spoke and answered him: 1840 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord in his wisdom sent you those words \r\nAnd they came from the heart. I have never heard So young a man make truer observations. \r\nYou are strong in body and mature in mind, \r\nImpressive in speech. If it should come to pass \r\nThat Hrethel\xe2\x80\x99s descendant dies beneath a spear, \r\nIf deadly battle or the sword blade or disease \r\nFells the prince who guards your people \r\nAnd you are still alive, I firmly believe \r\nThe seafaring Geats won\xe2\x80\x99t find a man 1850 Worthier of acclaim as their king and defender \r\nThan you, if only you would undertake \r\nThe lordship of your homeland. My liking for you Deepens with time, dear Beowulf. \r\nWhat you have done is to draw two peoples, \r\nThe Geat nation and us neighboring Danes, \r\nInto shared peace and a pact of friendship \r\nIn spite of hatreds we have harbored in the past. \r\nFor as long as I rule this far-flung land \r\nTreasures will change hands and each side will treat 1860 The other with gifts; across the gannet\xe2\x80\x99s bath, \r\nOver the broad sea, whorled prows will bring \r\nPresents and tokens. I know your people \r\nAre beyond reproach in every respect, \r\nSteadfast in the old way with friend or foe.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nThen the earl\xe2\x80\x99s defender furnished the hero \r\nWith twelve treasures and told him to set out, \r\nSail with those gifts safely home\r\nTo the people he loved, but to return promptly. And so the good and gray-haired Dane, 1870 That high-born king, kissed Beowulf \r\nAnd embraced his neck, then broke down \r\nIn sudden tears. Two forebodings \r\nDisturbed him in his wisdom, but one was stronger: Nevermore would they meet each other \r\nFace to face. And such was his affection \r\nThat he could not help being overcome: \r\nHis fondness for the man was so deep-founded, It warmed his heart and wound the heartstrings Tight in his breast. 1880  The embrace ended \r\nAnd Beowulf, glorious in his gold regalia, \r\nStepped on the green earth. Straining at anchor And ready for boarding, his boat awaited him. So they went on their journey, and Hrothgar\xe2\x80\x99s generosity Was praised repeatedly. He was a peerless king Until old age sapped his strength and did him \r\nMortal harm, as it has done so many. \r\nDown to the waves then, dressed in the web \r\nOf their chain-mail and war-shirts the young men marched In high spirits. The coast-guard spied them, 1890 Thanes setting forth, the same as before. \r\nHis salute this time from the top of the cliff \r\nWas far from unmannerly; he galloped to meet them And as they took ship in their shinning gear, \r\nHe said how welcome they would be in Geatland. Then the broad hull was beached on the sand \r\nTo be cargoed with treasure, horses and war-gear. The curved prow motioned; the mast stood high Above Hrothgar\xe2\x80\x99s riches in the loaded hold. \r\nThe guard who had watched the boat was given 1900\r\nA sword with gold fittings and in future days \r\nThat present would make him a respected man At his place on the mead-bench. \r\n Then the keel plunged \r\nAnd shook in the sea; and they sailed from Denmark. \r\nRight away the mast was rigged with its sea-shawl; Sail ropes were tightened, timbers drummed \r\nAnd stiff winds kept the wave-crosser \r\nSkimming ahead; as she heaved forward, \r\nHer foamy neck was fleet and buoyant, \r\nA lapped prow loping over currents, 1910 Until finally the Geats caught sight of coastline And familiar cliffs. The keel reared up, \r\nWind lifted it home, it hit on the land. \r\nThe harbor guard came hurrying out \r\nTo the rolling water: he had watched the offing Long and hard, on the lookout for those friends. With the anchor cables, he moored their craft \r\nRight where it had beached, in case a backwash Might catch the hull and carry it away. \r\nThen he ordered the prince\xe2\x80\x99s treasure-trove 1920 To be carried ashore. It was a short step \r\nFrom there to where Hrethel\xe2\x80\x99s son and heir, \r\nHygelac the gold-giver, makes his home \r\nOn a secure cliff, in the company of retainers. \r\nThe building was magnificent, the king majestic, Ensconced in his hall; and although Hygd, his queen, Was young, a few short years at court, \r\nHer mind was thoughtful and her manners sure. Haereth\xe2\x80\x99s daughter behaved generously \r\nAnd stinted nothing when she distributed 1930 Bounty to the Geats.\r\n Great Queen Modthryth \r\nPerpetrated terrible wrongs. \r\nIf any retainer ever made bold \r\nTo look her in the face, if an eye not her lord\xe2\x80\x99s \r\nStared at her directly during daylight, \r\nThe outcome was sealed: he was bound \r\nIn hand-tightened shackles, racked, tortured \r\nUntil doom was announced--death by the sword, Slash of blade, blood gush and death qualms \r\nIn an evil display. Even a queen 1940 Outstanding in beauty must not overstep like that. A queen should weave peace, not punish the innocent With loss of life for imagined insults. \r\nBut Hemming\xe2\x80\x99s kinsman put a halt to her ways \r\nAnd drinkers round the table had another tale: \r\nShe was less of a bane to people\xe2\x80\x99s lives, \r\nLess cruel-minded, after she was married \r\nTo the brave Offa, a bride arrayed \r\nIn her gold finery, given away \r\nBy a caring father, ferried to her young prince 1950 Over dim seas. In days to come \r\nShe would grace the throne and grow famous \r\nFor her good deeds and conduct of life, \r\nHer high devotion to the hero king \r\nWho was the best king, it has been said, \r\nBetween the two seas or anywhere else \r\nOn the face of the earth. Offa was honored \r\nFar and wide for his generous ways, \r\nHis fighting spirit and his far-seeing \r\nDefense of his homeland; from him there sprang Eomer, 1960 Garmund\xe2\x80\x99s grandson, kinsman of Hemming, \r\nHis warrior\xe2\x80\x99s mainstay and master of the field. \r\nHeroic Beowulf and his band of men \r\nCrossed the wide strand, striding along\r\nThe sandy foreshore; the sun shone, \r\nThe world\xe2\x80\x99s candle warmed them from the south As they hastened to where, as they had heard, \r\nThe young king, Ongentheow\xe2\x80\x99s killer \r\nAnd his people\xe2\x80\x99s protector, was dispensing rings Inside his bawn. Beowulf\xe2\x80\x99s return 1970 Was reported to Hygelac as soon as possible, \r\nNews that the captain was now in the enclosure, His battle-brother back from the fray \r\nAlive and well, walking back to the hall. \r\nRoom was quickly made, on the king\xe2\x80\x99s orders, \r\nAnd the troops filed across the cleared floor. \r\nAfter Hygelac had offered greetings \r\nTo his loyal thane in lofty speech, \r\nHe and his kinsman, that hale survivor, \r\nSat face to face. Haereth\xe2\x80\x99s daughter 1980 Moved about with the mead-jug in her hand, \r\nTaking care of the company, filling the cups \r\nThat warriors held out. Then Hygelac began  \r\nTo put courteous questions to his old comrade \r\nIn the high hall. He hankered to know \r\nEvery tale the Sea-Geats had to tell. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you fare on your foreign voyage, \r\nDear Beowulf, when you abruptly decided \r\nTo sail away across the salt water \r\nAnd fight at Heorot? Did you help Hrothgar 1990 Much in the end? Could you ease the prince \r\nOf his well-known troubles? Your undertaking Cast my spirits down, I dreaded the outcome \r\nOf your expedition and pleaded with you \r\nLong and hard to leave the killer be, \r\nLet the South-Danes settle their own \r\nBlood-feud with Grendel. So God be thanked\r\nI am granted this sight of you, safe and sound.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nBeowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened, lord Hygelac, is hardly a secret 2000 Any more among men in this world-- \r\nMyself and Grendel coming to grips \r\nOn the very spot where he visited destruction \r\nOn the Victory-Shieldings and violated \r\nLife and limb, loses I avenged \r\nSo no earthly offspring of Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s \r\nNeed ever boast of that bout before dawn, \r\nNo matter know long the last of his evil \r\nFamily survives. \r\n When I first landed \r\nI hastened to the ring-hall and saluted Hrothgar. 2010 Once he had discovered why I had come \r\nThe son of Halfdane sent me immediately \r\nTo sit with his own sons on the bench. \r\nIt was a happy gathering. In my whole life \r\nI have never seen mead enjoyed more \r\nIn any hall on earth. Sometimes the queen \r\nHerself appeared, peace-pledge between nations, To hearten the young ones and hand out \r\nA torque to a warrior, then take her place. \r\nSometimes Hrothgar\xe2\x80\x99s daughter distributed 2020 Ale to older ranks, in order on the benches: \r\nI heard the company call her Freawaru \r\nAs she made her rounds, presenting men \r\nWith the gem-studded bowl, young bride-to-be \r\nTo the gracious Ingeld, in her gold-rimmed attire. The friend of the Shieldings favors her betrothal: The guardian of the kingdom sees good in it \r\nAnd hoped this woman will heal old wounds \r\nAnd grievous feuds. \r\n But generally the spear\r\nIs prompt to retaliate when a prince is killed, 2030 No matter how admirable the bride may be. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink how the Heathobards will be bound to feel, Their lord, Ingeld, and his loyal thanes, \r\nWhen he walks in with that woman to the feast: \r\nDanes are at the table, being entertained, \r\nHonored guest in glittering regalia, \r\nBurnished ring-mail that was their hosts\xe2\x80\x99 birthright, Looted when the Heathobards could no longer wield Their weapons in the shield-clash, when they went down With their beloved comrades and forfeited their lives. 2040 Then an old spearman will speak while they are drinking, Having glimpsed some heirloom that brings alive Memories of the massacre; his mood will darken And heart-stricken, in the stress of his emotion, \r\nHe will begin to test a young-man\xe2\x80\x99s temper \r\nAnd stir up trouble, starting like this: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my friend, don\xe2\x80\x99t you recognize \r\nYour father\xe2\x80\x99s sword, his favorite weapon, \r\nThen one he wore when he went out in his war-mask To face the Danes on that final day? 2050 After Wethergeld died and his men were doomed The Shieldings quickly took the field, \r\nAnd now here\xe2\x80\x99s the son of one or other \r\nOf those same killers coming through our hall \r\nOverbearing us, mouthing boasts, \r\nAnd rigged in armor that by right is yours.\xe2\x80\x99 \r\nAnd so he keeps on, recalling and accusing, \r\nWorking things up with bitter words \r\nUntil one of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s retainers lies \r\nSpattered in blood, split open 2060 On his father\xe2\x80\x99s account. The killer knows \r\nThe lie of the land and escaped with his life. \r\nThen on both sides the oath-bound lords\r\nWill break the peace, a passionate hate \r\nWill build up in Ingeld and love for his bride \r\nWill falter in him as the feud rankles. \r\nI therefore suspect the good faith of the Heathobards, The truth of their friendship and the trustworthiness Of their alliance with the Danes. \r\n But now, my lord, \r\nI shall carry on with my account of Grendel, 2070 The whole story of everything that happened \r\nIn the hand-to-hand fight. \r\n After heaven\xe2\x80\x99s gem \r\nHad gone mildly to earth, that maddened spirit, The terror of those twilights, came to attack us Where we stood guard, still safe inside the hall. There deadly violence came down on Handscio And he fell as fate ordained, the first to perish, \r\nRigged out for the combat. A comrade from our ranks Had come to grief in Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s maw: \r\nHe ate up the entire body. 2080 There was blood on his teeth, he was bloated and furious, All roused up, yet still unready \r\nTo leave the hall empty-handed; \r\nRenowned for his might, he matched himself against me, Wildly reaching. He had this roomy pouch, \r\nA strange accoutrement, intricately strung \r\nAnd hung at the ready, a rare patchwork \r\nOf devilishly fitting dragon-skins. \r\nI had done him no wrong, yet the raging demon Wanted to cram me and many another 2090 Into this bag--but it was not to be  \r\nOnce I got to my feet in a blind fury. \r\nIt would take too long to tell how I repaid \r\nThe terror of the land for every life he took \r\nAnd so won credit for you, my king, \r\nAnd for all your people. And although he got away\r\nTo enjoy life\xe2\x80\x99s sweetness for a while longer, \r\nHis right hand stayed behind him in Heorot, \r\nEvidence of his miserable overthrow \r\nAs he dived into murk on the mere bottom. 2100 \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got lavish rewards from the lord of the Danes For my part in the battle, beaten gold \r\nAnd much else, once morning came \r\nAnd we took our places at the banquet table. \r\nThere was singing and excitement: an old reciter, A carrier of stories, recalled the early days. \r\nAt times some hero made the timbered harp \r\nTremble with sweetness, or related true \r\nAnd tragic happenings; at times the king \r\nGave the proper turn to some fantastic tale, 2110 Or a battle-scarred veteran, bowed with age, \r\nWould begin to remember the martial deeds \r\nOf his youth and prime and be overcome \r\nAs the past welled up in his wintry heart. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were happy there the whole day long \r\nAnd enjoyed our time until another night \r\nDescended upon us. Then suddenly \r\nThe vehement mother avenged her son \r\nAnd wreaked destruction. Death had robbed her; Geats had slain Grendel, so his ghastly dam 2120 Struck back and with bare-faced defiance \r\nLaid a man low. Thus life departed \r\nFrom the sage Auschere, an elder wise in council. But afterwards, on the morning following, \r\nThe Danes could not burn the dead body \r\nNor lay the remains of the man they loved \r\nOn his funeral pyre. She had fled with the corpse And taken refuge beneath torrents on the mountain. It was a hard blow for Hrothgar to bear,\r\nHarder than any he had undergone before. 2130 And so the heartsore king beseeched me \r\nIn your royal name to take my chances \r\nUnderwater, to win glory \r\nAnd prove my worth. He promised me rewards. Hence, as is well known, I went to my encounter With the terror-monger at the bottom of the tarn. For a while it was hand-to-hand between us, \r\nThen blood went curdling along the currents \r\nAnd I beheaded Grendel\xe2\x80\x99s mother in the hall \r\nWith a mighty sword. I barely managed 2140 To escape with my life; my time had not yet come. But Halfdane\xe2\x80\x99s heir, the shelter of those earls, \r\nAgain endowed me with gifts in abundance. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus the king acted with due custom. \r\nI was paid and recompensed completely, \r\nGiven full measure and the freedom to choose \r\nFrom Hrothgar\xe2\x80\x99s treasures by Hrothgar himself. These, King Hygelac, I am happy to present \r\nTo you as gifts. It is still upon your grace \r\nThat all favor depends. I have few kinsman 2150 Who are close, my king, except for your kind self.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he order the boar-framed standard to be brought, The battle-topping helmet, the mail-shirt gray as hoar-frost And the precious war-sword; and proceeded with his speech. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Hrothgar presented this war-gear to me He instructed, my lord, to give you some account Of why it signifies his special favor. \r\nHe said it had belonged to his older brother, \r\nKing Heorogar, who had long kept it, \r\nBut that Heorogar had never bequeathed it 2160 To his son Heoroweard, that worthy scion, \r\nLoyal as he was. \r\n Enjoy it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI heard four horses were handed over next. \r\nBeowulf bestowed four bay steeds \r\nTo go with the armor, swift gallopers, \r\nAll alike. So ought a kinsman act, \r\nInstead of plotting and planning in secret \r\nTo bring people to grief, or conspiring to arrange The death of comrades. The warrior king \r\nWas uncle to Beowulf and honored by his nephew: 2170 Each was concerned for the other\xe2\x80\x99s good. \r\nI heard he presented Hygd with a gorget, \r\nThe priceless torque that the prince\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, \r\nWealhtheow, had given him; and three horses, \r\nSupple creatures, brilliantly saddled. \r\nThe bright necklace would be luminous on Hygd\xe2\x80\x99s breast. \r\nThus Beowuld bore himself with valor; \r\nHe was formidable in battle yet behaved with honor And took no advantage: never cut down \r\nA comrade who was drunk, kept his temper 2180 And, warrior that he was, watched and controlled His God-sent strength and his outstanding \r\nNatural powers. He had been poorly regarded \r\nFor a long time, was taken by the Geats \r\nFor less than he was worth: and their lord too \r\nHad never much esteemed him in the mead-hall. They firmly believed that he lacked force, \r\nThat the prince was a weakling; but presently \r\nEvery affront to his deserving was reversed. \r\nThe battle-famed king, bulwark of his earls, 2190 Ordered a gold-chased heirloom of Hrethel\xe2\x80\x99s \r\nTo be brought in; it was the best example  \r\nOf a gem-studded sword in the Geat treasury.\r\nThis he laid on Beowulf\xe2\x80\x99s lap \r\nAnd then rewarded him with land as well, \r\nSeven thousand hides, and a hall and a throne. \r\nBoth owned land by birth in that country, \r\nAncestral ground; but the greater right \r\nAnd sway were inherited by the higher born. \r\nA lot was to happen in later days 2200 In the fury of battle. Hygelac fell \r\nAnd the shelter of Heardred\xe2\x80\x99s shield proved useless Against the fierce aggression of the Shylfings: \r\nRuthless swordsmen, seasoned campaigners, \r\nThey came against him and his conquering nation, And with cruel force cut him down \r\nSo that afterwards \r\n The wide kingdom \r\nReverted to Beowulf. He ruled it well \r\nFor fifty winters, grew old and wise \r\nAs warden of the land 2210  Until one began \r\nTo dominate the dark, a dragon on the prowl \r\nFrom the steep vaults of a stone-roofed barrow \r\nWhere he guarded a hoard; there was a hidden passage, Unknown to men, but someone managed \r\nTo enter by it and interfere \r\nWith the heathen trove. He had handled and removed A gem-studded goblet; it gained him nothing, \r\nThough with a thief\xe2\x80\x99s wiles he had outwitted \r\nThe sleeping dragon; that drove him into rage, \r\nAs the people of that country would soon discover. 2220 \r\nThe intruder who broached the dragon\xe2\x80\x99s treasure And moved him to wrath had never meant to. \r\nIt was desperation on the part of a slave \r\nFleeing the heavy hand of some master,\r\nGuilt-ridden and on the run, \r\nGoing to ground. But he soon began \r\nTo shake with terror\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6..in shock \r\nThe wretch\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6. \r\n\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6..panicked and ran \r\nAway with the precious\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6. 2230 Metalwork. There were many other \r\nHeirlooms heaped inside the earth-house, \r\nBecause long ago, with deliberate care, \r\nSomebody now forgotten \r\nHad buried the riches of a high-born race \r\nIn this ancient cache. Death had come \r\nAnd taken them all in times gone by \r\nAnd the only one left to tell their tale, \r\nThe last of their line, could look forward to nothing But the same fate for himself: he foresaw that his joy 2240 In the treasure would be brief. \r\n A newly constructed \r\nBarrow stood waiting, on a wide headland \r\nClose to the waves, its entryway secured. \r\nInto it the keeper of the hoard had carried \r\nAll the goods and golden ware \r\nWorth preserving. His words were few: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, earth, hold what earls once held \r\nAnd heroes can no more; it was mined from you first By honorable men. My own people \r\nHave been ruined in war; one by one 2250 They went down to death, looked their last \r\nOn sweet life in the hall. I am left with nobody \r\nTo bear a sword or burnish plated goblets, \r\nPut a sheen on the cup. The companies have departed. The hard helmet, hasped with gold, \r\nWill be stripped of its hoops; and the helmet-shiner Who should polish the metal of the war-mask sleeps; The coat of mail that came through all fights,\r\nThrough shield-collapse and cut of sword, \r\nDecays with the warrior. Now may webbed mail 2260 Range far and wide on a warlord\xe2\x80\x99s back \r\nBeside his mustered troops. No trembling harp, No tuned timber, no tumbling hawk \r\nSwerving through the hall, no swift horse \r\nPawing the courtyard. pillage and slaughter \r\nHave emptied the earth of entire peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nAnd so he mourned as he moved about the world, Deserted and alone, lamenting his unhappiness Day and night, until death\xe2\x80\x99s flood \r\nBrimmed up in his heart. 2270  Then an old harrower of the dark Happened to find the hoard open, \r\nThe burning one who hunts out barrows, \r\nThe slick-skinned dragon, threatening the night sky With streamers of fire. People on the farms \r\nAre in dread of him. He is driven to hunt out \r\nHoards under ground, to guard heathen gold \r\nThrough age-long vigils, though to little avail. For three centuries, this scourge of the people \r\nHad stood guard on that stoutly protected \r\nUnderground treasury, until the intruder 2280 Unleashed its fury; he hurried to his lord \r\nWith the gold-plated cup and made his plea \r\nTo be reinstated. Then the vault was rifled, \r\nThe ring-hoard robbed, and the wretched man \r\nHad his request granted. His master gazed \r\nOn that find from the past for the first time. \r\nWhen the dragon awoke, trouble flared again. \r\nHe rippled down the rock, writhing with anger When he saw the footprints of the prowler who had stolen Too close to his dreaming head. 2290 So may a man not marked by fate\r\nEasily escape exile and woe \r\nBy the grace of God. \r\n The hoard-guardian \r\nScorched the ground as he scoured and hunted \r\nFor the trespasser who had troubled his sleep. \r\nHot and savage, he kept circling and circling  \r\nThe outside of the mound. No man appeared \r\nIn that desert waste, but he worked himself up \r\nBy imagining battle; then back in he\xe2\x80\x99d go \r\nIn search of the cup, only to discover 2300 Signs that someone had stumbled upon \r\nThe golden treasures. The guardian of the mound, The hoard-watcher, waited for the gloaming \r\nWith fierce impatience; his pent-up fury \r\nAt the loss of the vessel made him long to hit back And lash out in flames. Then, to his delight, \r\nThe day waned and he could wait no longer \r\nBehind the wall, but hurtled forth \r\nIn a fiery blaze. The first to suffer \r\nWere the people on the land, but before long 2310 It was their treasure-giver who would come to grief. \r\nThe dragon began to belch out flames \r\nAnd burn bright homesteads; there was a hot glow That scared everyone, for the vile sky-winger \r\nWould leave nothing alive in his wake. \r\nEverywhere the havoc he wrought was in evidence. Far and near, the Geat nation \r\nBore the brunt of his brutal assaults \r\nAnd virulent hate. Then back to the hoard \r\nHe would dart before daybreak, to hide in his den. 2320 He had swinged the land, swathed it in flame, \r\nIn fire and burning, and now he felt secure \r\nIn the vaults of his burrow; but his trust was unavailing.\r\nThen Beowulf was given bad news, \r\nA hard truth: his own home, \r\nThe best of buildings, had been burnt to a cinder, The throne-room of the Geats. It threw the hero Into deep anguish and darkened his mood: \r\nThe wise man thought he must have thwarted \r\nAncient ordinance of the eternal Lord, 2330 Broken His commandment. His mind was in turmoil, Unaccustomed anxiety and gloom \r\nConfused his brain; the fire-dragon \r\nHad rased the coastal region and reduced \r\nForts and earthworks to dust and ashes, \r\nSo the war-king planned and plotted his revenge. The warriors\xe2\x80\x99 protector, prince of the hall-troop, Ordered a marvelous all-iron shield \r\nFrom his smithy works. He well knew \r\nThat linden boards would let him down 2340 And timber burn. After many trials, \r\nHe was destined to face the end of his days \r\nIn this mortal world; as was the dragon, \r\nFor all his leasehold on the treasure. \r\nYet the prince of the rings was too proud \r\nTo line up with a large army \r\nAgainst the sky-plague. He had scant regard \r\nFor the dragon as a threat, no dread at all \r\nOf its courage or strength, for he had kept going Often in the past, through perils and ordeals 2350 Of every sort, after he had purged \r\nHrothgar\xe2\x80\x99s hall, triumphed in Heorot \r\nAnd beaten Grendel. He outgrappled the monster And his evil kin. \r\n One of his cruelest \r\nHand-to-hand encounters had happened \r\nWhen Hygelac, king of the Geats, was killed\r\nIn Friesland: the people\xe2\x80\x99s friend and lord, \r\nHrethel\xe2\x80\x99s son, slaked a sword blade\xe2\x80\x99s \r\nThirst for blood. But Beowulf\xe2\x80\x99s prodigious \r\nGifts as a swimmer guaranteed his safety: 2360 He arrived at the shore, shouldering thirty \r\nBattle-dresses, the booty he had won. \r\nThere was little for the Hetware to be happy about As they shielded their faces and fighting on the ground Began in earnest. With Beowulf against them, Few could hope to return home. \r\nAcross the wide sea, desolate and alone, \r\nThe son of Ecgtheow swam back to his people. There Hygd offered him throne and authority \r\nAs lord of the ring-hoard: with Hygelac dead, 2370 She had no belief in her son\xe2\x80\x99s ability \r\nTo defend their homeland against foreign invaders. Yet there was no way the weakened nation \r\nCould get Beowulf to give in and agree \r\nTo be elevated over Heardred as his lord \r\nOr to undertake the office of kingship. \r\nBut he did provide support for the prince, \r\nHonored and minded him until he matured \r\nAs the ruler of Geatland. \r\n Then over sea-roads \r\nExiles arrived, sons of Ohthere. 2380 They had rebelled against the best of all \r\nThe sea-kings in Sweden, the one who held sway In the Shylfing nation, their renowned prince, \r\nLord of the mead-hall. That marked the end \r\nFor Hygelac\xe2\x80\x99s son: his hospitality \r\nWas mortally rewarded with wounds from a sword. Heardred lay slaughtered and Onela returned \r\nTo the land of Sweden, leaving Beowulf \r\nTo ascend the throne, to sit in majesty\r\nAnd rule over the Geats. He was a good king. 2390 \r\nIn days to come, he contrived to avenge \r\nThe fall of his prince; he befriended Eadgils \r\nWhen Eadgils was friendless, aiding his cause \r\nWith weapons and warriors over the wide sea, \r\nSending him men. The feud was settled \r\nOn a comfortless campaign when he killed Onela. \r\nAnd so the son of Ecgtheow had survived \r\nEvery extreme, excelling himself \r\nIn daring and in danger, until the day arrived \r\nWhen he had to come face to face with the dragon. 2400 The lord of the Geats took eleven comrades \r\nAnd went in a rage to reconnoiter. \r\nBy then he had discovered the cause of the affliction Being visited on the people. The precious cup \r\nHad come to him from the hand of the finder, \r\nThe one who had started all this strife \r\nAnd was now added as a thirteenth to their number. They press-ganged and compelled this poor creature To be their guide. Against his will \r\nHe led them to the earth-vault he alone knew, 2410 An underground barrow near the sea-billows \r\nAnd heaving waves, heaped inside \r\nWith exquisite metalwork. The one who stood guard Was dangerous and watchful, warden of that trove Buried under earth: no easy bargain \r\nWould be made in that place by any man. \r\nThe veteran king sat down on the cliff-top. \r\nHe wished good luck to the Geats who had shared His hearth and his gold. He was sad at heart, \r\nUnsettled yet ready, sensing his own death. 2420 His fate hovered near, unknowable but certain:\r\nIt would soon claim his coffered soul, \r\nPart life from limb. Before long \r\nThe prince\xe2\x80\x99s spirit would spin free from his body. \r\nBeowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke: \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany a skirmish I survived when I was young And many times of war; I remember them well. At seven, I was fostered out by my father, \r\nLeft in the charge of my people\xe2\x80\x99s lord. \r\nKing Hrethel kept me and took care of me, 2430 Was open-handed, behaved lie a kinsman. \r\nWhile I was his ward, he treated me no worse \r\nAs a wean about the place than one of his own boys, Herebeald and Haethcyn, or my own Hygelac. \r\nFor the eldest, Herebeald, an unexpected \r\nDeathbed was laid out, through a brother\xe2\x80\x99s doing, When Haethcyn bent his horn-tipped bow \r\nAnd loosed the arrow that destroyed his life. \r\nHe shot wide and buried a shaft \r\nIn the flesh and blood of his own brother. 2440 That offence was beyond redress, a wrong footing Of the heart\xe2\x80\x99s affections; for who could avenge The prince\xe2\x80\x99s life or pay his death-price? \r\nIt was like the misery felt by an old man \r\nWho has lived to see his son\xe2\x80\x99s body \r\nSwing on the gallows. He begins to keen \r\nAnd weep for his boy, watching the raven \r\nGloat where he hangs: he can be of no help. \r\nThe wisdom of age is worthless to him. \r\nMorning after morning, he wakes to remember 2450 That his child is gone; he has no interest \r\nIn living on until another heir \r\nIs born in the hall, now that his first-born \r\nHas entered death\xe2\x80\x99s dominion forever. \r\nHe gazes sorrowfully at his son\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling,\r\nThe banquet hall bereft of all delight, \r\nThe windswept hearthstone; the horsemen are sleeping, The warriors underground; what was is no more. No tunes from the harp, no cheer raised in the yard. Alone with his longing, he lies down on his bed 2460 And sings a lament; everything seems too large, The steadings and the fields. \r\n Such was the feeling \r\nOf loss endured by the lord of the Geats \r\nAfter Herebeald\xe2\x80\x99s death. He was hopelessly placed To set to rights the wrong committed, \r\nCould not punish the killer in accordance of the law Of the blood-feud, although he felt no love for him. Heartsore, wearied, he turned away \r\nFrom life\xe2\x80\x99s joys, chose God\xe2\x80\x99s light \r\nAnd departed, leaving buildings and lands 2470 To his sons, as a man of substance will. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen over the wide seas Swedes and Geats \r\nBattled and feuded and fought without quarter. \r\nHostilities broke out when Hrethel died. \r\nOngentheow\xe2\x80\x99s sons were unrelenting, \r\nRefusing to make peace, campaigning violently From coast to coast, constantly setting up \r\nTerrible ambushes around Hreasnshill. \r\nMy own kith and kin avenged \r\nThese evil events, as everybody knows, 2480 But the price was high: one of them paid \r\nWith his life. Heathcyn, lord of the Geats, \r\nMet his fate there and fell in battle. \r\nThen, as I have heard, Hygelac\xe2\x80\x99s sword \r\nWas raised in the morning against Ongentheow, His brother\xe2\x80\x99s killer. When Eofor cleft \r\nThe old Swede\xe2\x80\x99s helmet, halved it open, \r\nHe fell, death-pale: his feud-calloused hand\r\nCould not stave off the fatal stroke. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe treasures that Hygelac lavished on me 2490 I paid for as I fought, as fortune allowed me, \r\nWith my glittering sword. He gave me land \r\nAnd the security land brings, so he had no call \r\nTo go looking for some lesser champion, \r\nSome mercenary among the Grifthas \r\nOr the Spear-Danes or the men of Sweden. \r\nI marched ahead of him, always there \r\nAt the front of the line; and I shall fight like that \r\nFor as long as I live, as long as this sword \r\nShall last, which has stood me in good stead 2500 Late and soon, ever since I killed \r\nDayraven the Frank in front of the two armies. \r\nHe brought back no looted breastplate \r\nTo the Frisian king, but fell in battle, \r\nTheir standard-bearer, high-born and brave. \r\nNo sword blade sent him to his death, \r\nMy bare hands stilled his heartbeats \r\nAnd wrecked the bone-house. Now blade and hand, Sword and sword-stroke, will assay the hoard.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nBeowulf spoke, made a formal boast 2510 For the last time: \xe2\x80\x9cI risked my life \r\nOften when I was young. Now I am old, \r\nBut as king of this people I shall pursue this fight \r\nFor the glory of winning, if the evil one will only  \r\nAbandon his earth-fort and face me in the open.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nThen he addressed each dear companion \r\nOne final time, those fighters in their helmets, \r\nResolute and high-born: \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not \r\nUse a weapon if I knew another way \r\nTo grapple with the dragon and make good my boast 2520\r\nAs I did against Grendel in days gone by. \r\nBut I shall be meeting molten venom \r\nIn the fire he breaths, so I go forth \r\nIn mail-shirt and shield. I won\xe2\x80\x99t shift a foot \r\nWhen I meet the cave-guard: what occurs on the wall Between the two of us will turn out as fate, \r\nOverseer of men, decides. I am resolved. \r\nI scorn further words against this sky-born foe. \r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen at arms, remain here on the barrow, \r\nSafe in your armor, to see which one of us 2530 Is better in the end at bearing wounds \r\nIn a deadly fray. This fight is not yours, \r\nNor is it up to any man except me \r\nTo measure his strength against the monster \r\nOr to prove his worth. I shall win the gold \r\nBy my courage, or else mortal combat, \r\nDoom of battle, will bear your lord away.\xe2\x80\x9d \r\nThen he drew himself up beside his shield. \r\nThe fabled warrior in his war-shirt and helmet \r\nTrusted in his own strength entirely 2540 And went under the crag. No coward path. \r\nHard by the rock-face that hale veteran, \r\nA good man who had gone repeatedly \r\nInto combat and danger and come through, \r\nSaw a stone arch and a gushing stream \r\nThat burst from the barrow, blazing and wafting A deadly heat. It would be hard to survive \r\nUnscathed near the hoard, to hold firm \r\nAgainst the dragon in those flaming depths. \r\nThen he gave a shout. The lord of the Geats 2550 Unburdened his breast and broke out \r\nIn a storm of anger. Under gray stone \r\nHis voice challenged and resounded clearly.\n'
