man once I was,\r    And both my parents were of Lombardy,\r    And Mantuans by country both of them.\r\r\xc3\x94Sub Julio\xc3\x95 was I born, though it was late,\r    And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,\r    During the time of false and lying gods.\r\rA poet was I, and I sang that just\r    Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,\r    After that Ilion the superb was burned.\r\rBut thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?\r    Why climb\xc3\x95st thou not the Mount Delectable,\r    Which is the source and cause of every joy?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain\r    Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?\xc3\x93\r    I made response to him with bashful forehead.\r\r\xc3\x92O, of the other poets honour and light,\r    Avail me the long study and great love\r    That have impelled me to explore thy volume!\r\rThou art my master, and my author thou,\r    Thou art alone the one from whom I took\r    The beautiful style that has done honour to me.\r\rBehold the beast, for which I have turned back;\r    Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,\r    For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Thee it behoves to take another road,\xc3\x93\r    Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,\r    \xc3\x92If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;\r\rBecause this beast, at which thou criest out,\r    Suffers not any one to pass her way,\r    But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;\r\rAnd has a nature so malign and ruthless,\r    That never doth she glut her greedy will,\r    And after food is hungrier than before.\r\rMany the animals with whom she weds,\r    And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound\r    Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.\r\rHe shall not feed on either earth or pelf,\r    But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;\r    \xc3\x95Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;\r\rOf that low Italy shall he be the saviour,\r    On whose account the maid Camilla died,\r    Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;\r\rThrough every city shall he hunt her down,\r    Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,\r    There from whence envy first did let her loose.\r\rTherefore I think and judge it for thy best\r    Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,\r    And lead thee hence through the eternal place,\r\rWhere thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,\r    Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,\r    Who cry out each one for the second death;\r\rAnd thou shalt see those who contented are\r    Within the fire, because they hope to come,\r    Whene\xc3\x95er it may be, to the blessed people;\r\rTo whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,\r    A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;\r    With her at my departure I will leave thee;\r\rBecause that Emperor, who reigns above,\r    In that I was rebellious to his law,\r    Wills that through me none come into his city.\r\rHe governs everywhere, and there he reigns;\r    There is his city and his lofty throne;\r    O happy he whom thereto he elects!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92Poet, I thee entreat,\r    By that same God whom thou didst never know,\r    So that I may escape this woe and worse,\r\rThou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,\r    That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,\r    And those thou makest so disconsolate.\xc3\x93\r\rThen he moved on, and I behind him followed.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto II\r\r\rDay was departing, and the embrowned air\r    Released the animals that are on earth\r    From their fatigues; and I the only one\r\rMade myself ready to sustain the war,\r    Both of the way and likewise of the woe,\r    Which memory that errs not shall retrace.\r\rO Muses, O high genius, now assist me!\r    O memory, that didst write down what I saw,\r    Here thy nobility shall be manifest!\r\rAnd I began: \xc3\x92Poet, who guidest me,\r    Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,\r    Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.\r\rThou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,\r    While yet corruptible, unto the world\r    Immortal went, and was there bodily.\r\rBut if the adversary of all evil\r    Was courteous, thinking of the high effect\r    That issue would from him, and who, and what,\r\rTo men of intellect unmeet it seems not;\r    For he was of great Rome, and of her empire\r    In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;\r\rThe which and what, wishing to speak the truth,\r    Were stablished as the holy place, wherein\r    Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.\r\rUpon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,\r    Things did he hear, which the occasion were\r    Both of his victory and the papal mantle.\r\rThither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,\r    To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,\r    Which of salvation\xc3\x95s way is the beginning.\r\rBut I, why thither come, or who concedes it?\r    I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,\r    Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.\r\rTherefore, if I resign myself to come,\r    I fear the coming may be ill-advised;\r    Thou\xc3\x95rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd as he is, who unwills what he willed,\r    And by new thoughts doth his intention change,\r    So that from his design he quite withdraws,\r\rSuch I became, upon that dark hillside,\r    Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,\r    Which was so very prompt in the beginning.\r\r\xc3\x92If I have well thy language understood,\xc3\x93\r    Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,\r    \xc3\x92Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,\r\rWhich many times a man encumbers so,\r    It turns him back from honoured enterprise,\r    As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.\r\rThat thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,\r    I\xc3\x95ll tell thee why I came, and what I heard\r    At the first moment when I grieved for thee.\r\rAmong those was I who are in suspense,\r    And a fair, saintly Lady called to me\r    In such wise, I besought her to command me.\r\rHer eyes where shining brighter than the Star;\r    And she began to say, gentle and low,\r    With voice angelical, in her own language:\r\r\xc3\x94O spirit courteous of Mantua,\r    Of whom the fame still in the world endures,\r    And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;\r\rA friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,\r    Upon the desert slope is so impeded\r    Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,\r\rAnd may, I fear, already be so lost,\r    That I too late have risen to his succour,\r    From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.\r\rBestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,\r    And with what needful is for his release,\r    Assist him so, that I may be consoled.\r\rBeatrice am I, who do bid thee go;\r    I come from there, where I would fain return;\r    Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.\r\rWhen I shall be in presence of my Lord,\r    Full often will I praise thee unto him.\xc3\x95\r    Then paused she, and thereafter I began:\r\r\xc3\x94O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom\r    The human race exceedeth all contained\r    Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,\r\rSo grateful unto me is thy commandment,\r    To obey, if \xc3\x95twere already done, were late;\r    No farther need\xc3\x95st thou ope to me thy wish.\r\rBut the cause tell me why thou dost not shun\r    The here descending down into this centre,\r    From the vast place thou burnest to return to.\xc3\x95\r\r\xc3\x94Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,\r    Briefly will I relate,\xc3\x95 she answered me,\r    \xc3\x94Why I am not afraid to enter here.\r\rOf those things only should one be afraid\r    Which have the power of doing others harm;\r    Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.\r\rGod in his mercy such created me\r    That misery of yours attains me not,\r    Nor any flame assails me of this burning.\r\rA gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves\r    At this impediment, to which I send thee,\r    So that stern judgment there above is broken.\r\rIn her entreaty she besought Lucia,\r    And said, \xc3\x92Thy faithful one now stands in need\r    Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.\xc3\x93\r\rLucia, foe of all that cruel is,\r    Hastened away, and came unto the place\r    Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.\r\r\xc3\x92Beatrice\xc3\x93 said she, \xc3\x92the true praise of God,\r    Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,\r    For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?\r\rDost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?\r    Dost thou not see the death that combats him\r    Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?\xc3\x93\r\rNever were persons in the world so swift\r    To work their weal and to escape their woe,\r    As I, after such words as these were uttered,\r\rCame hither downward from my blessed seat,\r    Confiding in thy dignified discourse,\r    Which honours thee, and those who\xc3\x95ve listened to it.\xc3\x95\r\rAfter she thus had spoken unto me,\r    Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;\r    Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;\r\rAnd unto thee I came, as she desired;\r    I have delivered thee from that wild beast,\r    Which barred the beautiful mountain\xc3\x95s short ascent.\r\rWhat is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?\r    Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?\r    Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,\r\rSeeing that three such Ladies benedight\r    Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,\r    And so much good my speech doth promise thee?\xc3\x93\r\rEven as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,\r    Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,\r    Uplift themselves all open on their stems;\r\rSuch I became with my exhausted strength,\r    And such good courage to my heart there coursed,\r    That I began, like an intrepid person:\r\r\xc3\x92O she compassionate, who succoured me,\r    And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon\r    The words of truth which she addressed to thee!\r\rThou hast my heart so with desire disposed\r    To the adventure, with these words of thine,\r    That to my first intent I have returned.\r\rNow go, for one sole will is in us both,\r    Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.\xc3\x93\r    Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,\r\rI entered on the deep and savage way.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto III\r\r\r\xc3\x92Through me the way is to the city dolent;\r    Through me the way is to eternal dole;\r    Through me the way among the people lost.\r\rJustice incited my sublime Creator;\r    Created me divine Omnipotence,\r    The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.\r\rBefore me there were no created things,\r    Only eterne, and I eternal last.\r    All hope abandon, ye who enter in!\xc3\x93\r\rThese words in sombre colour I beheld\r    Written upon the summit of a gate;\r    Whence I: \xc3\x92Their sense is, Master, hard to me!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me, as one experienced:\r    \xc3\x92Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,\r    All cowardice must needs be here extinct.\r\rWe to the place have come, where I have told thee\r    Thou shalt behold the people dolorous\r    Who have foregone the good of intellect.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd after he had laid his hand on mine\r    With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,\r    He led me in among the secret things.\r\rThere sighs, complaints, and ululations loud\r    Resounded through the air without a star,\r    Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.\r\rLanguages diverse, horrible dialects,\r    Accents of anger, words of agony,\r    And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,\r\rMade up a tumult that goes whirling on\r    For ever in that air for ever black,\r    Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.\r\rAnd I, who had my head with horror bound,\r    Said: \xc3\x92Master, what is this which now I hear?\r    What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92This miserable mode\r    Maintain the melancholy souls of those\r    Who lived withouten infamy or praise.\r\rCommingled are they with that caitiff choir\r    Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,\r    Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.\r\rThe heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;\r    Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,\r    For glory none the damned would have from them.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92O Master, what so grievous is\r    To these, that maketh them lament so sore?\xc3\x93\r    He answered: \xc3\x92I will tell thee very briefly.\r\rThese have no longer any hope of death;\r    And this blind life of theirs is so debased,\r    They envious are of every other fate.\r\rNo fame of them the world permits to be;\r    Misericord and Justice both disdain them.\r    Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I, who looked again, beheld a banner,\r    Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,\r    That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;\r\rAnd after it there came so long a train\r    Of people, that I ne\xc3\x95er would have believed\r    That ever Death so many had undone.\r\rWhen some among them I had recognised,\r    I looked, and I beheld the shade of him\r    Who made through cowardice the great refusal.\r\rForthwith I comprehended, and was certain,\r    That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches\r    Hateful to God and to his enemies.\r\rThese miscreants, who never were alive,\r    Were naked, and were stung exceedingly\r    By gadflies and by hornets that were there.\r\rThese did their faces irrigate with blood,\r    Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet\r    By the disgusting worms was gathered up.\r\rAnd when to gazing farther I betook me.\r    People I saw on a great river\xc3\x95s bank;\r    Whence said I: \xc3\x92Master, now vouchsafe to me,\r\rThat I may know who these are, and what law\r    Makes them appear so ready to pass over,\r    As I discern athwart the dusky light.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92These things shall all be known\r    To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay\r    Upon the dismal shore of Acheron.\xc3\x93\r\rThen with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,\r    Fearing my words might irksome be to him,\r    From speech refrained I till we reached the river.\r\rAnd lo! towards us coming in a boat\r    An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,\r    Crying: \xc3\x92Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!\r\rHope nevermore to look upon the heavens;\r    I come to lead you to the other shore,\r    To the eternal shades in heat and frost.\r\rAnd thou, that yonder standest, living soul,\r    Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!\xc3\x93\r    But when he saw that I did not withdraw,\r\rHe said: \xc3\x92By other ways, by other ports\r    Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;\r    A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd unto him the Guide: \xc3\x92Vex thee not, Charon;\r    It is so willed there where is power to do\r    That which is willed; and farther question not.\xc3\x93\r\rThereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks\r    Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,\r    Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.\r\rBut all those souls who weary were and naked\r    Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,\r    As soon as they had heard those cruel words.\r\rGod they blasphemed and their progenitors,\r    The human race, the place, the time, the seed\r    Of their engendering and of their birth!\r\rThereafter all together they drew back,\r    Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,\r    Which waiteth every man who fears not God.\r\rCharon the demon, with the eyes of glede,\r    Beckoning to them, collects them all together,\r    Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.\r\rAs in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,\r    First one and then another, till the branch\r    Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;\r\rIn similar wise the evil seed of Adam\r    Throw themselves from that margin one by one,\r    At signals, as a bird unto its lure.\r\rSo they depart across the dusky wave,\r    And ere upon the other side they land,\r    Again on this side a new troop assembles.\r\r\xc3\x92My son,\xc3\x93 the courteous Master said to me,\r    \xc3\x92All those who perish in the wrath of God\r    Here meet together out of every land;\r\rAnd ready are they to pass o\xc3\x95er the river,\r    Because celestial Justice spurs them on,\r    So that their fear is turned into desire.\r\rThis way there never passes a good soul;\r    And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,\r    Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.\xc3\x93\r\rThis being finished, all the dusk champaign\r    Trembled so violently, that of that terror\r    The recollection bathes me still with sweat.\r\rThe land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,\r    And fulminated a vermilion light,\r    Which overmastered in me every sense,\r\rAnd as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto IV\r\r\rBroke the deep lethargy within my head\r    A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,\r    Like to a person who by force is wakened;\r\rAnd round about I moved my rested eyes,\r    Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,\r    To recognise the place wherein I was.\r\rTrue is it, that upon the verge I found me\r    Of the abysmal valley dolorous,\r    That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.\r\rObscure, profound it was, and nebulous,\r    So that by fixing on its depths my sight\r    Nothing whatever I discerned therein.\r\r\xc3\x92Let us descend now into the blind world,\xc3\x93\r    Began the Poet, pallid utterly;\r    \xc3\x92I will be first, and thou shalt second be.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I, who of his colour was aware,\r    Said: \xc3\x92How shall I come, if thou art afraid,\r    Who\xc3\x95rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92The anguish of the people\r    Who are below here in my face depicts\r    That pity which for terror thou hast taken.\r\rLet us go on, for the long way impels us.\xc3\x93\r    Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter\r    The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.\r\rThere, as it seemed to me from listening,\r    Were lamentations none, but only sighs,\r    That tremble made the everlasting air.\r\rAnd this arose from sorrow without torment,\r    Which the crowds had, that many were and great,\r    Of infants and of women and of men.\r\rTo me the Master good: \xc3\x92Thou dost not ask\r    What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?\r    Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,\r\rThat they sinned not; and if they merit had,\r    \xc3\x95Tis not enough, because they had not baptism\r    Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;\r\rAnd if they were before Christianity,\r    In the right manner they adored not God;\r    And among such as these am I myself.\r\rFor such defects, and not for other guilt,\r    Lost are we and are only so far punished,\r    That without hope we live on in desire.\xc3\x93\r\rGreat grief seized on my heart when this I heard,\r    Because some people of much worthiness\r    I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.\r\r\xc3\x92Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,\xc3\x93\r    Began I, with desire of being certain\r    Of that Faith which o\xc3\x95ercometh every error,\r\r\xc3\x92Came any one by his own merit hence,\r    Or by another\xc3\x95s, who was blessed thereafter?\xc3\x93\r    And he, who understood my covert speech,\r\rReplied: \xc3\x92I was a novice in this state,\r    When I saw hither come a Mighty One,\r    With sign of victory incoronate.\r\rHence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,\r    And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,\r    Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient\r\rAbraham, patriarch, and David, king,\r    Israel with his father and his children,\r    And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,\r\rAnd others many, and he made them blessed;\r    And thou must know, that earlier than these\r    Never were any human spirits saved.\xc3\x93\r\rWe ceased not to advance because he spake,\r    But still were passing onward through the forest,\r    The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.\r\rNot very far as yet our way had gone\r    This side the summit, when I saw a fire\r    That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.\r\rWe were a little distant from it still,\r    But not so far that I in part discerned not\r    That honourable people held that place.\r\r\xc3\x92O thou who honourest every art and science,\r    Who may these be, which such great honour have,\r    That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92The honourable name,\r    That sounds of them above there in thy life,\r    Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.\xc3\x93\r\rIn the mean time a voice was heard by me:\r    \xc3\x92All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;\r    His shade returns again, that was departed.\xc3\x93\r\rAfter the voice had ceased and quiet was,\r    Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;\r    Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.\r\rTo say to me began my gracious Master:\r    \xc3\x92Him with that falchion in his hand behold,\r    Who comes before the three, even as their lord.\r\rThat one is Homer, Poet sovereign;\r    He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;\r    The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.\r\rBecause to each of these with me applies\r    The name that solitary voice proclaimed,\r    They do me honour, and in that do well.\xc3\x93\r\rThus I beheld assemble the fair school\r    Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,\r    Who o\xc3\x95er the others like an eagle soars.\r\rWhen they together had discoursed somewhat,\r    They turned to me with signs of salutation,\r    And on beholding this, my Master smiled;\r\rAnd more of honour still, much more, they did me,\r    In that they made me one of their own band;\r    So that the sixth was I, \xc3\x95mid so much wit.\r\rThus we went on as far as to the light,\r    Things saying \xc3\x95tis becoming to keep silent,\r    As was the saying of them where I was.\r\rWe came unto a noble castle\xc3\x95s foot,\r    Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,\r    Defended round by a fair rivulet;\r\rThis we passed over even as firm ground;\r    Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;\r    We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.\r\rPeople were there with solemn eyes and slow,\r    Of great authority in their countenance;\r    They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.\r\rThus we withdrew ourselves upon one side\r    Into an opening luminous and lofty,\r    So that they all of them were visible.\r\rThere opposite, upon the green enamel,\r    Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,\r    Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.\r\rI saw Electra with companions many,\r    \xc3\x95Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,\r    Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;\r\rI saw Camilla and Penthesilea\r    On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,\r    Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;\r\rI saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,\r    Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,\r    And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.\r\rWhen I had lifted up my brows a little,\r    The Master I beheld of those who know,\r    Sit with his philosophic family.\r\rAll gaze upon him, and all do him honour.\r    There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,\r    Who nearer him before the others stand;\r\rDemocritus, who puts the world on chance,\r    Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,\r    Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;\r\rOf qualities I saw the good collector,\r    Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,\r    Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,\r\rEuclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,\r    Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,\r    Averroes, who the great Comment made.\r\rI cannot all of them pourtray in full,\r    Because so drives me onward the long theme,\r    That many times the word comes short of fact.\r\rThe sixfold company in two divides;\r    Another way my sapient Guide conducts me\r    Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;\r\rAnd to a place I come where nothing shines.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto V\r\r\rThus I descended out of the first circle\r    Down to the second, that less space begirds,\r    And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.\r\rThere standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;\r    Examines the transgressions at the entrance;\r    Judges, and sends according as he girds him.\r\rI say, that when the spirit evil-born\r    Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;\r    And this discriminator of transgressions\r\rSeeth what place in Hell is meet for it;\r    Girds himself with his tail as many times\r    As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.\r\rAlways before him many of them stand;\r    They go by turns each one unto the judgment;\r    They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.\r\r\xc3\x92O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry\r    Comest,\xc3\x93 said Minos to me, when he saw me,\r    Leaving the practice of so great an office,\r\r\xc3\x92Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;\r    Let not the portal\xc3\x95s amplitude deceive thee.\xc3\x93\r    And unto him my Guide: \xc3\x92Why criest thou too?\r\rDo not impede his journey fate-ordained;\r    It is so willed there where is power to do\r    That which is willed; and ask no further question.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd now begin the dolesome notes to grow\r    Audible unto me; now am I come\r    There where much lamentation strikes upon me.\r\rI came into a place mute of all light,\r    Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,\r    If by opposing winds \xc3\x95t is combated.\r\rThe infernal hurricane that never rests\r    Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;\r    Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.\r\rWhen they arrive before the precipice,\r    There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,\r    There they blaspheme the puissance divine.\r\rI understood that unto such a torment\r    The carnal malefactors were condemned,\r    Who reason subjugate to appetite.\r\rAnd as the wings of starlings bear them on\r    In the cold season in large band and full,\r    So doth that blast the spirits maledict;\r\rIt hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;\r    No hope doth comfort them for evermore,\r    Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.\r\rAnd as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,\r    Making in air a long line of themselves,\r    So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,\r\rShadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.\r    Whereupon said I: \xc3\x92Master, who are those\r    People, whom the black air so castigates?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92The first of those, of whom intelligence\r    Thou fain wouldst have,\xc3\x93 then said he unto me,\r    \xc3\x92The empress was of many languages.\r\rTo sensual vices she was so abandoned,\r    That lustful she made licit in her law,\r    To remove the blame to which she had been led.\r\rShe is Semiramis, of whom we read\r    That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;\r    She held the land which now the Sultan rules.\r\rThe next is she who killed herself for love,\r    And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;\r    Then Cleopatra the voluptuous.\xc3\x93\r\rHelen I saw, for whom so many ruthless\r    Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,\r    Who at the last hour combated with Love.\r\rParis I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand\r    Shades did he name and point out with his finger,\r    Whom Love had separated from our life.\r\rAfter that I had listened to my Teacher,\r    Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,\r    Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.\r\rAnd I began: \xc3\x92O Poet, willingly\r    Speak would I to those two, who go together,\r    And seem upon the wind to be so light.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd, he to me: \xc3\x92Thou\xc3\x95lt mark, when they shall be\r    Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them\r    By love which leadeth them, and they will come.\xc3\x93\r\rSoon as the wind in our direction sways them,\r    My voice uplift I: \xc3\x92O ye weary souls!\r    Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.\xc3\x93\r\rAs turtle-doves, called onward by desire,\r    With open and steady wings to the sweet nest\r    Fly through the air by their volition borne,\r\rSo came they from the band where Dido is,\r    Approaching us athwart the air malign,\r    So strong was the affectionate appeal.\r\r\xc3\x92O living creature gracious and benignant,\r    Who visiting goest through the purple air\r    Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,\r\rIf were the King of the Universe our friend,\r    We would pray unto him to give thee peace,\r    Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.\r\rOf what it pleases thee to hear and speak,\r    That will we hear, and we will speak to you,\r    While silent is the wind, as it is now.\r\rSitteth the city, wherein I was born,\r    Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends\r    To rest in peace with all his retinue.\r\rLove, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,\r    Seized this man for the person beautiful\r    That was ta\xc3\x95en from me, and still the mode offends me.\r\rLove, that exempts no one beloved from loving,\r    Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,\r    That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;\r\rLove has conducted us unto one death;\r    Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!\xc3\x93\r    These words were borne along from them to us.\r\rAs soon as I had heard those souls tormented,\r    I bowed my face, and so long held it down\r    Until the Poet said to me: \xc3\x92What thinkest?\xc3\x93\r\rWhen I made answer, I began: \xc3\x92Alas!\r    How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,\r    Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!\xc3\x93\r\rThen unto them I turned me, and I spake,\r    And I began: \xc3\x92Thine agonies, Francesca,\r    Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.\r\rBut tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,\r    By what and in what manner Love conceded,\r    That you should know your dubious desires?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd she to me: \xc3\x92There is no greater sorrow\r    Than to be mindful of the happy time\r    In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.\r\rBut, if to recognise the earliest root\r    Of love in us thou hast so great desire,\r    I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.\r\rOne day we reading were for our delight\r    Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.\r    Alone we were and without any fear.\r\rFull many a time our eyes together drew\r    That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;\r    But one point only was it that o\xc3\x95ercame us.\r\rWhen as we read of the much-longed-for smile\r    Being by such a noble lover kissed,\r    This one, who ne\xc3\x95er from me shall be divided,\r\rKissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.\r    Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.\r    That day no farther did we read therein.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd all the while one spirit uttered this,\r    The other one did weep so, that, for pity,\r    I swooned away as if I had been dying,\r\rAnd fell, even as a dead body falls.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto VI\r\r\rAt the return of consciousness, that closed\r    Before the pity of those two relations,\r    Which utterly with sadness had confused me,\r\rNew torments I behold, and new tormented\r    Around me, whichsoever way I move,\r    And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.\r\rIn the third circle am I of the rain\r    Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;\r    Its law and quality are never new.\r\rHuge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,\r    Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;\r    Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.\r\rCerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,\r    With his three gullets like a dog is barking\r    Over the people that are there submerged.\r\rRed eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,\r    And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;\r    He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.\r\rHowl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;\r    One side they make a shelter for the other;\r    Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.\r\rWhen Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!\r     His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;\r     Not a limb had he that was motionless.\r\rAnd my Conductor, with his spans extended,\r    Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,\r    He threw it into those rapacious gullets.\r\rSuch as that dog is, who by barking craves,\r    And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,\r    For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,\r\rThe like became those muzzles filth-begrimed\r    Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders\r    Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.\r\rWe passed across the shadows, which subdues\r    The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet\r    Upon their vanity that person seems.\r\rThey all were lying prone upon the earth,\r    Excepting one, who sat upright as soon\r    As he beheld us passing on before him.\r\r\xc3\x92O thou that art conducted through this Hell,\xc3\x93\r    He said to me, \xc3\x92recall me, if thou canst;\r    Thyself wast made before I was unmade.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92The anguish which thou hast\r    Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,\r    So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.\r\rBut tell me who thou art, that in so doleful\r    A place art put, and in such punishment,\r    If some are greater, none is so displeasing.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Thy city, which is full\r    Of envy so that now the sack runs over,\r    Held me within it in the life serene.\r\rYou citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;\r    For the pernicious sin of gluttony\r    I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.\r\rAnd I, sad soul, am not the only one,\r    For all these suffer the like penalty\r    For the like sin;\xc3\x93 and word no more spake he.\r\rI answered him: \xc3\x92Ciacco, thy wretchedness\r    Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;\r    But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come\r\rThe citizens of the divided city;\r    If any there be just; and the occasion\r    Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92They, after long contention,\r    Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party\r    Will drive the other out with much offence.\r\rThen afterwards behoves it this one fall\r    Within three suns, and rise again the other\r    By force of him who now is on the coast.\r\rHigh will it hold its forehead a long while,\r    Keeping the other under heavy burdens,\r    Howe\xc3\x95er it weeps thereat and is indignant.\r\rThe just are two, and are not understood there;\r    Envy and Arrogance and Avarice\r    Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.\xc3\x93\r\rHere ended he his tearful utterance;\r    And I to him: \xc3\x92I wish thee still to teach me,\r    And make a gift to me of further speech.\r\rFarinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,\r    Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,\r    And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,\r\rSay where they are, and cause that I may know them;\r    For great desire constraineth me to learn\r    If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he: \xc3\x92They are among the blacker souls;\r    A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;\r    If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.\r\rBut when thou art again in the sweet world,\r    I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;\r    No more I tell thee and no more I answer.\xc3\x93\r\rThen his straightforward eyes he turned askance,\r    Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;\r    He fell therewith prone like the other blind.\r\rAnd the Guide said to me: \xc3\x92He wakes no more\r    This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;\r    When shall approach the hostile Potentate,\r\rEach one shall find again his dismal tomb,\r    Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,\r    Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes.\xc3\x93\r\rSo we passed onward o\xc3\x95er the filthy mixture\r    Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,\r    Touching a little on the future life.\r\rWherefore I said: \xc3\x92Master, these torments here,\r    Will they increase after the mighty sentence,\r    Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Return unto thy science,\r    Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,\r    The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.\r\rAlbeit that this people maledict\r    To true perfection never can attain,\r    Hereafter more than now they look to be.\xc3\x93\r\rRound in a circle by that road we went,\r    Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;\r    We came unto the point where the descent is;\r\rThere we found Plutus the great enemy.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto VII\r\r\r\xc3\x92Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!\xc3\x93\r    Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;\r    And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,\r\rSaid, to encourage me: \xc3\x92Let not thy fear\r    Harm thee; for any power that he may have\r    Shall not prevent thy going down this crag.\xc3\x93\r\rThen he turned round unto that bloated lip,\r    And said: \xc3\x92Be silent, thou accursed wolf;\r    Consume within thyself with thine own rage.\r\rNot causeless is this journey to the abyss;\r    Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought\r    Vengeance upon the proud adultery.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as the sails inflated by the wind\r    Involved together fall when snaps the mast,\r    So fell the cruel monster to the earth.\r\rThus we descended into the fourth chasm,\r    Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore\r    Which all the woe of the universe insacks.\r\rJustice of God, ah! who heaps up so many\r    New toils and sufferings as I beheld?\r    And why doth our transgression waste us so?\r\rAs doth the billow there upon Charybdis,\r    That breaks itself on that which it encounters,\r    So here the folk must dance their roundelay.\r\rHere saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,\r    On one side and the other, with great howls,\r    Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.\r\rThey clashed together, and then at that point\r    Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,\r    Crying, \xc3\x92Why keepest?\xc3\x93 and, \xc3\x92Why squanderest thou?\xc3\x93\r\rThus they returned along the lurid circle\r    On either hand unto the opposite point,\r    Shouting their shameful metre evermore.\r\rThen each, when he arrived there, wheeled about\r    Through his half-circle to another joust;\r    And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,\r\rExclaimed: \xc3\x92My Master, now declare to me\r    What people these are, and if all were clerks,\r    These shaven crowns upon the left of us.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92All of them were asquint\r    In intellect in the first life, so much\r    That there with measure they no spending made.\r\rClearly enough their voices bark it forth,\r    Whene\xc3\x95er they reach the two points of the circle,\r    Where sunders them the opposite defect.\r\rClerks those were who no hairy covering\r    Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,\r    In whom doth Avarice practise its excess.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92My Master, among such as these\r    I ought forsooth to recognise some few,\r    Who were infected with these maladies.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Vain thought thou entertainest;\r    The undiscerning life which made them sordid\r    Now makes them unto all discernment dim.\r\rForever shall they come to these two buttings;\r    These from the sepulchre shall rise again\r    With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.\r\rIll giving and ill keeping the fair world\r    Have ta\xc3\x95en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;\r    Whate\xc3\x95er it be, no words adorn I for it.\r\rNow canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce\r    Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,\r    For which the human race each other buffet;\r\rFor all the gold that is beneath the moon,\r    Or ever has been, of these weary souls\r    Could never make a single one repose.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Master,\xc3\x93 I said to him, \xc3\x92now tell me also\r    What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,\r    That has the world\xc3\x95s goods so within its clutches?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92O creatures imbecile,\r    What ignorance is this which doth beset you?\r    Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.\r\rHe whose omniscience everything transcends\r    The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,\r    That every part to every part may shine,\r\rDistributing the light in equal measure;\r    He in like manner to the mundane splendours\r    Ordained a general ministress and guide,\r\rThat she might change at times the empty treasures\r    From race to race, from one blood to another,\r    Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.\r\rTherefore one people triumphs, and another\r    Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,\r    Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.\r\rYour knowledge has no counterstand against her;\r    She makes provision, judges, and pursues\r    Her governance, as theirs the other gods.\r\rHer permutations have not any truce;\r    Necessity makes her precipitate,\r    So often cometh who his turn obtains.\r\rAnd this is she who is so crucified\r    Even by those who ought to give her praise,\r    Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.\r\rBut she is blissful, and she hears it not;\r    Among the other primal creatures gladsome\r    She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.\r\rLet us descend now unto greater woe;\r    Already sinks each star that was ascending\r    When I set out, and loitering is forbidden.\xc3\x93\r\rWe crossed the circle to the other bank,\r    Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself\r    Along a gully that runs out of it.\r\rThe water was more sombre far than perse;\r    And we, in company with the dusky waves,\r    Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.\r\rA marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,\r    This tristful brooklet, when it has descended\r    Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.\r\rAnd I, who stood intent upon beholding,\r    Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,\r    All of them naked and with angry look.\r\rThey smote each other not alone with hands,\r    But with the head and with the breast and feet,\r    Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.\r\rSaid the good Master: \xc3\x92Son, thou now beholdest\r    The souls of those whom anger overcame;\r    And likewise I would have thee know for certain\r\rBeneath the water people are who sigh\r    And make this water bubble at the surface,\r    As the eye tells thee wheresoe\xc3\x95er it turns.\r\rFixed in the mire they say, \xc3\x94We sullen were\r    In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,\r    Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;\r\rNow we are sullen in this sable mire.\xc3\x95\r    This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,\r    For with unbroken words they cannot say it.\xc3\x93\r\rThus we went circling round the filthy fen\r    A great arc \xc3\x95twixt the dry bank and the swamp,\r    With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;\r\rUnto the foot of a tower we came at last.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto VIII\r\r\rI say, continuing, that long before\r    We to the foot of that high tower had come,\r    Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,\r\rBy reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,\r    And from afar another answer them,\r    So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.\r\rAnd, to the sea of all discernment turned,\r    I said: \xc3\x92What sayeth this, and what respondeth\r    That other fire? and who are they that made it?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Across the turbid waves\r    What is expected thou canst now discern,\r    If reek of the morass conceal it not.\xc3\x93\r\rCord never shot an arrow from itself\r    That sped away athwart the air so swift,\r    As I beheld a very little boat\r\rCome o\xc3\x95er the water tow\xc3\x95rds us at that moment,\r    Under the guidance of a single pilot,\r    Who shouted, \xc3\x92Now art thou arrived, fell soul?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain\r    For this once,\xc3\x93 said my Lord; \xc3\x92thou shalt not have us\r    Longer than in the passing of the slough.\xc3\x93\r\rAs he who listens to some great deceit\r    That has been done to him, and then resents it,\r    Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.\r\rMy Guide descended down into the boat,\r    And then he made me enter after him,\r    And only when I entered seemed it laden.\r\rSoon as the Guide and I were in the boat,\r    The antique prow goes on its way, dividing\r    More of the water than \xc3\x95tis wont with others.\r\rWhile we were running through the dead canal,\r    Uprose in front of me one full of mire,\r    And said, \xc3\x92Who \xc3\x95rt thou that comest ere the hour?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92Although I come, I stay not;\r    But who art thou that hast become so squalid?\xc3\x93\r    \xc3\x92Thou seest that I am one who weeps,\xc3\x93 he answered.\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92With weeping and with wailing,\r    Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;\r    For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.\xc3\x93\r\rThen stretched he both his hands unto the boat;\r    Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,\r    Saying, \xc3\x92Away there with the other dogs!\xc3\x93\r\rThereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;\r    He kissed my face, and said: \xc3\x92Disdainful soul,\r    Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.\r\rThat was an arrogant person in the world;\r    Goodness is none, that decks his memory;\r    So likewise here his shade is furious.\r\rHow many are esteemed great kings up there,\r    Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,\r    Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92My Master, much should I be pleased,\r    If I could see him soused into this broth,\r    Before we issue forth out of the lake.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Ere unto thee the shore\r    Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;\r    Such a desire \xc3\x95tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.\xc3\x93\r\rA little after that, I saw such havoc\r    Made of him by the people of the mire,\r    That still I praise and thank my God for it.\r\rThey all were shouting, \xc3\x92At Philippo Argenti!\xc3\x93\r    And that exasperate spirit Florentine\r    Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.\r\rWe left him there, and more of him I tell not;\r    But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,\r    Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.\r\rAnd the good Master said: \xc3\x92Even now, my Son,\r    The city draweth near whose name is Dis,\r    With the grave citizens, with the great throng.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92Its mosques already, Master, clearly\r    Within there in the valley I discern\r    Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire\r\rThey were.\xc3\x93  And he to me: \xc3\x92The fire eternal\r    That kindles them within makes them look red,\r    As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.\xc3\x93\r\rThen we arrived within the moats profound,\r    That circumvallate that disconsolate city;\r    The walls appeared to me to be of iron.\r\rNot without making first a circuit wide,\r    We came unto a place where loud the pilot\r    Cried out to us, \xc3\x92Debark, here is the entrance.\xc3\x93\r\rMore than a thousand at the gates I saw\r    Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily\r    Were saying, \xc3\x92Who is this that without death\r\rGoes through the kingdom of the people dead?\xc3\x93\r    And my sagacious Master made a sign\r    Of wishing secretly to speak with them.\r\rA little then they quelled their great disdain,\r    And said: \xc3\x92Come thou alone, and he begone\r    Who has so boldly entered these dominions.\r\rLet him return alone by his mad road;\r    Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,\r    Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.\xc3\x93\r\rThink, Reader, if I was discomforted\r    At utterance of the accursed words;\r    For never to return here I believed.\r\r\xc3\x92O my dear Guide, who more than seven times\r    Hast rendered me security, and drawn me\r    From imminent peril that before me stood,\r\rDo not desert me,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92thus undone;\r    And if the going farther be denied us,\r    Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd that Lord, who had led me thitherward,\r    Said unto me: \xc3\x92Fear not; because our passage\r    None can take from us, it by Such is given.\r\rBut here await me, and thy weary spirit\r    Comfort and nourish with a better hope;\r    For in this nether world I will not leave thee.\xc3\x93\r\rSo onward goes and there abandons me\r    My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,\r    For No and Yes within my head contend.\r\rI could not hear what he proposed to them;\r    But with them there he did not linger long,\r    Ere each within in rivalry ran back.\r\rThey closed the portals, those our adversaries,\r    On my Lord\xc3\x95s breast, who had remained without\r    And turned to me with footsteps far between.\r\rHis eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he\r    Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,\r    \xc3\x92Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd unto me: \xc3\x92Thou, because I am angry,\r    Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,\r    Whatever for defence within be planned.\r\rThis arrogance of theirs is nothing new;\r    For once they used it at less secret gate,\r    Which finds itself without a fastening still.\r\rO\xc3\x95er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;\r    And now this side of it descends the steep,\r    Passing across the circles without escort,\r\rOne by whose means the city shall be opened.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto IX\r\r\rThat hue which cowardice brought out on me,\r    Beholding my Conductor backward turn,\r    Sooner repressed within him his new colour.\r\rHe stopped attentive, like a man who listens,\r    Because the eye could not conduct him far\r    Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.\r\r\xc3\x92Still it behoveth us to win the fight,\xc3\x93\r    Began he; \xc3\x92Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .\r    O how I long that some one here arrive!\xc3\x93\r\rWell I perceived, as soon as the beginning\r    He covered up with what came afterward,\r    That they were words quite different from the first;\r\rBut none the less his saying gave me fear,\r    Because I carried out the broken phrase,\r    Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.\r\r\xc3\x92Into this bottom of the doleful conch\r    Doth any e\xc3\x95er descend from the first grade,\r    Which for its pain has only hope cut off?\xc3\x93\r\rThis question put I; and he answered me:\r    \xc3\x92Seldom it comes to pass that one of us\r    Maketh the journey upon which I go.\r\rTrue is it, once before I here below\r    Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,\r    Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.\r\rNaked of me short while the flesh had been,\r    Before within that wall she made me enter,\r    To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;\r\rThat is the lowest region and the darkest,\r    And farthest from the heaven which circles all.\r    Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.\r\rThis fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,\r    Encompasses about the city dolent,\r    Where now we cannot enter without anger.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd more he said, but not in mind I have it;\r    Because mine eye had altogether drawn me\r    Tow\xc3\x95rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,\r\rWhere in a moment saw I swift uprisen\r    The three infernal Furies stained with blood,\r    Who had the limbs of women and their mien,\r\rAnd with the greenest hydras were begirt;\r    Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,\r    Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.\r\rAnd he who well the handmaids of the Queen\r    Of everlasting lamentation knew,\r    Said unto me: \xc3\x92Behold the fierce Erinnys.\r\rThis is Megaera, on the left-hand side;\r    She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;\r    Tisiphone is between;\xc3\x93 and then was silent.\r\rEach one her breast was rending with her nails;\r    They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,\r    That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.\r\r\xc3\x92Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!\xc3\x93\r    All shouted looking down; \xc3\x92in evil hour\r    Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,\r    For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,\r    No more returning upward would there be.\xc3\x93\r\rThus said the Master; and he turned me round\r    Himself, and trusted not unto my hands\r    So far as not to blind me with his own.\r\rO ye who have undistempered intellects,\r    Observe the doctrine that conceals itself\r    Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!\r\rAnd now there came across the turbid waves\r    The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,\r    Because of which both of the margins trembled;\r\rNot otherwise it was than of a wind\r    Impetuous on account of adverse heats,\r    That smites the forest, and, without restraint,\r\rThe branches rends, beats down, and bears away;\r    Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,\r    And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.\r\rMine eyes he loosed, and said: \xc3\x92Direct the nerve\r    Of vision now along that ancient foam,\r    There yonder where that smoke is most intense.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as the frogs before the hostile serpent\r    Across the water scatter all abroad,\r    Until each one is huddled in the earth.\r\rMore than a thousand ruined souls I saw,\r    Thus fleeing from before one who on foot\r    Was passing o\xc3\x95er the Styx with soles unwet.\r\rFrom off his face he fanned that unctuous air,\r    Waving his left hand oft in front of him,\r    And only with that anguish seemed he weary.\r\rWell I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,\r    And to the Master turned; and he made sign\r    That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.\r\rAh! how disdainful he appeared to me!\r    He reached the gate, and with a little rod\r    He opened it, for there was no resistance.\r\r\xc3\x92O banished out of Heaven, people despised!\xc3\x93\r    Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;\r    \xc3\x92Whence is this arrogance within you couched?\r\rWherefore recalcitrate against that will,\r    From which the end can never be cut off,\r    And which has many times increased your pain?\r\rWhat helpeth it to butt against the fates?\r    Your Cerberus, if you remember well,\r    For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled.\xc3\x93\r\rThen he returned along the miry road,\r    And spake no word to us, but had the look\r    Of one whom other care constrains and goads\r\rThan that of him who in his presence is;\r    And we our feet directed tow\xc3\x95rds the city,\r    After those holy words all confident.\r\rWithin we entered without any contest;\r    And I, who inclination had to see\r    What the condition such a fortress holds,\r\rSoon as I was within, cast round mine eye,\r    And see on every hand an ample plain,\r    Full of distress and torment terrible.\r\rEven as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,\r    Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,\r    That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,\r\rThe sepulchres make all the place uneven;\r    So likewise did they there on every side,\r    Saving that there the manner was more bitter;\r\rFor flames between the sepulchres were scattered,\r    By which they so intensely heated were,\r    That iron more so asks not any art.\r\rAll of their coverings uplifted were,\r    And from them issued forth such dire laments,\r    Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92My Master, what are all those people\r    Who, having sepulture within those tombs,\r    Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Here are the Heresiarchs,\r    With their disciples of all sects, and much\r    More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.\r\rHere like together with its like is buried;\r    And more and less the monuments are heated.\xc3\x93\r    And when he to the right had turned, we passed\r\rBetween the torments and high parapets.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto X\r\r\rNow onward goes, along a narrow path\r    Between the torments and the city wall,\r    My Master, and I follow at his back.\r\r\xc3\x92O power supreme, that through these impious circles\r    Turnest me,\xc3\x93 I began, \xc3\x92as pleases thee,\r    Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;\r\rThe people who are lying in these tombs,\r    Might they be seen? already are uplifted\r    The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92They all will be closed up\r    When from Jehoshaphat they shall return\r    Here with the bodies they have left above.\r\rTheir cemetery have upon this side\r    With Epicurus all his followers,\r    Who with the body mortal make the soul;\r\rBut in the question thou dost put to me,\r    Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,\r    And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92Good Leader, I but keep concealed\r    From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,\r    Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire\r    Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,\r    Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.\r\rThy mode of speaking makes thee manifest\r    A native of that noble fatherland,\r    To which perhaps I too molestful was.\xc3\x93\r\rUpon a sudden issued forth this sound\r    From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,\r    Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.\r\rAnd unto me he said: \xc3\x92Turn thee; what dost thou?\r    Behold there Farinata who has risen;\r    From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.\xc3\x93\r\rI had already fixed mine eyes on his,\r    And he uprose erect with breast and front\r    E\xc3\x95en as if Hell he had in great despite.\r\rAnd with courageous hands and prompt my Leader\r    Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,\r    Exclaiming, \xc3\x92Let thy words explicit be.\xc3\x93\r\rAs soon as I was at the foot of his tomb\r    Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,\r    Then asked of me, \xc3\x92Who were thine ancestors?\xc3\x93\r\rI, who desirous of obeying was,\r    Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;\r    Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.\r\rThen said he: \xc3\x92Fiercely adverse have they been\r    To me, and to my fathers, and my party;\r    So that two several times I scattered them.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92If they were banished, they returned on all sides,\xc3\x93\r    I answered him, \xc3\x92the first time and the second;\r    But yours have not acquired that art aright.\xc3\x93\r\rThen there uprose upon the sight, uncovered\r    Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;\r    I think that he had risen on his knees.\r\rRound me he gazed, as if solicitude\r    He had to see if some one else were with me,\r    But after his suspicion was all spent,\r\rWeeping, he said to me: \xc3\x92If through this blind\r    Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,\r    Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92I come not of myself;\r    He who is waiting yonder leads me here,\r    Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.\xc3\x93\r\rHis language and the mode of punishment\r    Already unto me had read his name;\r    On that account my answer was so full.\r\rUp starting suddenly, he cried out: \xc3\x92How\r    Saidst thou,\xc3\x91he had?  Is he not still alive?\r    Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?\xc3\x93\r\rWhen he became aware of some delay,\r    Which I before my answer made, supine\r    He fell again, and forth appeared no more.\r\rBut the other, magnanimous, at whose desire\r    I had remained, did not his aspect change,\r    Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.\r\r\xc3\x92And if,\xc3\x93 continuing his first discourse,\r    \xc3\x92They have that art,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92not learned aright,\r    That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.\r\rBut fifty times shall not rekindled be\r    The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,\r    Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;\r\rAnd as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,\r    Say why that people is so pitiless\r    Against my race in each one of its laws?\xc3\x93\r\rWhence I to him: \xc3\x92The slaughter and great carnage\r    Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause\r    Such orisons in our temple to be made.\xc3\x93\r\rAfter his head he with a sigh had shaken,\r    \xc3\x92There I was not alone,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92nor surely\r    Without a cause had with the others moved.\r\rBut there I was alone, where every one\r    Consented to the laying waste of Florence,\r    He who defended her with open face.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,\xc3\x93\r    I him entreated, \xc3\x92solve for me that knot,\r    Which has entangled my conceptions here.\r\rIt seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,\r    Beforehand whatsoe\xc3\x95er time brings with it,\r    And in the present have another mode.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92We see, like those who have imperfect sight,\r    The things,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92that distant are from us;\r    So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.\r\rWhen they draw near, or are, is wholly vain\r    Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,\r    Not anything know we of your human state.\r\rHence thou canst understand, that wholly dead\r    Will be our knowledge from the moment when\r    The portal of the future shall be closed.\xc3\x93\r\rThen I, as if compunctious for my fault,\r    Said: \xc3\x92Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,\r    That still his son is with the living joined.\r\rAnd if just now, in answering, I was dumb,\r    Tell him I did it because I was thinking\r    Already of the error you have solved me.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd now my Master was recalling me,\r    Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit\r    That he would tell me who was with him there.\r\rHe said: \xc3\x92With more than a thousand here I lie;\r    Within here is the second Frederick,\r    And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.\xc3\x93\r\rThereon he hid himself; and I towards\r    The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting\r    Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.\r\rHe moved along; and afterward thus going,\r    He said to me, \xc3\x92Why art thou so bewildered?\xc3\x93\r    And I in his inquiry satisfied him.\r\r\xc3\x92Let memory preserve what thou hast heard\r    Against thyself,\xc3\x93 that Sage commanded me,\r    \xc3\x92And now attend here;\xc3\x93 and he raised his finger.\r\r\xc3\x92When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet\r    Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,\r    From her thou\xc3\x95lt know the journey of thy life.\xc3\x93\r\rUnto the left hand then he turned his feet;\r    We left the wall, and went towards the middle,\r    Along a path that strikes into a valley,\r\rWhich even up there unpleasant made its stench.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XI\r\r\rUpon the margin of a lofty bank\r    Which great rocks broken in a circle made,\r    We came upon a still more cruel throng;\r\rAnd there, by reason of the horrible\r    Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,\r    We drew ourselves aside behind the cover\r\rOf a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,\r    Which said: \xc3\x92Pope Anastasius I hold,\r    Whom out of the right way Photinus drew.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Slow it behoveth our descent to be,\r    So that the sense be first a little used\r    To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it.\xc3\x93\r\rThe Master thus; and unto him I said,\r    \xc3\x92Some compensation find, that the time pass not\r    Idly;\xc3\x93 and he: \xc3\x92Thou seest I think of that.\r\rMy son, upon the inside of these rocks,\xc3\x93\r    Began he then to say, \xc3\x92are three small circles,\r    From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.\r\rThey all are full of spirits maledict;\r    But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,\r    Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.\r\rOf every malice that wins hate in Heaven,\r    Injury is the end; and all such end\r    Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.\r\rBut because fraud is man\xc3\x95s peculiar vice,\r    More it displeases God; and so stand lowest\r    The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.\r\rAll the first circle of the Violent is;\r    But since force may be used against three persons,\r    In three rounds \xc3\x95tis divided and constructed.\r\rTo God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we\r    Use force; I say on them and on their things,\r    As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.\r\rA death by violence, and painful wounds,\r    Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance\r    Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;\r\rWhence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,\r    Marauders, and freebooters, the first round\r    Tormenteth all in companies diverse.\r\rMan may lay violent hands upon himself\r    And his own goods; and therefore in the second\r    Round must perforce without avail repent\r\rWhoever of your world deprives himself,\r    Who games, and dissipates his property,\r    And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.\r\rViolence can be done the Deity,\r    In heart denying and blaspheming Him,\r    And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.\r\rAnd for this reason doth the smallest round\r    Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,\r    And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.\r\rFraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,\r    A man may practise upon him who trusts,\r    And him who doth no confidence imburse.\r\rThis latter mode, it would appear, dissevers\r    Only the bond of love which Nature makes;\r    Wherefore within the second circle nestle\r\rHypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,\r    Falsification, theft, and simony,\r    Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.\r\rBy the other mode, forgotten is that love\r    Which Nature makes, and what is after added,\r    From which there is a special faith engendered.\r\rHence in the smallest circle, where the point is\r    Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,\r    Whoe\xc3\x95er betrays for ever is consumed.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92My Master, clear enough proceeds\r    Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes\r    This cavern and the people who possess it.\r\rBut tell me, those within the fat lagoon,\r    Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,\r    And who encounter with such bitter tongues,\r\rWherefore are they inside of the red city\r    Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,\r    And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd unto me he said: \xc3\x92Why wanders so\r    Thine intellect from that which it is wont?\r    Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?\r\rHast thou no recollection of those words\r    With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses\r    The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,\xc3\x91\r\rIncontinence, and Malice, and insane\r    Bestiality? and how Incontinence\r    Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?\r\rIf thou regardest this conclusion well,\r    And to thy mind recallest who they are\r    That up outside are undergoing penance,\r\rClearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons\r    They separated are, and why less wroth\r    Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,\r    Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,\r    That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!\r\rOnce more a little backward turn thee,\xc3\x93 said I,\r    \xc3\x92There where thou sayest that usury offends\r    Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Philosophy,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92to him who heeds it,\r    Noteth, not only in one place alone,\r    After what manner Nature takes her course\r\rFrom Intellect Divine, and from its art;\r    And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,\r    After not many pages shalt thou find,\r\rThat this your art as far as possible\r    Follows, as the disciple doth the master;\r    So that your art is, as it were, God\xc3\x95s grandchild.\r\rFrom these two, if thou bringest to thy mind\r    Genesis at the beginning, it behoves\r    Mankind to gain their life and to advance;\r\rAnd since the usurer takes another way,\r    Nature herself and in her follower\r    Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.\r\rBut follow, now, as I would fain go on,\r    For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,\r    And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,\r\rAnd far beyond there we descend the crag.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XII\r\r\rThe place where to descend the bank we came\r    Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,\r    Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.\r\rSuch as that ruin is which in the flank\r    Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,\r    Either by earthquake or by failing stay,\r\rFor from the mountain\xc3\x95s top, from which it moved,\r    Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,\r    Some path \xc3\x95twould give to him who was above;\r\rEven such was the descent of that ravine,\r    And on the border of the broken chasm\r    The infamy of Crete was stretched along,\r\rWho was conceived in the fictitious cow;\r    And when he us beheld, he bit himself,\r    Even as one whom anger racks within.\r\rMy Sage towards him shouted: \xc3\x92Peradventure\r    Thou think\xc3\x95st that here may be the Duke of Athens,\r    Who in the world above brought death to thee?\r\rGet thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not\r    Instructed by thy sister, but he comes\r    In order to behold your punishments.\xc3\x93\r\rAs is that bull who breaks loose at the moment\r    In which he has received the mortal blow,\r    Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,\r\rThe Minotaur beheld I do the like;\r    And he, the wary, cried: \xc3\x92Run to the passage;\r    While he wroth, \xc3\x95tis well thou shouldst descend.\xc3\x93\r\rThus down we took our way o\xc3\x95er that discharge\r    Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves\r    Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.\r\rThoughtful I went; and he said: \xc3\x92Thou art thinking\r    Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded\r    By that brute anger which just now I quenched.\r\rNow will I have thee know, the other time\r    I here descended to the nether Hell,\r    This precipice had not yet fallen down.\r\rBut truly, if I well discern, a little\r    Before His coming who the mighty spoil\r    Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,\r\rUpon all sides the deep and loathsome valley\r    Trembled so, that I thought the Universe\r    Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think\r\rThe world ofttimes converted into chaos;\r    And at that moment this primeval crag\r    Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.\r\rBut fix thine eyes below; for draweth near\r    The river of blood, within which boiling is\r    Whoe\xc3\x95er by violence doth injure others.\xc3\x93\r\rO blind cupidity, O wrath insane,\r    That spurs us onward so in our short life,\r    And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!\r\rI saw an ample moat bent like a bow,\r    As one which all the plain encompasses,\r    Conformable to what my Guide had said.\r\rAnd between this and the embankment\xc3\x95s foot\r    Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,\r    As in the world they used the chase to follow.\r\rBeholding us descend, each one stood still,\r    And from the squadron three detached themselves,\r    With bows and arrows in advance selected;\r\rAnd from afar one cried: \xc3\x92Unto what torment\r    Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?\r    Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.\xc3\x93\r\rMy Master said: \xc3\x92Our answer will we make\r    To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,\r    That will of thine was evermore so hasty.\xc3\x93\r\rThen touched he me, and said: \xc3\x92This one is Nessus,\r    Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,\r    And for himself, himself did vengeance take.\r\rAnd he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,\r    Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;\r    That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.\r\rThousands and thousands go about the moat\r    Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges\r    Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.\xc3\x93\r\rNear we approached unto those monsters fleet;\r    Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch\r    Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.\r\rAfter he had uncovered his great mouth,\r    He said to his companions: \xc3\x92Are you ware\r    That he behind moveth whate\xc3\x95er he touches?\r\rThus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.\xc3\x93\r    And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,\r    Where the two natures are together joined,\r\rReplied: \xc3\x92Indeed he lives, and thus alone\r    Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;\r    Necessity, and not delight, impels us.\r\rSome one withdrew from singing Halleluja,\r    Who unto me committed this new office;\r    No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.\r\rBut by that virtue through which I am moving\r    My steps along this savage thoroughfare,\r    Give us some one of thine, to be with us,\r\rAnd who may show us where to pass the ford,\r    And who may carry this one on his back;\r    For \xc3\x95tis no spirit that can walk the air.\xc3\x93\r\rUpon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,\r    And said to Nessus: \xc3\x92Turn and do thou guide them,\r    And warn aside, if other band may meet you.\xc3\x93\r\rWe with our faithful escort onward moved\r    Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,\r    Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.\r\rPeople I saw within up to the eyebrows,\r    And the great Centaur said: \xc3\x92Tyrants are these,\r    Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.\r\rHere they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here\r    Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius\r    Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.\r\rThat forehead there which has the hair so black\r    Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,\r    Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,\r\rUp in the world was by his stepson slain.\xc3\x93\r    Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,\r    \xc3\x92Now he be first to thee, and second I.\xc3\x93\r\rA little farther on the Centaur stopped\r    Above a folk, who far down as the throat\r    Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.\r\rA shade he showed us on one side alone,\r    Saying: \xc3\x92He cleft asunder in God\xc3\x95s bosom\r    The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.\xc3\x93\r\rThen people saw I, who from out the river\r    Lifted their heads and also all the chest;\r    And many among these I recognised.\r\rThus ever more and more grew shallower\r    That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;\r    And there across the moat our passage was.\r\r\xc3\x92Even as thou here upon this side beholdest\r    The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,\xc3\x93\r    The Centaur said, \xc3\x92I wish thee to believe\r\rThat on this other more and more declines\r    Its bed, until it reunites itself\r    Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.\r\rJustice divine, upon this side, is goading\r    That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,\r    And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks\r\rThe tears which with the boiling it unseals\r    In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,\r    Who made upon the highways so much war.\xc3\x93\r\rThen back he turned, and passed again the ford.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XIII\r\r\rNot yet had Nessus reached the other side,\r    When we had put ourselves within a wood,\r    That was not marked by any path whatever.\r\rNot foliage green, but of a dusky colour,\r    Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,\r    Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.\r\rSuch tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,\r    Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold\r    \xc3\x95Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.\r\rThere do the hideous Harpies make their nests,\r    Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,\r    With sad announcement of impending doom;\r\rBroad wings have they, and necks and faces human,\r    And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;\r    They make laments upon the wondrous trees.\r\rAnd the good Master: \xc3\x92Ere thou enter farther,\r    Know that thou art within the second round,\xc3\x93\r    Thus he began to say, \xc3\x92and shalt be, till\r\rThou comest out upon the horrible sand;\r    Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see\r    Things that will credence give unto my speech.\xc3\x93\r\rI heard on all sides lamentations uttered,\r    And person none beheld I who might make them,\r    Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.\r\rI think he thought that I perhaps might think\r    So many voices issued through those trunks\r    From people who concealed themselves from us;\r\rTherefore the Master said: \xc3\x92If thou break off\r    Some little spray from any of these trees,\r    The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain.\xc3\x93\r\rThen stretched I forth my hand a little forward,\r    And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;\r    And the trunk cried, \xc3\x92Why dost thou mangle me?\xc3\x93\r\rAfter it had become embrowned with blood,\r    It recommenced its cry: \xc3\x92Why dost thou rend me?\r    Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?\r\rMen once we were, and now are changed to trees;\r    Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,\r    Even if the souls of serpents we had been.\xc3\x93\r\rAs out of a green brand, that is on fire\r    At one of the ends, and from the other drips\r    And hisses with the wind that is escaping;\r\rSo from that splinter issued forth together\r    Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip\r    Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.\r\r\xc3\x92Had he been able sooner to believe,\xc3\x93\r    My Sage made answer, \xc3\x92O thou wounded soul,\r    What only in my verses he has seen,\r\rNot upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;\r    Whereas the thing incredible has caused me\r    To put him to an act which grieveth me.\r\rBut tell him who thou wast, so that by way\r    Of some amends thy fame he may refresh\r    Up in the world, to which he can return.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd the trunk said: \xc3\x92So thy sweet words allure me,\r    I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,\r    That I a little to discourse am tempted.\r\rI am the one who both keys had in keeping\r    Of Frederick\xc3\x95s heart, and turned them to and fro\r    So softly in unlocking and in locking,\r\rThat from his secrets most men I withheld;\r    Fidelity I bore the glorious office\r    So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.\r\rThe courtesan who never from the dwelling\r    Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,\r    Death universal and the vice of courts,\r\rInflamed against me all the other minds,\r    And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,\r    That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.\r\rMy spirit, in disdainful exultation,\r    Thinking by dying to escape disdain,\r    Made me unjust against myself, the just.\r\rI, by the roots unwonted of this wood,\r    Do swear to you that never broke I faith\r    Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;\r\rAnd to the world if one of you return,\r    Let him my memory comfort, which is lying\r    Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.\xc3\x93\r\rWaited awhile, and then: \xc3\x92Since he is silent,\xc3\x93\r    The Poet said to me, \xc3\x92lose not the time,\r    But speak, and question him, if more may please thee.\xc3\x93\r\rWhence I to him: \xc3\x92Do thou again inquire\r    Concerning what thou thinks\xc3\x95t will satisfy me;\r    For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.\xc3\x93\r\rTherefore he recommenced: \xc3\x92So may the man\r    Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,\r    Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased\r\rTo tell us in what way the soul is bound\r    Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,\r    If any from such members e\xc3\x95er is freed.\xc3\x93\r\rThen blew the trunk amain, and afterward\r    The wind was into such a voice converted:\r    \xc3\x92With brevity shall be replied to you.\r\rWhen the exasperated soul abandons\r    The body whence it rent itself away,\r    Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.\r\rIt falls into the forest, and no part\r    Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,\r    There like a grain of spelt it germinates.\r\rIt springs a sapling, and a forest tree;\r    The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,\r    Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.\r\rLike others for our spoils shall we return;\r    But not that any one may them revest,\r    For \xc3\x95tis not just to have what one casts off.\r\rHere we shall drag them, and along the dismal\r    Forest our bodies shall suspended be,\r    Each to the thorn of his molested shade.\xc3\x93\r\rWe were attentive still unto the trunk,\r    Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,\r    When by a tumult we were overtaken,\r\rIn the same way as he is who perceives\r    The boar and chase approaching to his stand,\r    Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;\r\rAnd two behold! upon our left-hand side,\r    Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,\r    That of the forest, every fan they broke.\r\rHe who was in advance: \xc3\x92Now help, Death, help!\xc3\x93\r    And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,\r    Was shouting: \xc3\x92Lano, were not so alert\r\rThose legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!\xc3\x93\r    And then, perchance because his breath was failing,\r    He grouped himself together with a bush.\r\rBehind them was the forest full of black\r    She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot\r    As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.\r\rOn him who had crouched down they set their teeth,\r    And him they lacerated piece by piece,\r    Thereafter bore away those aching members.\r\rThereat my Escort took me by the hand,\r    And led me to the bush, that all in vain\r    Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.\r\r\xc3\x92O Jacopo,\xc3\x93 it said, \xc3\x92of Sant\xc3\x95 Andrea,\r    What helped it thee of me to make a screen?\r    What blame have I in thy nefarious life?\xc3\x93\r\rWhen near him had the Master stayed his steps,\r    He said: \xc3\x92Who wast thou, that through wounds so many\r    Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to us: \xc3\x92O souls, that hither come\r    To look upon the shameful massacre\r    That has so rent away from me my leaves,\r\rGather them up beneath the dismal bush;\r    I of that city was which to the Baptist\r    Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this\r\rForever with his art will make it sad.\r    And were it not that on the pass of Arno\r    Some glimpses of him are remaining still,\r\rThose citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it\r    Upon the ashes left by Attila,\r    In vain had caused their labour to be done.\r\rOf my own house I made myself a gibbet.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XIV\r\r\rBecause the charity of my native place\r    Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,\r    And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.\r\rThen came we to the confine, where disparted\r    The second round is from the third, and where\r    A horrible form of Justice is beheld.\r\rClearly to manifest these novel things,\r    I say that we arrived upon a plain,\r    Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;\r\rThe dolorous forest is a garland to it\r    All round about, as the sad moat to that;\r    There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.\r\rThe soil was of an arid and thick sand,\r    Not of another fashion made than that\r    Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.\r\rVengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou\r    By each one to be dreaded, who doth read\r    That which was manifest unto mine eyes!\r\rOf naked souls beheld I many herds,\r    Who all were weeping very miserably,\r    And over them seemed set a law diverse.\r\rSupine upon the ground some folk were lying;\r    And some were sitting all drawn up together,\r    And others went about continually.\r\rThose who were going round were far the more,\r    And those were less who lay down to their torment,\r    But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.\r\rO\xc3\x95er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,\r    Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,\r    As of the snow on Alp without a wind.\r\rAs Alexander, in those torrid parts\r    Of India, beheld upon his host\r    Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.\r\rWhence he provided with his phalanxes\r    To trample down the soil, because the vapour\r    Better extinguished was while it was single;\r\rThus was descending the eternal heat,\r    Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder\r    Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.\r\rWithout repose forever was the dance\r    Of miserable hands, now there, now here,\r    Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.\r\r\xc3\x92Master,\xc3\x93 began I, \xc3\x92thou who overcomest\r    All things except the demons dire, that issued\r    Against us at the entrance of the gate,\r\rWho is that mighty one who seems to heed not\r    The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,\r    So that the rain seems not to ripen him?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he himself, who had become aware\r    That I was questioning my Guide about him,\r    Cried: \xc3\x92Such as I was living, am I, dead.\r\rIf Jove should weary out his smith, from whom\r    He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,\r    Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,\r\rAnd if he wearied out by turns the others\r    In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,\r    Vociferating, \xc3\x94Help, good Vulcan, help!\xc3\x95\r\rEven as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,\r    And shot his bolts at me with all his might,\r    He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.\xc3\x93\r\rThen did my Leader speak with such great force,\r    That I had never heard him speak so loud:\r    \xc3\x92O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished\r\rThine arrogance, thou punished art the more;\r    Not any torment, saving thine own rage,\r    Would be unto thy fury pain complete.\xc3\x93\r\rThen he turned round to me with better lip,\r    Saying: \xc3\x92One of the Seven Kings was he\r    Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold\r\rGod in disdain, and little seems to prize him;\r    But, as I said to him, his own despites\r    Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.\r\rNow follow me, and mind thou do not place\r    As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,\r    But always keep them close unto the wood.\xc3\x93\r\rSpeaking no word, we came to where there gushes\r    Forth from the wood a little rivulet,\r    Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.\r\rAs from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,\r    The sinful women later share among them,\r    So downward through the sand it went its way.\r\rThe bottom of it, and both sloping banks,\r    Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;\r    Whence I perceived that there the passage was.\r\r\xc3\x92In all the rest which I have shown to thee\r    Since we have entered in within the gate\r    Whose threshold unto no one is denied,\r\rNothing has been discovered by thine eyes\r    So notable as is the present river,\r    Which all the little flames above it quenches.\xc3\x93\r\rThese words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him\r    That he would give me largess of the food,\r    For which he had given me largess of desire.\r\r\xc3\x92In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,\xc3\x93\r    Said he thereafterward, \xc3\x92whose name is Crete,\r    Under whose king the world of old was chaste.\r\rThere is a mountain there, that once was glad\r    With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;\r    Now \xc3\x95tis deserted, as a thing worn out.\r\rRhea once chose it for the faithful cradle\r    Of her own son; and to conceal him better,\r    Whene\xc3\x95er he cried, she there had clamours made.\r\rA grand old man stands in the mount erect,\r    Who holds his shoulders turned tow\xc3\x95rds Damietta,\r    And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.\r\rHis head is fashioned of refined gold,\r    And of pure silver are the arms and breast;\r    Then he is brass as far down as the fork.\r\rFrom that point downward all is chosen iron,\r    Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,\r    And more he stands on that than on the other.\r\rEach part, except the gold, is by a fissure\r    Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,\r    Which gathered together perforate that cavern.\r\rFrom rock to rock they fall into this valley;\r    Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;\r    Then downward go along this narrow sluice\r\rUnto that point where is no more descending.\r    They form Cocytus; what that pool may be\r    Thou shalt behold, so here \xc3\x95tis not narrated.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92If so the present runnel\r    Doth take its rise in this way from our world,\r    Why only on this verge appears it to us?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Thou knowest the place is round,\r    And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,\r    Still to the left descending to the bottom,\r\rThou hast not yet through all the circle turned.\r    Therefore if something new appear to us,\r    It should not bring amazement to thy face.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I again: \xc3\x92Master, where shall be found\r    Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou\xc3\x95rt silent,\r    And sayest the other of this rain is made?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,\xc3\x93\r    Replied he; \xc3\x92but the boiling of the red\r    Water might well solve one of them thou makest.\r\rThou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,\r    There where the souls repair to lave themselves,\r    When sin repented of has been removed.\xc3\x93\r\rThen said he: \xc3\x92It is time now to abandon\r    The wood; take heed that thou come after me;\r    A way the margins make that are not burning,\r\rAnd over them all vapours are extinguished.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XV\r\r\rNow bears us onward one of the hard margins,\r    And so the brooklet\xc3\x95s mist o\xc3\x95ershadows it,\r    From fire it saves the water and the dikes.\r\rEven as the Flemings, \xc3\x95twixt Cadsand and Bruges,\r    Fearing the flood that tow\xc3\x95rds them hurls itself,\r    Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;\r\rAnd as the Paduans along the Brenta,\r    To guard their villas and their villages,\r    Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;\r\rIn such similitude had those been made,\r    Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,\r    Whoever he might be, the master made them.\r\rNow were we from the forest so remote,\r    I could not have discovered where it was,\r    Even if backward I had turned myself,\r\rWhen we a company of souls encountered,\r    Who came beside the dike, and every one\r    Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont\r\rTo eye each other under a new moon,\r    And so towards us sharpened they their brows\r    As an old tailor at the needle\xc3\x95s eye.\r\rThus scrutinised by such a family,\r    By some one I was recognised, who seized\r    My garment\xc3\x95s hem, and cried out, \xc3\x92What a marvel!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,\r    On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,\r    That the scorched countenance prevented not\r\rHis recognition by my intellect;\r    And bowing down my face unto his own,\r    I made reply, \xc3\x92Are you here, Ser Brunetto?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he: \xc3\x92May\xc3\x95t not displease thee, O my son,\r    If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini\r    Backward return and let the trail go on.\xc3\x93\r\rI said to him: \xc3\x92With all my power I ask it;\r    And if you wish me to sit down with you,\r    I will, if he please, for I go with him.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O son,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92whoever of this herd\r    A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,\r    Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.\r\rTherefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,\r    And afterward will I rejoin my band,\r    Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.\xc3\x93\r\rI did not dare to go down from the road\r    Level to walk with him; but my head bowed\r    I held as one who goeth reverently.\r\rAnd he began: \xc3\x92What fortune or what fate\r    Before the last day leadeth thee down here?\r    And who is this that showeth thee the way?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Up there above us in the life serene,\xc3\x93\r    I answered him, \xc3\x92I lost me in a valley,\r    Or ever yet my age had been completed.\r\rBut yestermorn I turned my back upon it;\r    This one appeared to me, returning thither,\r    And homeward leadeth me along this road.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92If thou thy star do follow,\r    Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,\r    If well I judged in the life beautiful.\r\rAnd if I had not died so prematurely,\r    Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,\r    I would have given thee comfort in the work.\r\rBut that ungrateful and malignant people,\r    Which of old time from Fesole descended,\r    And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,\r\rWill make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;\r    And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs\r    It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.\r\rOld rumour in the world proclaims them blind;\r    A people avaricious, envious, proud;\r    Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.\r\rThy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,\r    One party and the other shall be hungry\r    For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.\r\rTheir litter let the beasts of Fesole\r    Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,\r    If any still upon their dunghill rise,\r\rIn which may yet revive the consecrated\r    Seed of those Romans, who remained there when\r    The nest of such great malice it became.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,\xc3\x93\r    Replied I to him, \xc3\x92not yet would you be\r    In banishment from human nature placed;\r\rFor in my mind is fixed, and touches now\r    My heart the dear and good paternal image\r    Of you, when in the world from hour to hour\r\rYou taught me how a man becomes eternal;\r    And how much I am grateful, while I live\r    Behoves that in my language be discerned.\r\rWhat you narrate of my career I write,\r    And keep it to be glossed with other text\r    By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.\r\rThis much will I have manifest to you;\r    Provided that my conscience do not chide me,\r    For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.\r\rSuch handsel is not new unto mine ears;\r    Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around\r    As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.\xc3\x93\r\rMy Master thereupon on his right cheek\r    Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;\r    Then said: \xc3\x92He listeneth well who noteth it.\xc3\x93\r\rNor speaking less on that account, I go\r    With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are\r    His most known and most eminent companions.\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92To know of some is well;\r    Of others it were laudable to be silent,\r    For short would be the time for so much speech.\r\rKnow them in sum, that all of them were clerks,\r    And men of letters great and of great fame,\r    In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.\r\rPriscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,\r    And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there\r    If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,\r\rThat one, who by the Servant of the Servants\r    From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,\r    Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.\r\rMore would I say, but coming and discoursing\r    Can be no longer; for that I behold\r    New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.\r\rA people comes with whom I may not be;\r    Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,\r    In which I still live, and no more I ask.\xc3\x93\r\rThen he turned round, and seemed to be of those\r    Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle\r    Across the plain; and seemed to be among them\r\rThe one who wins, and not the one who loses.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XVI\r\r\rNow was I where was heard the reverberation\r    Of water falling into the next round,\r    Like to that humming which the beehives make,\r\rWhen shadows three together started forth,\r    Running, from out a company that passed\r    Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.\r\rTowards us came they, and each one cried out:\r    \xc3\x92Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest\r    To be some one of our depraved city.\xc3\x93\r\rAh me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,\r    Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!\r    It pains me still but to remember it.\r\rUnto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;\r    He turned his face towards me, and \xc3\x92Now wait,\xc3\x93\r    He said; \xc3\x92to these we should be courteous.\r\rAnd if it were not for the fire that darts\r    The nature of this region, I should say\r    That haste were more becoming thee than them.\xc3\x93\r\rAs soon as we stood still, they recommenced\r    The old refrain, and when they overtook us,\r    Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.\r\rAs champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,\r    Watching for their advantage and their hold,\r    Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,\r\rThus, wheeling round, did every one his visage\r    Direct to me, so that in opposite wise\r    His neck and feet continual journey made.\r\rAnd, \xc3\x92If the misery of this soft place\r    Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,\xc3\x93\r    Began one, \xc3\x92and our aspect black and blistered,\r\rLet the renown of us thy mind incline\r    To tell us who thou art, who thus securely\r    Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.\r\rHe in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,\r    Naked and skinless though he now may go,\r    Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;\r\rHe was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;\r    His name was Guidoguerra, and in life\r    Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.\r\rThe other, who close by me treads the sand,\r    Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame\r    Above there in the world should welcome be.\r\rAnd I, who with them on the cross am placed,\r    Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly\r    My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.\xc3\x93\r\rCould I have been protected from the fire,\r    Below I should have thrown myself among them,\r    And think the Teacher would have suffered it;\r\rBut as I should have burned and baked myself,\r    My terror overmastered my good will,\r    Which made me greedy of embracing them.\r\rThen I began: \xc3\x92Sorrow and not disdain\r    Did your condition fix within me so,\r    That tardily it wholly is stripped off,\r\rAs soon as this my Lord said unto me\r    Words, on account of which I thought within me\r    That people such as you are were approaching.\r\rI of your city am; and evermore\r    Your labours and your honourable names\r    I with affection have retraced and heard.\r\rI leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits\r    Promised to me by the veracious Leader;\r    But to the centre first I needs must plunge.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92So may the soul for a long while conduct\r    Those limbs of thine,\xc3\x93 did he make answer then,\r    \xc3\x92And so may thy renown shine after thee,\r\rValour and courtesy, say if they dwell\r    Within our city, as they used to do,\r    Or if they wholly have gone out of it;\r\rFor Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment\r    With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,\r    Doth greatly mortify us with his words.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,\r    Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,\r    Florence, so that thou weep\xc3\x95st thereat already!\xc3\x93\r\rIn this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;\r    And the three, taking that for my reply,\r    Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.\r\r\xc3\x92If other times so little it doth cost thee,\xc3\x93\r    Replied they all, \xc3\x92to satisfy another,\r    Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!\r\rTherefore, if thou escape from these dark places,\r    And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,\r    When it shall pleasure thee to say, \xc3\x94I was,\xc3\x95\r\rSee that thou speak of us unto the people.\xc3\x93\r    Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight\r    It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.\r\rNot an Amen could possibly be said\r    So rapidly as they had disappeared;\r    Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.\r\rI followed him, and little had we gone,\r    Before the sound of water was so near us,\r    That speaking we should hardly have been heard.\r\rEven as that stream which holdeth its own course\r    The first from Monte Veso tow\xc3\x95rds the East,\r    Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,\r\rWhich is above called Acquacheta, ere\r    It down descendeth into its low bed,\r    And at Forli is vacant of that name,\r\rReverberates there above San Benedetto\r    From Alps, by falling at a single leap,\r    Where for a thousand there were room enough;\r\rThus downward from a bank precipitate,\r    We found resounding that dark-tinted water,\r    So that it soon the ear would have offended.\r\rI had a cord around about me girt,\r    And therewithal I whilom had designed\r    To take the panther with the painted skin.\r\rAfter I this had all from me unloosed,\r    As my Conductor had commanded me,\r    I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,\r\rWhereat he turned himself to the right side,\r    And at a little distance from the verge,\r    He cast it down into that deep abyss.\r\r\xc3\x92It must needs be some novelty respond,\xc3\x93\r    I said within myself, \xc3\x92to the new signal\r    The Master with his eye is following so.\xc3\x93\r\rAh me! how very cautious men should be\r    With those who not alone behold the act,\r    But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!\r\rHe said to me: \xc3\x92Soon there will upward come\r    What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming\r    Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight.\xc3\x93\r\rAye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,\r    A man should close his lips as far as may be,\r    Because without his fault it causes shame;\r\rBut here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes\r    Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,\r    So may they not be void of lasting favour,\r\rAthwart that dense and darksome atmosphere\r    I saw a figure swimming upward come,\r    Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,\r\rEven as he returns who goeth down\r    Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled\r    Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,\r\rWho upward stretches, and draws in his feet.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XVII\r\r\r\xc3\x92Behold the monster with the pointed tail,\r    Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,\r    Behold him who infecteth all the world.\xc3\x93\r\rThus unto me my Guide began to say,\r    And beckoned him that he should come to shore,\r    Near to the confine of the trodden marble;\r\rAnd that uncleanly image of deceit\r    Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,\r    But on the border did not drag its tail.\r\rThe face was as the face of a just man,\r    Its semblance outwardly was so benign,\r    And of a serpent all the trunk beside.\r\rTwo paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;\r    The back, and breast, and both the sides it had\r    Depicted o\xc3\x95er with nooses and with shields.\r\rWith colours more, groundwork or broidery\r    Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,\r    Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.\r\rAs sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,\r    That part are in the water, part on land;\r    And as among the guzzling Germans there,\r\rThe beaver plants himself to wage his war;\r    So that vile monster lay upon the border,\r    Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.\r\rHis tail was wholly quivering in the void,\r    Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,\r    That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.\r\rThe Guide said: \xc3\x92Now perforce must turn aside\r    Our way a little, even to that beast\r    Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him.\xc3\x93\r\rWe therefore on the right side descended,\r    And made ten steps upon the outer verge,\r    Completely to avoid the sand and flame;\r\rAnd after we are come to him, I see\r    A little farther off upon the sand\r    A people sitting near the hollow place.\r\rThen said to me the Master: \xc3\x92So that full\r    Experience of this round thou bear away,\r    Now go and see what their condition is.\r\rThere let thy conversation be concise;\r    Till thou returnest I will speak with him,\r    That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders.\xc3\x93\r\rThus farther still upon the outermost\r    Head of that seventh circle all alone\r    I went, where sat the melancholy folk.\r\rOut of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;\r    This way, that way, they helped them with their hands\r    Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.\r\rNot otherwise in summer do the dogs,\r    Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when\r    By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.\r\rWhen I had turned mine eyes upon the faces\r    Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,\r    Not one of them I knew; but I perceived\r\rThat from the neck of each there hung a pouch,\r    Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;\r    And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.\r\rAnd as I gazing round me come among them,\r    Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw\r    That had the face and posture of a lion.\r\rProceeding then the current of my sight,\r    Another of them saw I, red as blood,\r    Display a goose more white than butter is.\r\rAnd one, who with an azure sow and gravid\r    Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,\r    Said unto me: \xc3\x92What dost thou in this moat?\r\rNow get thee gone; and since thou\xc3\x95rt still alive,\r    Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,\r    Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.\r\rA Paduan am I with these Florentines;\r    Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,\r    Exclaiming, \xc3\x94Come the sovereign cavalier,\r\rHe who shall bring the satchel with three goats;\xc3\x95\xc3\x93\r    Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust\r    His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.\r\rAnd fearing lest my longer stay might vex\r    Him who had warned me not to tarry long,\r    Backward I turned me from those weary souls.\r\rI found my Guide, who had already mounted\r    Upon the back of that wild animal,\r    And said to me: \xc3\x92Now be both strong and bold.\r\rNow we descend by stairways such as these;\r    Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,\r    So that the tail may have no power to harm thee.\xc3\x93\r\rSuch as he is who has so near the ague\r    Of quartan that his nails are blue already,\r    And trembles all, but looking at the shade;\r\rEven such became I at those proffered words;\r    But shame in me his menaces produced,\r    Which maketh servant strong before good master.\r\rI seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;\r    I wished to say, and yet the voice came not\r    As I believed, \xc3\x92Take heed that thou embrace me.\xc3\x93\r\rBut he, who other times had rescued me\r    In other peril, soon as I had mounted,\r    Within his arms encircled and sustained me,\r\rAnd said: \xc3\x92Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;\r    The circles large, and the descent be little;\r    Think of the novel burden which thou hast.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as the little vessel shoves from shore,\r    Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;\r    And when he wholly felt himself afloat,\r\rThere where his breast had been he turned his tail,\r    And that extended like an eel he moved,\r    And with his paws drew to himself the air.\r\rA greater fear I do not think there was\r    What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,\r    Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;\r\rNor when the wretched Icarus his flanks\r    Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,\r    His father crying, \xc3\x92An ill way thou takest!\xc3\x93\r\rThan was my own, when I perceived myself\r    On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished\r    The sight of everything but of the monster.\r\rOnward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;\r    Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only\r    By wind upon my face and from below.\r\rI heard already on the right the whirlpool\r    Making a horrible crashing under us;\r    Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.\r\rThen was I still more fearful of the abyss;\r    Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,\r    Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.\r\rI saw then, for before I had not seen it,\r    The turning and descending, by great horrors\r    That were approaching upon divers sides.\r\rAs falcon who has long been on the wing,\r    Who, without seeing either lure or bird,\r    Maketh the falconer say, \xc3\x92Ah me, thou stoopest,\xc3\x93\r\rDescendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,\r    Thorough a hundred circles, and alights\r    Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;\r\rEven thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,\r    Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,\r    And being disencumbered of our persons,\r\rHe sped away as arrow from the string.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XVIII\r\r\rThere is a place in Hell called Malebolge,\r    Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,\r    As is the circle that around it turns.\r\rRight in the middle of the field malign\r    There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,\r    Of which its place the structure will recount.\r\rRound, then, is that enclosure which remains\r    Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,\r    And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.\r\rAs where for the protection of the walls\r    Many and many moats surround the castles,\r    The part in which they are a figure forms,\r\rJust such an image those presented there;\r    And as about such strongholds from their gates\r    Unto the outer bank are little bridges,\r\rSo from the precipice\xc3\x95s base did crags\r    Project, which intersected dikes and moats,\r    Unto the well that truncates and collects them.\r\rWithin this place, down shaken from the back\r    Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet\r    Held to the left, and I moved on behind.\r\rUpon my right hand I beheld new anguish,\r    New torments, and new wielders of the lash,\r    Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.\r\rDown at the bottom were the sinners naked;\r    This side the middle came they facing us,\r    Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;\r\rEven as the Romans, for the mighty host,\r    The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,\r    Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;\r\rFor all upon one side towards the Castle\r    Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter\xc3\x95s;\r    On the other side they go towards the Mountain.\r\rThis side and that, along the livid stone\r    Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,\r    Who cruelly were beating them behind.\r\rAh me! how they did make them lift their legs\r    At the first blows! and sooth not any one\r    The second waited for, nor for the third.\r\rWhile I was going on, mine eyes by one\r    Encountered were; and straight I said: \xc3\x92Already\r    With sight of this one I am not unfed.\xc3\x93\r\rTherefore I stayed my feet to make him out,\r    And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,\r    And to my going somewhat back assented;\r\rAnd he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,\r    Lowering his face, but little it availed him;\r    For said I: \xc3\x92Thou that castest down thine eyes,\r\rIf false are not the features which thou bearest,\r    Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;\r    But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Unwillingly I tell it;\r    But forces me thine utterance distinct,\r    Which makes me recollect the ancient world.\r\rI was the one who the fair Ghisola\r    Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,\r    Howe\xc3\x95er the shameless story may be told.\r\rNot the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;\r    Nay, rather is this place so full of them,\r    That not so many tongues to-day are taught\r\r\xc3\x95Twixt Reno and Savena to say \xc3\x94sipa;\xc3\x95\r    And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,\r    Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.\xc3\x93\r\rWhile speaking in this manner, with his scourge\r    A demon smote him, and said: \xc3\x92Get thee gone\r    Pander, there are no women here for coin.\xc3\x93\r\rI joined myself again unto mine Escort;\r    Thereafterward with footsteps few we came\r    To where a crag projected from the bank.\r\rThis very easily did we ascend,\r    And turning to the right along its ridge,\r    From those eternal circles we departed.\r\rWhen we were there, where it is hollowed out\r    Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,\r    The Guide said: \xc3\x92Wait, and see that on thee strike\r\rThe vision of those others evil-born,\r    Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,\r    Because together with us they have gone.\xc3\x93\r\rFrom the old bridge we looked upon the train\r    Which tow\xc3\x95rds us came upon the other border,\r    And which the scourges in like manner smite.\r\rAnd the good Master, without my inquiring,\r    Said to me: \xc3\x92See that tall one who is coming,\r    And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;\r\rStill what a royal aspect he retains!\r    That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning\r    The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.\r\rHe by the isle of Lemnos passed along\r    After the daring women pitiless\r    Had unto death devoted all their males.\r\rThere with his tokens and with ornate words\r    Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden\r    Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.\r\rThere did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;\r    Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,\r    And also for Medea is vengeance done.\r\rWith him go those who in such wise deceive;\r    And this sufficient be of the first valley\r    To know, and those that in its jaws it holds.\xc3\x93\r\rWe were already where the narrow path\r    Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms\r    Of that a buttress for another arch.\r\rThence we heard people, who are making moan\r    In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,\r    And with their palms beating upon themselves\r\rThe margins were incrusted with a mould\r    By exhalation from below, that sticks there,\r    And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.\r\rThe bottom is so deep, no place suffices\r    To give us sight of it, without ascending\r    The arch\xc3\x95s back, where most the crag impends.\r\rThither we came, and thence down in the moat\r    I saw a people smothered in a filth\r    That out of human privies seemed to flow;\r\rAnd whilst below there with mine eye I search,\r    I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,\r    It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.\r\rHe screamed to me: \xc3\x92Wherefore art thou so eager\r    To look at me more than the other foul ones?\xc3\x93\r    And I to him: \xc3\x92Because, if I remember,\r\rI have already seen thee with dry hair,\r    And thou\xc3\x95rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;\r    Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:\r    \xc3\x92The flatteries have submerged me here below,\r    Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.\xc3\x93\r\rThen said to me the Guide: \xc3\x92See that thou thrust\r    Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,\r    That with thine eyes thou well the face attain\r\rOf that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,\r    Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,\r    And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.\r\rThais the harlot is it, who replied\r    Unto her paramour, when he said, \xc3\x94Have I\r    Great gratitude from thee?\xc3\x95\xc3\x91\xc3\x94Nay, marvellous;\xc3\x95\r\rAnd herewith let our sight be satisfied.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XIX\r\r\rO Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,\r    Ye who the things of God, which ought to be\r    The brides of holiness, rapaciously\r\rFor silver and for gold do prostitute,\r    Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,\r    Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.\r\rWe had already on the following tomb\r    Ascended to that portion of the crag\r    Which o\xc3\x95er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.\r\rWisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest\r    In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,\r    And with what justice doth thy power distribute!\r\rI saw upon the sides and on the bottom\r    The livid stone with perforations filled,\r    All of one size, and every one was round.\r\rTo me less ample seemed they not, nor greater\r    Than those that in my beautiful Saint John\r    Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,\r\rAnd one of which, not many years ago,\r    I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;\r    Be this a seal all men to undeceive.\r\rOut of the mouth of each one there protruded\r    The feet of a transgressor, and the legs\r    Up to the calf, the rest within remained.\r\rIn all of them the soles were both on fire;\r    Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,\r    They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.\r\rEven as the flame of unctuous things is wont\r    To move upon the outer surface only,\r    So likewise was it there from heel to point.\r\r\xc3\x92Master, who is that one who writhes himself,\r    More than his other comrades quivering,\xc3\x93\r    I said, \xc3\x92and whom a redder flame is sucking?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92If thou wilt have me bear thee\r    Down there along that bank which lowest lies,\r    From him thou\xc3\x95lt know his errors and himself.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;\r    Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not\r    From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.\xc3\x93\r\rStraightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;\r    We turned, and on the left-hand side descended\r    Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.\r\rAnd the good Master yet from off his haunch\r    Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me\r    Of him who so lamented with his shanks.\r\r\xc3\x92Whoe\xc3\x95er thou art, that standest upside down,\r    O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,\xc3\x93\r    To say began I, \xc3\x92if thou canst, speak out.\xc3\x93\r\rI stood even as the friar who is confessing\r    The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,\r    Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.\r\rAnd he cried out: \xc3\x92Dost thou stand there already,\r    Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?\r    By many years the record lied to me.\r\rArt thou so early satiate with that wealth,\r    For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud\r    The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?\xc3\x93\r\rSuch I became, as people are who stand,\r    Not comprehending what is answered them,\r    As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.\r\rThen said Virgilius: \xc3\x92Say to him straightway,\r    \xc3\x94I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.\xc3\x95\xc3\x93\r    And I replied as was imposed on me.\r\rWhereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,\r    Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation\r    Said to me: \xc3\x92Then what wantest thou of me?\r\rIf who I am thou carest so much to know,\r    That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,\r    Know that I vested was with the great mantle;\r\rAnd truly was I son of the She-bear,\r    So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth\r    Above, and here myself, I pocketed.\r\rBeneath my head the others are dragged down\r    Who have preceded me in simony,\r    Flattened along the fissure of the rock.\r\rBelow there I shall likewise fall, whenever\r    That one shall come who I believed thou wast,\r    What time the sudden question I proposed.\r\rBut longer I my feet already toast,\r    And here have been in this way upside down,\r    Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;\r\rFor after him shall come of fouler deed\r    From tow\xc3\x95rds the west a Pastor without law,\r    Such as befits to cover him and me.\r\rNew Jason will he be, of whom we read\r    In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,\r    So he who governs France shall be to this one.\xc3\x93\r\rI do not know if I were here too bold,\r    That him I answered only in this metre:\r    \xc3\x92I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure\r\rOur Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,\r    Before he put the keys into his keeping?\r    Truly he nothing asked but \xc3\x94Follow me.\xc3\x95\r\rNor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias\r    Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen\r    Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.\r\rTherefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,\r    And keep safe guard o\xc3\x95er the ill-gotten money,\r    Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.\r\rAnd were it not that still forbids it me\r    The reverence for the keys superlative\r    Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,\r\rI would make use of words more grievous still;\r    Because your avarice afflicts the world,\r    Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.\r\rThe Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,\r    When she who sitteth upon many waters\r    To fornicate with kings by him was seen;\r\rThe same who with the seven heads was born,\r    And power and strength from the ten horns received,\r    So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.\r\rYe have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;\r    And from the idolater how differ ye,\r    Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?\r\rAh, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,\r    Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower\r    Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd while I sang to him such notes as these,\r    Either that anger or that conscience stung him,\r    He struggled violently with both his feet.\r\rI think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,\r    With such contented lip he listened ever\r    Unto the sound of the true words expressed.\r\rTherefore with both his arms he took me up,\r    And when he had me all upon his breast,\r    Remounted by the way where he descended.\r\rNor did he tire to have me clasped to him;\r    But bore me to the summit of the arch\r    Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.\r\rThere tenderly he laid his burden down,\r    Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,\r    That would have been hard passage for the goats:\r\rThence was unveiled to me another valley.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XX\r\r\rOf a new pain behoves me to make verses\r    And give material to the twentieth canto\r    Of the first song, which is of the submerged.\r\rI was already thoroughly disposed\r    To peer down into the uncovered depth,\r    Which bathed itself with tears of agony;\r\rAnd people saw I through the circular valley,\r    Silent and weeping, coming at the pace\r    Which in this world the Litanies assume.\r\rAs lower down my sight descended on them,\r    Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted\r    From chin to the beginning of the chest;\r\rFor tow\xc3\x95rds the reins the countenance was turned,\r    And backward it behoved them to advance,\r    As to look forward had been taken from them.\r\rPerchance indeed by violence of palsy\r    Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;\r    But I ne\xc3\x95er saw it, nor believe it can be.\r\rAs God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit\r    From this thy reading, think now for thyself\r    How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,\r\rWhen our own image near me I beheld\r    Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes\r    Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.\r\rTruly I wept, leaning upon a peak\r    Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said\r    To me: \xc3\x92Art thou, too, of the other fools?\r\rHere pity lives when it is wholly dead;\r    Who is a greater reprobate than he\r    Who feels compassion at the doom divine?\r\rLift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom\r    Opened the earth before the Thebans\xc3\x95 eyes;\r    Wherefore they all cried: \xc3\x94Whither rushest thou,\r\rAmphiaraus?  Why dost leave the war?\xc3\x95\r    And downward ceased he not to fall amain\r    As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.\r\rSee, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!\r    Because he wished to see too far before him\r    Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:\r\rBehold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,\r    When from a male a female he became,\r    His members being all of them transformed;\r\rAnd afterwards was forced to strike once more\r    The two entangled serpents with his rod,\r    Ere he could have again his manly plumes.\r\rThat Aruns is, who backs the other\xc3\x95s belly,\r    Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs\r    The Carrarese who houses underneath,\r\rAmong the marbles white a cavern had\r    For his abode; whence to behold the stars\r    And sea, the view was not cut off from him.\r\rAnd she there, who is covering up her breasts,\r    Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,\r    And on that side has all the hairy skin,\r\rWas Manto, who made quest through many lands,\r    Afterwards tarried there where I was born;\r    Whereof I would thou list to me a little.\r\rAfter her father had from life departed,\r    And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,\r    She a long season wandered through the world.\r\rAbove in beauteous Italy lies a lake\r    At the Alp\xc3\x95s foot that shuts in Germany\r    Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.\r\rBy a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,\r    \xc3\x95Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,\r    With water that grows stagnant in that lake.\r\rMidway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,\r    And he of Brescia, and the Veronese\r    Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.\r\rSitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,\r    To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,\r    Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.\r\rThere of necessity must fall whatever\r    In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,\r    And grows a river down through verdant pastures.\r\rSoon as the water doth begin to run,\r    No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,\r    Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.\r\rNot far it runs before it finds a plain\r    In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,\r    And oft \xc3\x95tis wont in summer to be sickly.\r\rPassing that way the virgin pitiless\r    Land in the middle of the fen descried,\r    Untilled and naked of inhabitants;\r\rThere to escape all human intercourse,\r    She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise\r    And lived, and left her empty body there.\r\rThe men, thereafter, who were scattered round,\r    Collected in that place, which was made strong\r    By the lagoon it had on every side;\r\rThey built their city over those dead bones,\r    And, after her who first the place selected,\r    Mantua named it, without other omen.\r\rIts people once within more crowded were,\r    Ere the stupidity of Casalodi\r    From Pinamonte had received deceit.\r\rTherefore I caution thee, if e\xc3\x95er thou hearest\r    Originate my city otherwise,\r    No falsehood may the verity defraud.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92My Master, thy discourses are\r    To me so certain, and so take my faith,\r    That unto me the rest would be spent coals.\r\rBut tell me of the people who are passing,\r    If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,\r    For only unto that my mind reverts.\xc3\x93\r\rThen said he to me: \xc3\x92He who from the cheek\r    Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders\r    Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,\r\rSo that there scarce remained one in the cradle,\r    An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,\r    In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.\r\rEryphylus his name was, and so sings\r    My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;\r    That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.\r\rThe next, who is so slender in the flanks,\r    Was Michael Scott, who of a verity\r    Of magical illusions knew the game.\r\rBehold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,\r    Who now unto his leather and his thread\r    Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.\r\rBehold the wretched ones, who left the needle,\r    The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;\r    They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.\r\rBut come now, for already holds the confines\r    Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville\r    Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,\r\rAnd yesternight the moon was round already;\r    Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee\r    From time to time within the forest deep.\xc3\x93\r\rThus spake he to me, and we walked the while.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXI\r\r\rFrom bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things\r    Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,\r    We came along, and held the summit, when\r\rWe halted to behold another fissure\r    Of Malebolge and other vain laments;\r    And I beheld it marvellously dark.\r\rAs in the Arsenal of the Venetians\r    Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch\r    To smear their unsound vessels o\xc3\x95er again,\r\rFor sail they cannot; and instead thereof\r    One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks\r    The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;\r\rOne hammers at the prow, one at the stern,\r    This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,\r    Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;\r\rThus, not by fire, but by the art divine,\r    Was boiling down below there a dense pitch\r    Which upon every side the bank belimed.\r\rI saw it, but I did not see within it\r    Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,\r    And all swell up and resubside compressed.\r\rThe while below there fixedly I gazed,\r    My Leader, crying out: \xc3\x92Beware, beware!\xc3\x93\r    Drew me unto himself from where I stood.\r\rThen I turned round, as one who is impatient\r    To see what it behoves him to escape,\r    And whom a sudden terror doth unman,\r\rWho, while he looks, delays not his departure;\r    And I beheld behind us a black devil,\r    Running along upon the crag, approach.\r\rAh, how ferocious was he in his aspect!\r    And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,\r    With open wings and light upon his feet!\r\rHis shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,\r    A sinner did encumber with both haunches,\r    And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.\r\rFrom off our bridge, he said: \xc3\x92O Malebranche,\r    Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;\r    Plunge him beneath, for I return for others\r\rUnto that town, which is well furnished with them.\r    All there are barrators, except Bonturo;\r    No into Yes for money there is changed.\xc3\x93\r\rHe hurled him down, and over the hard crag\r    Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened\r    In so much hurry to pursue a thief.\r\rThe other sank, and rose again face downward;\r    But the demons, under cover of the bridge,\r    Cried: \xc3\x92Here the Santo Volto has no place!\r\rHere swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;\r    Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,\r    Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.\xc3\x93\r\rThey seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;\r    They said: \xc3\x92It here behoves thee to dance covered,\r    That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.\xc3\x93\r\rNot otherwise the cooks their scullions make\r    Immerse into the middle of the caldron\r    The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.\r\rSaid the good Master to me: \xc3\x92That it be not\r    Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down\r    Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;\r\rAnd for no outrage that is done to me\r    Be thou afraid, because these things I know,\r    For once before was I in such a scuffle.\xc3\x93\r\rThen he passed on beyond the bridge\xc3\x95s head,\r    And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,\r    Need was for him to have a steadfast front.\r\rWith the same fury, and the same uproar,\r    As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,\r    Who on a sudden begs, where\xc3\x95er he stops,\r\rThey issued from beneath the little bridge,\r    And turned against him all their grappling-irons;\r    But he cried out: \xc3\x92Be none of you malignant!\r\rBefore those hooks of yours lay hold of me,\r    Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,\r    And then take counsel as to grappling me.\xc3\x93\r\rThey all cried out: \xc3\x92Let Malacoda go;\xc3\x93\r    Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,\r    And he came to him, saying: \xc3\x92What avails it?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me\r    Advanced into this place,\xc3\x93 my Master said,\r    \xc3\x92Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,\r\rWithout the will divine, and fate auspicious?\r    Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed\r    That I another show this savage road.\xc3\x93\r\rThen was his arrogance so humbled in him,\r    That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,\r    And to the others said: \xc3\x92Now strike him not.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd unto me my Guide: \xc3\x92O thou, who sittest\r    Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,\r    Securely now return to me again.\xc3\x93\r\rWherefore I started and came swiftly to him;\r    And all the devils forward thrust themselves,\r    So that I feared they would not keep their compact.\r\rAnd thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers\r    Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,\r    Seeing themselves among so many foes.\r\rClose did I press myself with all my person\r    Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes\r    From off their countenance, which was not good.\r\rThey lowered their rakes, and \xc3\x92Wilt thou have me hit him,\xc3\x93\r    They said to one another, \xc3\x92on the rump?\xc3\x93\r    And answered: \xc3\x92Yes; see that thou nick him with it.\xc3\x93\r\rBut the same demon who was holding parley\r    With my Conductor turned him very quickly,\r    And said: \xc3\x92Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;\xc3\x93\r\rThen said to us: \xc3\x92You can no farther go\r    Forward upon this crag, because is lying\r    All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.\r\rAnd if it still doth please you to go onward,\r    Pursue your way along upon this rock;\r    Near is another crag that yields a path.\r\rYesterday, five hours later than this hour,\r    One thousand and two hundred sixty-six\r    Years were complete, that here the way was broken.\r\rI send in that direction some of mine\r    To see if any one doth air himself;\r    Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.\r\rStep forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,\xc3\x93\r    Began he to cry out, \xc3\x92and thou, Cagnazzo;\r    And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.\r\rCome forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,\r    And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,\r    And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;\r\rSearch ye all round about the boiling pitch;\r    Let these be safe as far as the next crag,\r    That all unbroken passes o\xc3\x95er the dens.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O me! what is it, Master, that I see?\r    Pray let us go,\xc3\x93 I said, \xc3\x92without an escort,\r    If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.\r\rIf thou art as observant as thy wont is,\r    Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,\r    And with their brows are threatening woe to us?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92I will not have thee fear;\r    Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,\r    Because they do it for those boiling wretches.\xc3\x93\r\rAlong the left-hand dike they wheeled about;\r    But first had each one thrust his tongue between\r    His teeth towards their leader for a signal;\r\rAnd he had made a trumpet of his rump.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXII\r\r\rI have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,\r    Begin the storming, and their muster make,\r    And sometimes starting off for their escape;\r\rVaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,\r    O Aretines, and foragers go forth,\r    Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,\r\rSometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,\r    With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,\r    And with our own, and with outlandish things,\r\rBut never yet with bagpipe so uncouth\r    Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,\r    Nor ship by any sign of land or star.\r\rWe went upon our way with the ten demons;\r    Ah, savage company! but in the church\r    With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!\r\rEver upon the pitch was my intent,\r    To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,\r    And of the people who therein were burned.\r\rEven as the dolphins, when they make a sign\r    To mariners by arching of the back,\r    That they should counsel take to save their vessel,\r\rThus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,\r    One of the sinners would display his back,\r    And in less time conceal it than it lightens.\r\rAs on the brink of water in a ditch\r    The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,\r    So that they hide their feet and other bulk,\r\rSo upon every side the sinners stood;\r    But ever as Barbariccia near them came,\r    Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.\r\rI saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,\r    One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass\r    One frog remains, and down another dives;\r\rAnd Graffiacan, who most confronted him,\r    Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,\r    And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.\r\rI knew, before, the names of all of them,\r    So had I noted them when they were chosen,\r    And when they called each other, listened how.\r\r\xc3\x92O Rubicante, see that thou do lay\r    Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,\xc3\x93\r    Cried all together the accursed ones.\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92My Master, see to it, if thou canst,\r    That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,\r    Thus come into his adversaries\xc3\x95 hands.\xc3\x93\r\rNear to the side of him my Leader drew,\r    Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:\r    \xc3\x92I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;\r\rMy mother placed me servant to a lord,\r    For she had borne me to a ribald knave,\r    Destroyer of himself and of his things.\r\rThen I domestic was of good King Thibault;\r    I set me there to practise barratry,\r    For which I pay the reckoning in this heat.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,\r    On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,\r    Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.\r\rAmong malicious cats the mouse had come;\r    But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,\r    And said: \xc3\x92Stand ye aside, while I enfork him.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd to my Master he turned round his head;\r    \xc3\x92Ask him again,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92if more thou wish\r    To know from him, before some one destroy him.\xc3\x93\r\rThe Guide: \xc3\x92Now tell then of the other culprits;\r    Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,\r    Under the pitch?\xc3\x93  And he: \xc3\x92I separated\r\rLately from one who was a neighbour to it;\r    Would that I still were covered up with him,\r    For I should fear not either claw nor hook!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd Libicocco: \xc3\x92We have borne too much;\xc3\x93\r    And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,\r    So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.\r\rEke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him\r    Down at the legs; whence their Decurion\r    Turned round and round about with evil look.\r\rWhen they again somewhat were pacified,\r    Of him, who still was looking at his wound,\r    Demanded my Conductor without stay:\r\r\xc3\x92Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting\r    Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?\xc3\x93\r    And he replied: \xc3\x92It was the Friar Gomita,\r\rHe of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,\r    Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,\r    And dealt so with them each exults thereat;\r\rMoney he took, and let them smoothly off,\r    As he says; and in other offices\r    A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.\r\rForegathers with him one Don Michael Zanche\r    Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia\r    To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.\r\rO me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;\r    Still farther would I speak, but am afraid\r    Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,\r    Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,\r    Said: \xc3\x92Stand aside there, thou malicious bird.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92If you desire either to see or hear,\xc3\x93\r    The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,\r    \xc3\x92Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.\r\rBut let the Malebranche cease a little,\r    So that these may not their revenges fear,\r    And I, down sitting in this very place,\r\rFor one that I am will make seven come,\r    When I shall whistle, as our custom is\r    To do whenever one of us comes out.\xc3\x93\r\rCagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,\r    Shaking his head, and said: \xc3\x92Just hear the trick\r    Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!\xc3\x93\r\rWhence he, who snares in great abundance had,\r    Responded: \xc3\x92I by far too cunning am,\r    When I procure for mine a greater sadness.\xc3\x93\r\rAlichin held not in, but running counter\r    Unto the rest, said to him: \xc3\x92If thou dive,\r    I will not follow thee upon the gallop,\r\rBut I will beat my wings above the pitch;\r    The height be left, and be the bank a shield\r    To see if thou alone dost countervail us.\xc3\x93\r\rO thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!\r    Each to the other side his eyes averted;\r    He first, who most reluctant was to do it.\r\rThe Navarrese selected well his time;\r    Planted his feet on land, and in a moment\r    Leaped, and released himself from their design.\r\rWhereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,\r    But he most who was cause of the defeat;\r    Therefore he moved, and cried: \xc3\x92Thou art o\xc3\x95ertakern.\xc3\x93\r\rBut little it availed, for wings could not\r    Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,\r    And, flying, upward he his breast directed;\r\rNot otherwise the duck upon a sudden\r    Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,\r    And upward he returneth cross and weary.\r\rInfuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina\r    Flying behind him followed close, desirous\r    The other should escape, to have a quarrel.\r\rAnd when the barrator had disappeared,\r    He turned his talons upon his companion,\r    And grappled with him right above the moat.\r\rBut sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk\r    To clapperclaw him well; and both of them\r    Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.\r\rA sudden intercessor was the heat;\r    But ne\xc3\x95ertheless of rising there was naught,\r    To such degree they had their wings belimed.\r\rLamenting with the others, Barbariccia\r    Made four of them fly to the other side\r    With all their gaffs, and very speedily\r\rThis side and that they to their posts descended;\r    They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,\r    Who were already baked within the crust,\r\rAnd in this manner busied did we leave them.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXIII\r\r\rSilent, alone, and without company\r    We went, the one in front, the other after,\r    As go the Minor Friars along their way.\r\rUpon the fable of Aesop was directed\r    My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,\r    Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;\r\rFor \xc3\x94mo\xc3\x95 and \xc3\x94issa\xc3\x95 are not more alike\r    Than this one is to that, if well we couple\r    End and beginning with a steadfast mind.\r\rAnd even as one thought from another springs,\r    So afterward from that was born another,\r    Which the first fear within me double made.\r\rThus did I ponder: \xc3\x92These on our account\r    Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff\r    So great, that much I think it must annoy them.\r\rIf anger be engrafted on ill-will,\r    They will come after us more merciless\r    Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,\xc3\x93\r\rI felt my hair stand all on end already\r    With terror, and stood backwardly intent,\r    When said I: \xc3\x92Master, if thou hidest not\r\rThyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche\r    I am in dread; we have them now behind us;\r    I so imagine them, I already feel them.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he: \xc3\x92If I were made of leaded glass,\r    Thine outward image I should not attract\r    Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.\r\rJust now thy thoughts came in among my own,\r    With similar attitude and similar face,\r    So that of both one counsel sole I made.\r\rIf peradventure the right bank so slope\r    That we to the next Bolgia can descend,\r    We shall escape from the imagined chase.\xc3\x93\r\rNot yet he finished rendering such opinion,\r    When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,\r    Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.\r\rMy Leader on a sudden seized me up,\r    Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,\r    And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,\r\rWho takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,\r    Having more care of him than of herself,\r    So that she clothes her only with a shift;\r\rAnd downward from the top of the hard bank\r    Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,\r    That one side of the other Bolgia walls.\r\rNe\xc3\x95er ran so swiftly water through a sluice\r    To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,\r    When nearest to the paddles it approaches,\r\rAs did my Master down along that border,\r    Bearing me with him on his breast away,\r    As his own son, and not as a companion.\r\rHardly the bed of the ravine below\r    His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill\r    Right over us; but he was not afraid;\r\rFor the high Providence, which had ordained\r    To place them ministers of the fifth moat,\r    The power of thence departing took from all.\r\rA painted people there below we found,\r    Who went about with footsteps very slow,\r    Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.\r\rThey had on mantles with the hoods low down\r    Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut\r    That in Cologne they for the monks are made.\r\rWithout, they gilded are so that it dazzles;\r    But inwardly all leaden and so heavy\r    That Frederick used to put them on of straw.\r\rO everlastingly fatiguing mantle!\r    Again we turned us, still to the left hand\r    Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;\r\rBut owing to the weight, that weary folk\r    Came on so tardily, that we were new\r    In company at each motion of the haunch.\r\rWhence I unto my Leader: \xc3\x92See thou find\r    Some one who may by deed or name be known,\r    And thus in going move thine eye about.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd one, who understood the Tuscan speech,\r    Cried to us from behind: \xc3\x92Stay ye your feet,\r    Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!\r\rPerhaps thou\xc3\x95lt have from me what thou demandest.\xc3\x93\r    Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: \xc3\x92Wait,\r    And then according to his pace proceed.\xc3\x93\r\rI stopped, and two beheld I show great haste\r    Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;\r    But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.\r\rWhen they came up, long with an eye askance\r    They scanned me without uttering a word.\r    Then to each other turned, and said together:\r\r\xc3\x92He by the action of his throat seems living;\r    And if they dead are, by what privilege\r    Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?\xc3\x93\r\rThen said to me: \xc3\x92Tuscan, who to the college\r    Of miserable hypocrites art come,\r    Do not disdain to tell us who thou art.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to them: \xc3\x92Born was I, and grew up\r    In the great town on the fair river of Arno,\r    And with the body am I\xc3\x95ve always had.\r\rBut who are ye, in whom there trickles down\r    Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?\r    And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd one replied to me: \xc3\x92These orange cloaks\r    Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights\r    Cause in this way their balances to creak.\r\rFrati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;\r    I Catalano, and he Loderingo\r    Named, and together taken by thy city,\r\rAs the wont is to take one man alone,\r    For maintenance of its peace; and we were such\r    That still it is apparent round Gardingo.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O Friars,\xc3\x93 began I, \xc3\x92your iniquitous. . .\xc3\x93\r    But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed\r    One crucified with three stakes on the ground.\r\rWhen me he saw, he writhed himself all over,\r    Blowing into his beard with suspirations;\r    And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,\r\rSaid to me: \xc3\x92This transfixed one, whom thou seest,\r    Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet\r    To put one man to torture for the people.\r\rCrosswise and naked is he on the path,\r    As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,\r    Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;\r\rAnd in like mode his father-in-law is punished\r    Within this moat, and the others of the council,\r    Which for the Jews was a malignant seed.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel\r    O\xc3\x95er him who was extended on the cross\r    So vilely in eternal banishment.\r\rThen he directed to the Friar this voice:\r    \xc3\x92Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us\r    If to the right hand any pass slope down\r\rBy which we two may issue forth from here,\r    Without constraining some of the black angels\r    To come and extricate us from this deep.\xc3\x93\r\rThen he made answer: \xc3\x92Nearer than thou hopest\r    There is a rock, that forth from the great circle\r    Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,\r\rSave that at this \xc3\x95tis broken, and does not bridge it;\r    You will be able to mount up the ruin,\r    That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.\xc3\x93\r\rThe Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;\r    Then said: \xc3\x92The business badly he recounted\r    Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd the Friar: \xc3\x92Many of the Devil\xc3\x95s vices\r    Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,\r    That he\xc3\x95s a liar and the father of lies.\xc3\x93\r\rThereat my Leader with great strides went on,\r    Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;\r    Whence from the heavy-laden I departed\r\rAfter the prints of his beloved feet.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXIV\r\r\rIn that part of the youthful year wherein\r    The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,\r    And now the nights draw near to half the day,\r\rWhat time the hoar-frost copies on the ground\r    The outward semblance of her sister white,\r    But little lasts the temper of her pen,\r\rThe husbandman, whose forage faileth him,\r    Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign\r    All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,\r\rReturns in doors, and up and down laments,\r    Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;\r    Then he returns and hope revives again,\r\rSeeing the world has changed its countenance\r    In little time, and takes his shepherd\xc3\x95s crook,\r    And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.\r\rThus did the Master fill me with alarm,\r    When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,\r    And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.\r\rFor as we came unto the ruined bridge,\r    The Leader turned to me with that sweet look\r    Which at the mountain\xc3\x95s foot I first beheld.\r\rHis arms he opened, after some advisement\r    Within himself elected, looking first\r    Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.\r\rAnd even as he who acts and meditates,\r    For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,\r    So upward lifting me towards the summit\r\rOf a huge rock, he scanned another crag,\r    Saying: \xc3\x92To that one grapple afterwards,\r    But try first if \xc3\x95tis such that it will hold thee.\xc3\x93\r\rThis was no way for one clothed with a cloak;\r    For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,\r    Were able to ascend from jag to jag.\r\rAnd had it not been, that upon that precinct\r    Shorter was the ascent than on the other,\r    He I know not, but I had been dead beat.\r\rBut because Malebolge tow\xc3\x95rds the mouth\r    Of the profoundest well is all inclining,\r    The structure of each valley doth import\r\rThat one bank rises and the other sinks.\r    Still we arrived at length upon the point\r    Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.\r\rThe breath was from my lungs so milked away,\r    When I was up, that I could go no farther,\r    Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.\r\r\xc3\x92Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,\xc3\x93\r    My Master said; \xc3\x92for sitting upon down,\r    Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,\r\rWithouten which whoso his life consumes\r    Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,\r    As smoke in air or in the water foam.\r\rAnd therefore raise thee up, o\xc3\x95ercome the anguish\r    With spirit that o\xc3\x95ercometh every battle,\r    If with its heavy body it sink not.\r\rA longer stairway it behoves thee mount;\r    \xc3\x95Tis not enough from these to have departed;\r    Let it avail thee, if thou understand me.\xc3\x93\r\rThen I uprose, showing myself provided\r    Better with breath than I did feel myself,\r    And said: \xc3\x92Go on, for I am strong and bold.\xc3\x93\r\rUpward we took our way along the crag,\r    Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,\r    And more precipitous far than that before.\r\rSpeaking I went, not to appear exhausted;\r    Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,\r    Not well adapted to articulate words.\r\rI know not what it said, though o\xc3\x95er the back\r    I now was of the arch that passes there;\r    But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.\r\rI was bent downward, but my living eyes\r    Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;\r    Wherefore I: \xc3\x92Master, see that thou arrive\r\rAt the next round, and let us descend the wall;\r    For as from hence I hear and understand not,\r    So I look down and nothing I distinguish.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Other response,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92I make thee not,\r    Except the doing; for the modest asking\r    Ought to be followed by the deed in silence.\xc3\x93\r\rWe from the bridge descended at its head,\r    Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,\r    And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;\r\rAnd I beheld therein a terrible throng\r    Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,\r    That the remembrance still congeals my blood\r\rLet Libya boast no longer with her sand;\r    For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae\r    She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,\r\rNeither so many plagues nor so malignant\r    E\xc3\x95er showed she with all Ethiopia,\r    Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!\r\rAmong this cruel and most dismal throng\r    People were running naked and affrighted.\r    Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.\r\rThey had their hands with serpents bound behind them;\r    These riveted upon their reins the tail\r    And head, and were in front of them entwined.\r\rAnd lo! at one who was upon our side\r    There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him\r    There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.\r\rNor \xc3\x94O\xc3\x95 so quickly e\xc3\x95er, nor \xc3\x94I\xc3\x95 was written,\r    As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly\r    Behoved it that in falling he became.\r\rAnd when he on the ground was thus destroyed,\r    The ashes drew together, and of themselves\r    Into himself they instantly returned.\r\rEven thus by the great sages \xc3\x95tis confessed\r    The phoenix dies, and then is born again,\r    When it approaches its five-hundredth year;\r\rOn herb or grain it feeds not in its life,\r    But only on tears of incense and amomum,\r    And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.\r\rAnd as he is who falls, and knows not how,\r    By force of demons who to earth down drag him,\r    Or other oppilation that binds man,\r\rWhen he arises and around him looks,\r    Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish\r    Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;\r\rSuch was that sinner after he had risen.\r    Justice of God! O how severe it is,\r    That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!\r\rThe Guide thereafter asked him who he was;\r    Whence he replied: \xc3\x92I rained from Tuscany\r    A short time since into this cruel gorge.\r\rA bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,\r    Even as the mule I was; I\xc3\x95m Vanni Fucci,\r    Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I unto the Guide: \xc3\x92Tell him to stir not,\r    And ask what crime has thrust him here below,\r    For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,\r    But unto me directed mind and face,\r    And with a melancholy shame was painted.\r\rThen said: \xc3\x92It pains me more that thou hast caught me\r    Amid this misery where thou seest me,\r    Than when I from the other life was taken.\r\rWhat thou demandest I cannot deny;\r    So low am I put down because I robbed\r    The sacristy of the fair ornaments,\r\rAnd falsely once \xc3\x95twas laid upon another;\r    But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,\r    If thou shalt e\xc3\x95er be out of the dark places,\r\rThine ears to my announcement ope and hear:\r    Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;\r    Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;\r\rMars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,\r    Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,\r    And with impetuous and bitter tempest\r\rOver Campo Picen shall be the battle;\r    When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,\r    So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.\r\rAnd this I\xc3\x95ve said that it may give thee pain.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXV\r\r\rAt the conclusion of his words, the thief\r    Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,\r    Crying: \xc3\x92Take that, God, for at thee I aim them.\xc3\x93\r\rFrom that time forth the serpents were my friends;\r    For one entwined itself about his neck\r    As if it said: \xc3\x92I will not thou speak more;\xc3\x93\r\rAnd round his arms another, and rebound him,\r    Clinching itself together so in front,\r    That with them he could not a motion make.\r\rPistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not\r    To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,\r    Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?\r\rThrough all the sombre circles of this Hell,\r    Spirit I saw not against God so proud,\r    Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!\r\rHe fled away, and spake no further word;\r    And I beheld a Centaur full of rage\r    Come crying out: \xc3\x92Where is, where is the scoffer?\xc3\x93\r\rI do not think Maremma has so many\r    Serpents as he had all along his back,\r    As far as where our countenance begins.\r\rUpon the shoulders, just behind the nape,\r    With wings wide open was a dragon lying,\r    And he sets fire to all that he encounters.\r\rMy Master said: \xc3\x92That one is Cacus, who\r    Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine\r    Created oftentimes a lake of blood.\r\rHe goes not on the same road with his brothers,\r    By reason of the fraudulent theft he made\r    Of the great herd, which he had near to him;\r\rWhereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath\r    The mace of Hercules, who peradventure\r    Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten.\xc3\x93\r\rWhile he was speaking thus, he had passed by,\r    And spirits three had underneath us come,\r    Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,\r\rUntil what time they shouted: \xc3\x92Who are you?\xc3\x93\r    On which account our story made a halt,\r    And then we were intent on them alone.\r\rI did not know them; but it came to pass,\r    As it is wont to happen by some chance,\r    That one to name the other was compelled,\r\rExclaiming: \xc3\x92Where can Cianfa have remained?\xc3\x93\r    Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,\r    Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.\r\rIf thou art, Reader, slow now to believe\r    What I shall say, it will no marvel be,\r    For I who saw it hardly can admit it.\r\rAs I was holding raised on them my brows,\r    Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth\r    In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.\r\rWith middle feet it bound him round the paunch,\r    And with the forward ones his arms it seized;\r    Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;\r\rThe hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,\r    And put its tail through in between the two,\r    And up behind along the reins outspread it.\r\rIvy was never fastened by its barbs\r    Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile\r    Upon the other\xc3\x95s limbs entwined its own.\r\rThen they stuck close, as if of heated wax\r    They had been made, and intermixed their colour;\r    Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;\r\rE\xc3\x95en as proceedeth on before the flame\r    Upward along the paper a brown colour,\r    Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.\r\rThe other two looked on, and each of them\r    Cried out: \xc3\x92O me, Agnello, how thou changest!\r    Behold, thou now art neither two nor one.\xc3\x93\r\rAlready the two heads had one become,\r    When there appeared to us two figures mingled\r    Into one face, wherein the two were lost.\r\rOf the four lists were fashioned the two arms,\r    The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest\r    Members became that never yet were seen.\r\rEvery original aspect there was cancelled;\r    Two and yet none did the perverted image\r    Appear, and such departed with slow pace.\r\rEven as a lizard, under the great scourge\r    Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,\r    Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;\r\rThus did appear, coming towards the bellies\r    Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,\r    Livid and black as is a peppercorn.\r\rAnd in that part whereat is first received\r    Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;\r    Then downward fell in front of him extended.\r\rThe one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;\r    Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,\r    Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.\r\rHe at the serpent gazed, and it at him;\r    One through the wound, the other through the mouth\r    Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.\r\rHenceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions\r    Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,\r    And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.\r\rBe silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;\r    For if him to a snake, her to fountain,\r    Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;\r\rBecause two natures never front to front\r    Has he transmuted, so that both the forms\r    To interchange their matter ready were.\r\rTogether they responded in such wise,\r    That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,\r    And eke the wounded drew his feet together.\r\rThe legs together with the thighs themselves\r    Adhered so, that in little time the juncture\r    No sign whatever made that was apparent.\r\rHe with the cloven tail assumed the figure\r    The other one was losing, and his skin\r    Became elastic, and the other\xc3\x95s hard.\r\rI saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,\r    And both feet of the reptile, that were short,\r    Lengthen as much as those contracted were.\r\rThereafter the hind feet, together twisted,\r    Became the member that a man conceals,\r    And of his own the wretch had two created.\r\rWhile both of them the exhalation veils\r    With a new colour, and engenders hair\r    On one of them and depilates the other,\r\rThe one uprose and down the other fell,\r    Though turning not away their impious lamps,\r    Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.\r\rHe who was standing drew it tow\xc3\x95rds the temples,\r    And from excess of matter, which came thither,\r    Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;\r\rWhat did not backward run and was retained\r    Of that excess made to the face a nose,\r    And the lips thickened far as was befitting.\r\rHe who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,\r    And backward draws the ears into his head,\r    In the same manner as the snail its horns;\r\rAnd so the tongue, which was entire and apt\r    For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked\r    In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.\r\rThe soul, which to a reptile had been changed,\r    Along the valley hissing takes to flight,\r    And after him the other speaking sputters.\r\rThen did he turn upon him his new shoulders,\r    And said to the other: \xc3\x92I\xc3\x95ll have Buoso run,\r    Crawling as I have done, along this road.\xc3\x93\r\rIn this way I beheld the seventh ballast\r    Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse\r    The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.\r\rAnd notwithstanding that mine eyes might be\r    Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,\r    They could not flee away so secretly\r\rBut that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;\r    And he it was who sole of three companions,\r    Which came in the beginning, was not changed;\r\rThe other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXVI\r\r\rRejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,\r    That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,\r    And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!\r\rAmong the thieves five citizens of thine\r    Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,\r    And thou thereby to no great honour risest.\r\rBut if when morn is near our dreams are true,\r    Feel shalt thou in a little time from now\r    What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.\r\rAnd if it now were, it were not too soon;\r    Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,\r    For \xc3\x95twill aggrieve me more the more I age.\r\rWe went our way, and up along the stairs\r    The bourns had made us to descend before,\r    Remounted my Conductor and drew me.\r\rAnd following the solitary path\r    Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,\r    The foot without the hand sped not at all.\r\rThen sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,\r    When I direct my mind to what I saw,\r    And more my genius curb than I am wont,\r\rThat it may run not unless virtue guide it;\r    So that if some good star, or better thing,\r    Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.\r\rAs many as the hind (who on the hill\r    Rests at the time when he who lights the world\r    His countenance keeps least concealed from us,\r\rWhile as the fly gives place unto the gnat)\r    Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,\r    Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;\r\rWith flames as manifold resplendent all\r    Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware\r    As soon as I was where the depth appeared.\r\rAnd such as he who with the bears avenged him\r    Beheld Elijah\xc3\x95s chariot at departing,\r    What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,\r\rFor with his eye he could not follow it\r    So as to see aught else than flame alone,\r    Even as a little cloud ascending upward,\r\rThus each along the gorge of the intrenchment\r    Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,\r    And every flame a sinner steals away.\r\rI stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,\r    So that, if I had seized not on a rock,\r    Down had I fallen without being pushed.\r\rAnd the Leader, who beheld me so attent,\r    Exclaimed: \xc3\x92Within the fires the spirits are;\r    Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92My Master,\xc3\x93 I replied, \xc3\x92by hearing thee\r    I am more sure; but I surmised already\r    It might be so, and already wished to ask thee\r\rWho is within that fire, which comes so cleft\r    At top, it seems uprising from the pyre\r    Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.\xc3\x93\r\rHe answered me: \xc3\x92Within there are tormented\r    Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together\r    They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.\r\rAnd there within their flame do they lament\r    The ambush of the horse, which made the door\r    Whence issued forth the Romans\xc3\x95 gentle seed;\r\rTherein is wept the craft, for which being dead\r    Deidamia still deplores Achilles,\r    And pain for the Palladium there is borne.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92If they within those sparks possess the power\r    To speak,\xc3\x93 I said, \xc3\x92thee, Master, much I pray,\r    And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,\r\rThat thou make no denial of awaiting\r    Until the horned flame shall hither come;\r    Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Worthy is thy entreaty\r    Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;\r    But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.\r\rLeave me to speak, because I have conceived\r    That which thou wishest; for they might disdain\r    Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine.\xc3\x93\r\rWhen now the flame had come unto that point,\r    Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,\r    After this fashion did I hear him speak:\r\r\xc3\x92O ye, who are twofold within one fire,\r    If I deserved of you, while I was living,\r    If I deserved of you or much or little\r\rWhen in the world I wrote the lofty verses,\r    Do not move on, but one of you declare\r    Whither, being lost, he went away to die.\xc3\x93\r\rThen of the antique flame the greater horn,\r    Murmuring, began to wave itself about\r    Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.\r\rThereafterward, the summit to and fro\r    Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,\r    It uttered forth a voice, and said: \xc3\x92When I\r\rFrom Circe had departed, who concealed me\r    More than a year there near unto Gaeta,\r    Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,\r\rNor fondness for my son, nor reverence\r    For my old father, nor the due affection\r    Which joyous should have made Penelope,\r\rCould overcome within me the desire\r    I had to be experienced of the world,\r    And of the vice and virtue of mankind;\r\rBut I put forth on the high open sea\r    With one sole ship, and that small company\r    By which I never had deserted been.\r\rBoth of the shores I saw as far as Spain,\r    Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,\r    And the others which that sea bathes round about.\r\rI and my company were old and slow\r    When at that narrow passage we arrived\r    Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,\r\rThat man no farther onward should adventure.\r    On the right hand behind me left I Seville,\r    And on the other already had left Ceuta.\r\r\xc3\x94O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand\r    Perils,\xc3\x95 I said, \xc3\x94have come unto the West,\r    To this so inconsiderable vigil\r\rWhich is remaining of your senses still\r    Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,\r    Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.\r\rConsider ye the seed from which ye sprang;\r    Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,\r    But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.\xc3\x95\r\rSo eager did I render my companions,\r    With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,\r    That then I hardly could have held them back.\r\rAnd having turned our stern unto the morning,\r    We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,\r    Evermore gaining on the larboard side.\r\rAlready all the stars of the other pole\r    The night beheld, and ours so very low\r    It did not rise above the ocean floor.\r\rFive times rekindled and as many quenched\r    Had been the splendour underneath the moon,\r    Since we had entered into the deep pass,\r\rWhen there appeared to us a mountain, dim\r    From distance, and it seemed to me so high\r    As I had never any one beheld.\r\rJoyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;\r    For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,\r    And smote upon the fore part of the ship.\r\rThree times it made her whirl with all the waters,\r    At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,\r    And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,\r\rUntil the sea above us closed again.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXVII\r\r\rAlready was the flame erect and quiet,\r    To speak no more, and now departed from us\r    With the permission of the gentle Poet;\r\rWhen yet another, which behind it came,\r    Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top\r    By a confused sound that issued from it.\r\rAs the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first\r    With the lament of him, and that was right,\r    Who with his file had modulated it)\r\rBellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,\r    That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,\r    Still it appeared with agony transfixed;\r\rThus, by not having any way or issue\r    At first from out the fire, to its own language\r    Converted were the melancholy words.\r\rBut afterwards, when they had gathered way\r    Up through the point, giving it that vibration\r    The tongue had given them in their passage out,\r\rWe heard it said: \xc3\x92O thou, at whom I aim\r    My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,\r    Saying, \xc3\x94Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,\xc3\x95\r\rBecause I come perchance a little late,\r    To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;\r    Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.\r\rIf thou but lately into this blind world\r    Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,\r    Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,\r\rSay, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,\r    For I was from the mountains there between\r    Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts.\xc3\x93\r\rI still was downward bent and listening,\r    When my Conductor touched me on the side,\r    Saying: \xc3\x92Speak thou: this one a Latian is.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I, who had beforehand my reply\r    In readiness, forthwith began to speak:\r    \xc3\x92O soul, that down below there art concealed,\r\rRomagna thine is not and never has been\r    Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;\r    But open war I none have left there now.\r\rRavenna stands as it long years has stood;\r    The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,\r    So that she covers Cervia with her vans.\r\rThe city which once made the long resistance,\r    And of the French a sanguinary heap,\r    Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;\r\rVerrucchio\xc3\x95s ancient Mastiff and the new,\r    Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,\r    Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.\r\rThe cities of Lamone and Santerno\r    Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,\r    Who changes sides \xc3\x95twixt summer-time and winter;\r\rAnd that of which the Savio bathes the flank,\r    Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,\r    Lives between tyranny and a free state.\r\rNow I entreat thee tell us who thou art;\r    Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,\r    So may thy name hold front there in the world.\xc3\x93\r\rAfter the fire a little more had roared\r    In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved\r    This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:\r\r\xc3\x92If I believed that my reply were made\r    To one who to the world would e\xc3\x95er return,\r    This flame without more flickering would stand still;\r\rBut inasmuch as never from this depth\r    Did any one return, if I hear true,\r    Without the fear of infamy I answer,\r\rI was a man of arms, then Cordelier,\r    Believing thus begirt to make amends;\r    And truly my belief had been fulfilled\r\rBut for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,\r    Who put me back into my former sins;\r    And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.\r\rWhile I was still the form of bone and pulp\r    My mother gave to me, the deeds I did\r    Were not those of a lion, but a fox.\r\rThe machinations and the covert ways\r    I knew them all, and practised so their craft,\r    That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.\r\rWhen now unto that portion of mine age\r    I saw myself arrived, when each one ought\r    To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,\r\rThat which before had pleased me then displeased me;\r    And penitent and confessing I surrendered,\r    Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;\r\rThe Leader of the modern Pharisees\r    Having a war near unto Lateran,\r    And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,\r\rFor each one of his enemies was Christian,\r    And none of them had been to conquer Acre,\r    Nor merchandising in the Sultan\xc3\x95s land,\r\rNor the high office, nor the sacred orders,\r    In him regarded, nor in me that cord\r    Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;\r\rBut even as Constantine sought out Sylvester\r    To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,\r    So this one sought me out as an adept\r\rTo cure him of the fever of his pride.\r    Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,\r    Because his words appeared inebriate.\r\rAnd then he said: \xc3\x94Be not thy heart afraid;\r    Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me\r    How to raze Palestrina to the ground.\r\rHeaven have I power to lock and to unlock,\r    As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,\r    The which my predecessor held not dear.\xc3\x95\r\rThen urged me on his weighty arguments\r    There, where my silence was the worst advice;\r    And said I: \xc3\x94Father, since thou washest me\r\rOf that sin into which I now must fall,\r    The promise long with the fulfilment short\r    Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.\xc3\x95\r\rFrancis came afterward, when I was dead,\r    For me; but one of the black Cherubim\r    Said to him: \xc3\x94Take him not; do me no wrong;\r\rHe must come down among my servitors,\r    Because he gave the fraudulent advice\r    From which time forth I have been at his hair;\r\rFor who repents not cannot be absolved,\r    Nor can one both repent and will at once,\r    Because of the contradiction which consents not.\xc3\x95\r\rO miserable me! how I did shudder\r    When he seized on me, saying: \xc3\x94Peradventure\r    Thou didst not think that I was a logician!\xc3\x95\r\rHe bore me unto Minos, who entwined\r    Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,\r    And after he had bitten it in great rage,\r\rSaid: \xc3\x94Of the thievish fire a culprit this;\xc3\x95\r    Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,\r    And vested thus in going I bemoan me.\xc3\x93\r\rWhen it had thus completed its recital,\r    The flame departed uttering lamentations,\r    Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.\r\rOnward we passed, both I and my Conductor,\r    Up o\xc3\x95er the crag above another arch,\r    Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee\r\rBy those who, sowing discord, win their burden.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXVIII\r\r\rWho ever could, e\xc3\x95en with untrammelled words,\r    Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full\r    Which now I saw, by many times narrating?\r\rEach tongue would for a certainty fall short\r    By reason of our speech and memory,\r    That have small room to comprehend so much.\r\rIf were again assembled all the people\r    Which formerly upon the fateful land\r    Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood\r\rShed by the Romans and the lingering war\r    That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,\r    As Livy has recorded, who errs not,\r\rWith those who felt the agony of blows\r    By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,\r    And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still\r\rAt Ceperano, where a renegade\r    Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,\r    Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,\r\rAnd one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,\r    Should show, it would be nothing to compare\r    With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.\r\rA cask by losing centre-piece or cant\r    Was never shattered so, as I saw one\r    Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.\r\rBetween his legs were hanging down his entrails;\r    His heart was visible, and the dismal sack\r    That maketh excrement of what is eaten.\r\rWhile I was all absorbed in seeing him,\r    He looked at me, and opened with his hands\r    His bosom, saying: \xc3\x92See now how I rend me;\r\rHow mutilated, see, is Mahomet;\r    In front of me doth Ali weeping go,\r    Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;\r\rAnd all the others whom thou here beholdest,\r    Disseminators of scandal and of schism\r    While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.\r\rA devil is behind here, who doth cleave us\r    Thus cruelly, unto the falchion\xc3\x95s edge\r    Putting again each one of all this ream,\r\rWhen we have gone around the doleful road;\r    By reason that our wounds are closed again\r    Ere any one in front of him repass.\r\rBut who art thou, that musest on the crag,\r    Perchance to postpone going to the pain\r    That is adjudged upon thine accusations?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,\xc3\x93\r    My Master made reply, \xc3\x92to be tormented;\r    But to procure him full experience,\r\rMe, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him\r    Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;\r    And this is true as that I speak to thee.\xc3\x93\r\rMore than a hundred were there when they heard him,\r    Who in the moat stood still to look at me,\r    Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.\r\r\xc3\x92Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,\r    Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,\r    If soon he wish not here to follow me,\r\rSo with provisions, that no stress of snow\r    May give the victory to the Novarese,\r    Which otherwise to gain would not be easy.\xc3\x93\r\rAfter one foot to go away he lifted,\r    This word did Mahomet say unto me,\r    Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.\r\rAnother one, who had his throat pierced through,\r    And nose cut off close underneath the brows,\r    And had no longer but a single ear,\r\rStaying to look in wonder with the others,\r    Before the others did his gullet open,\r    Which outwardly was red in every part,\r\rAnd said: \xc3\x92O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,\r    And whom I once saw up in Latian land,\r    Unless too great similitude deceive me,\r\rCall to remembrance Pier da Medicina,\r    If e\xc3\x95er thou see again the lovely plain\r    That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,\r\rAnd make it known to the best two of Fano,\r    To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,\r    That if foreseeing here be not in vain,\r\rCast over from their vessel shall they be,\r    And drowned near unto the Cattolica,\r    By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.\r\rBetween the isles of Cyprus and Majorca\r    Neptune ne\xc3\x95er yet beheld so great a crime,\r    Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.\r\rThat traitor, who sees only with one eye,\r    And holds the land, which some one here with me\r    Would fain be fasting from the vision of,\r\rWill make them come unto a parley with him;\r    Then will do so, that to Focara\xc3\x95s wind\r    They will not stand in need of vow or prayer.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92Show to me and declare,\r    If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,\r    Who is this person of the bitter vision.\xc3\x93\r\rThen did he lay his hand upon the jaw\r    Of one of his companions, and his mouth\r    Oped, crying: \xc3\x92This is he, and he speaks not.\r\rThis one, being banished, every doubt submerged\r    In Caesar by affirming the forearmed\r    Always with detriment allowed delay.\xc3\x93\r\rO how bewildered unto me appeared,\r    With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,\r    Curio, who in speaking was so bold!\r\rAnd one, who both his hands dissevered had,\r    The stumps uplifting through the murky air,\r    So that the blood made horrible his face,\r\rCried out: \xc3\x92Thou shalt remember Mosca also,\r    Who said, alas! \xc3\x94A thing done has an end!\xc3\x95\r    Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92And death unto thy race,\xc3\x93 thereto I added;\r    Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,\r    Departed, like a person sad and crazed.\r\rBut I remained to look upon the crowd;\r    And saw a thing which I should be afraid,\r    Without some further proof, even to recount,\r\rIf it were not that conscience reassures me,\r    That good companion which emboldens man\r    Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.\r\rI truly saw, and still I seem to see it,\r    A trunk without a head walk in like manner\r    As walked the others of the mournful herd.\r\rAnd by the hair it held the head dissevered,\r    Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,\r    And that upon us gazed and said: \xc3\x92O me!\xc3\x93\r\rIt of itself made to itself a lamp,\r    And they were two in one, and one in two;\r    How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.\r\rWhen it was come close to the bridge\xc3\x95s foot,\r    It lifted high its arm with all the head,\r    To bring more closely unto us its words,\r\rWhich were: \xc3\x92Behold now the sore penalty,\r    Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;\r    Behold if any be as great as this.\r\rAnd so that thou may carry news of me,\r    Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same\r    Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.\r\rI made the father and the son rebellious;\r    Achitophel not more with Absalom\r    And David did with his accursed goadings.\r\rBecause I parted persons so united,\r    Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!\r    From its beginning, which is in this trunk.\r\rThus is observed in me the counterpoise.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXIX\r\r\rThe many people and the divers wounds\r    These eyes of mine had so inebriated,\r    That they were wishful to stand still and weep;\r\rBut said Virgilius: \xc3\x92What dost thou still gaze at?\r    Why is thy sight still riveted down there\r    Among the mournful, mutilated shades?\r\rThou hast not done so at the other Bolge;\r    Consider, if to count them thou believest,\r    That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,\r\rAnd now the moon is underneath our feet;\r    Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,\r    And more is to be seen than what thou seest.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92If thou hadst,\xc3\x93 I made answer thereupon,\r    \xc3\x92Attended to the cause for which I looked,\r    Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned.\xc3\x93\r\rMeanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him\r    I went, already making my reply,\r    And superadding: \xc3\x92In that cavern where\r\rI held mine eyes with such attention fixed,\r    I think a spirit of my blood laments\r    The sin which down below there costs so much.\xc3\x93\r\rThen said the Master: \xc3\x92Be no longer broken\r    Thy thought from this time forward upon him;\r    Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;\r\rFor him I saw below the little bridge,\r    Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger\r    Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.\r\rSo wholly at that time wast thou impeded\r    By him who formerly held Altaforte,\r    Thou didst not look that way; so he departed.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O my Conductor, his own violent death,\r    Which is not yet avenged for him,\xc3\x93 I said,\r    \xc3\x92By any who is sharer in the shame,\r\rMade him disdainful; whence he went away,\r    As I imagine, without speaking to me,\r    And thereby made me pity him the more.\xc3\x93\r\rThus did we speak as far as the first place\r    Upon the crag, which the next valley shows\r    Down to the bottom, if there were more light.\r\rWhen we were now right over the last cloister\r    Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers\r    Could manifest themselves unto our sight,\r\rDivers lamentings pierced me through and through,\r    Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,\r    Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.\r\rWhat pain would be, if from the hospitals\r    Of Valdichiana, \xc3\x95twixt July and September,\r    And of Maremma and Sardinia\r\rAll the diseases in one moat were gathered,\r    Such was it here, and such a stench came from it\r    As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.\r\rWe had descended on the furthest bank\r    From the long crag, upon the left hand still,\r    And then more vivid was my power of sight\r\rDown tow\xc3\x95rds the bottom, where the ministress\r    Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,\r    Punishes forgers, which she here records.\r\rI do not think a sadder sight to see\r    Was in Aegina the whole people sick,\r    (When was the air so full of pestilence,\r\rThe animals, down to the little worm,\r    All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,\r    According as the poets have affirmed,\r\rWere from the seed of ants restored again,)\r    Than was it to behold through that dark valley\r    The spirits languishing in divers heaps.\r\rThis on the belly, that upon the back\r    One of the other lay, and others crawling\r    Shifted themselves along the dismal road.\r\rWe step by step went onward without speech,\r    Gazing upon and listening to the sick\r    Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.\r\rI saw two sitting leaned against each other,\r    As leans in heating platter against platter,\r    From head to foot bespotted o\xc3\x95er with scabs;\r\rAnd never saw I plied a currycomb\r    By stable-boy for whom his master waits,\r    Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,\r\rAs every one was plying fast the bite\r    Of nails upon himself, for the great rage\r    Of itching which no other succour had.\r\rAnd the nails downward with them dragged the scab,\r    In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,\r    Or any other fish that has them largest.\r\r\xc3\x92O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,\xc3\x93\r    Began my Leader unto one of them,\r    \xc3\x92And makest of them pincers now and then,\r\rTell me if any Latian is with those\r    Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee\r    To all eternity unto this work.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,\r    Both of us here,\xc3\x93 one weeping made reply;\r    \xc3\x92But who art thou, that questionest about us?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd said the Guide: \xc3\x92One am I who descends\r    Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,\r    And I intend to show Hell unto him.\xc3\x93\r\rThen broken was their mutual support,\r    And trembling each one turned himself to me,\r    With others who had heard him by rebound.\r\rWholly to me did the good Master gather,\r    Saying: \xc3\x92Say unto them whate\xc3\x95er thou wishest.\xc3\x93\r    And I began, since he would have it so:\r\r\xc3\x92So may your memory not steal away\r    In the first world from out the minds of men,\r    But so may it survive \xc3\x95neath many suns,\r\rSay to me who ye are, and of what people;\r    Let not your foul and loathsome punishment\r    Make you afraid to show yourselves to me.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92I of Arezzo was,\xc3\x93 one made reply,\r    \xc3\x92And Albert of Siena had me burned;\r    But what I died for does not bring me here.\r\r\xc3\x95Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,\r    That I could rise by flight into the air,\r    And he who had conceit, but little wit,\r\rWould have me show to him the art; and only\r    Because no Daedalus I made him, made me\r    Be burned by one who held him as his son.\r\rBut unto the last Bolgia of the ten,\r    For alchemy, which in the world I practised,\r    Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd to the Poet said I: \xc3\x92Now was ever\r    So vain a people as the Sienese?\r    Not for a certainty the French by far.\xc3\x93\r\rWhereat the other leper, who had heard me,\r    Replied unto my speech: \xc3\x92Taking out Stricca,\r    Who knew the art of moderate expenses,\r\rAnd Niccolo, who the luxurious use\r    Of cloves discovered earliest of all\r    Within that garden where such seed takes root;\r\rAnd taking out the band, among whom squandered\r    Caccia d\xc3\x95Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,\r    And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!\r\rBut, that thou know who thus doth second thee\r    Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye\r    Tow\xc3\x95rds me, so that my face well answer thee,\r\rAnd thou shalt see I am Capocchio\xc3\x95s shade,\r    Who metals falsified by alchemy;\r    Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,\r\rHow I a skilful ape of nature was.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXX\r\r\r\xc3\x95Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,\r    For Semele, against the Theban blood,\r    As she already more than once had shown,\r\rSo reft of reason Athamas became,\r    That, seeing his own wife with children twain\r    Walking encumbered upon either hand,\r\rHe cried: \xc3\x92Spread out the nets, that I may take\r    The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;\xc3\x93\r    And then extended his unpitying claws,\r\rSeizing the first, who had the name Learchus,\r    And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;\r    And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;\xc3\x91\r\rAnd at the time when fortune downward hurled\r    The Trojan\xc3\x95s arrogance, that all things dared,\r    So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,\r\rHecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,\r    When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,\r    And of her Polydorus on the shore\r\rOf ocean was the dolorous one aware,\r    Out of her senses like a dog she barked,\r    So much the anguish had her mind distorted;\r\rBut not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan\r    Were ever seen in any one so cruel\r    In goading beasts, and much more human members,\r\rAs I beheld two shadows pale and naked,\r    Who, biting, in the manner ran along\r    That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.\r\rOne to Capocchio came, and by the nape\r    Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging\r    It made his belly grate the solid bottom.\r\rAnd the Aretine, who trembling had remained,\r    Said to me: \xc3\x92That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,\r    And raving goes thus harrying other people.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O,\xc3\x93 said I to him, \xc3\x92so may not the other\r    Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee\r    To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92That is the ancient ghost\r    Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became\r    Beyond all rightful love her father\xc3\x95s lover.\r\rShe came to sin with him after this manner,\r    By counterfeiting of another\xc3\x95s form;\r    As he who goeth yonder undertook,\r\rThat he might gain the lady of the herd,\r    To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,\r    Making a will and giving it due form.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd after the two maniacs had passed\r    On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back\r    To look upon the other evil-born.\r\rI saw one made in fashion of a lute,\r    If he had only had the groin cut off\r    Just at the point at which a man is forked.\r\rThe heavy dropsy, that so disproportions\r    The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,\r    That the face corresponds not to the belly,\r\rCompelled him so to hold his lips apart\r    As does the hectic, who because of thirst\r    One tow\xc3\x95rds the chin, the other upward turns.\r\r\xc3\x92O ye, who without any torment are,\r    And why I know not, in the world of woe,\xc3\x93\r    He said to us, \xc3\x92behold, and be attentive\r\rUnto the misery of Master Adam;\r    I had while living much of what I wished,\r    And now, alas! a drop of water crave.\r\rThe rivulets, that from the verdant hills\r    Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,\r    Making their channels to be cold and moist,\r\rEver before me stand, and not in vain;\r    For far more doth their image dry me up\r    Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.\r\rThe rigid justice that chastises me\r    Draweth occasion from the place in which\r    I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.\r\rThere is Romena, where I counterfeited\r    The currency imprinted with the Baptist,\r    For which I left my body burned above.\r\rBut if I here could see the tristful soul\r    Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,\r    For Branda\xc3\x95s fount I would not give the sight.\r\rOne is within already, if the raving\r    Shades that are going round about speak truth;\r    But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?\r\rIf I were only still so light, that in\r    A hundred years I could advance one inch,\r    I had already started on the way,\r\rSeeking him out among this squalid folk,\r    Although the circuit be eleven miles,\r    And be not less than half a mile across.\r\rFor them am I in such a family;\r    They did induce me into coining florins,\r    Which had three carats of impurity.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92Who are the two poor wretches\r    That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,\r    Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92I found them here,\xc3\x93 replied he, \xc3\x92when I rained\r    Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,\r    Nor do I think they will for evermore.\r\rOne the false woman is who accused Joseph,\r    The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;\r    From acute fever they send forth such reek.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd one of them, who felt himself annoyed\r    At being, peradventure, named so darkly,\r    Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.\r\rIt gave a sound, as if it were a drum;\r    And Master Adam smote him in the face,\r    With arm that did not seem to be less hard,\r\rSaying to him: \xc3\x92Although be taken from me\r    All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,\r    I have an arm unfettered for such need.\xc3\x93\r\rWhereat he answer made: \xc3\x92When thou didst go\r    Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:\r    But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining.\xc3\x93\r\rThe dropsical: \xc3\x92Thou sayest true in that;\r    But thou wast not so true a witness there,\r    Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,\xc3\x93\r    Said Sinon; \xc3\x92and for one fault I am here,\r    And thou for more than any other demon.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Remember, perjurer, about the horse,\xc3\x93\r    He made reply who had the swollen belly,\r    \xc3\x92And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks\r    Thy tongue,\xc3\x93 the Greek said, \xc3\x92and the putrid water\r    That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes.\xc3\x93\r\rThen the false-coiner: \xc3\x92So is gaping wide\r    Thy mouth for speaking evil, as \xc3\x95tis wont;\r    Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me\r\rThou hast the burning and the head that aches,\r    And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus\r    Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee.\xc3\x93\r\rIn listening to them was I wholly fixed,\r    When said the Master to me: \xc3\x92Now just look,\r    For little wants it that I quarrel with thee.\xc3\x93\r\rWhen him I heard in anger speak to me,\r    I turned me round towards him with such shame\r    That still it eddies through my memory.\r\rAnd as he is who dreams of his own harm,\r    Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,\r    So that he craves what is, as if it were not;\r\rSuch I became, not having power to speak,\r    For to excuse myself I wished, and still\r    Excused myself, and did not think I did it.\r\r\xc3\x92Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,\xc3\x93\r    The Master said, \xc3\x92than this of thine has been;\r    Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,\r\rAnd make account that I am aye beside thee,\r    If e\xc3\x95er it come to pass that fortune bring thee\r    Where there are people in a like dispute;\r\rFor a base wish it is to wish to hear it.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXXI\r\r\rOne and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,\r    So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,\r    And then held out to me the medicine;\r\rThus do I hear that once Achilles\xc3\x95 spear,\r    His and his father\xc3\x95s, used to be the cause\r    First of a sad and then a gracious boon.\r\rWe turned our backs upon the wretched valley,\r    Upon the bank that girds it round about,\r    Going across it without any speech.\r\rThere it was less than night, and less than day,\r    So that my sight went little in advance;\r    But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,\r\rSo loud it would have made each thunder faint,\r    Which, counter to it following its way,\r    Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.\r\rAfter the dolorous discomfiture\r    When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,\r    So terribly Orlando sounded not.\r\rShort while my head turned thitherward I held\r    When many lofty towers I seemed to see,\r    Whereat I: \xc3\x92Master, say, what town is this?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Because thou peerest forth\r    Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,\r    It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.\r\rWell shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,\r    How much the sense deceives itself by distance;\r    Therefore a little faster spur thee on.\xc3\x93\r\rThen tenderly he took me by the hand,\r    And said: \xc3\x92Before we farther have advanced,\r    That the reality may seem to thee\r\rLess strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,\r    And they are in the well, around the bank,\r    From navel downward, one and all of them.\xc3\x93\r\rAs, when the fog is vanishing away,\r    Little by little doth the sight refigure\r    Whate\xc3\x95er the mist that crowds the air conceals,\r\rSo, piercing through the dense and darksome air,\r    More and more near approaching tow\xc3\x95rd the verge,\r    My error fled, and fear came over me;\r\rBecause as on its circular parapets\r    Montereggione crowns itself with towers,\r    E\xc3\x95en thus the margin which surrounds the well\r\rWith one half of their bodies turreted\r    The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces\r    E\xc3\x95en now from out the heavens when he thunders.\r\rAnd I of one already saw the face,\r    Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,\r    And down along his sides both of the arms.\r\rCertainly Nature, when she left the making\r    Of animals like these, did well indeed,\r    By taking such executors from Mars;\r\rAnd if of elephants and whales she doth not\r    Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly\r    More just and more discreet will hold her for it;\r\rFor where the argument of intellect\r    Is added unto evil will and power,\r    No rampart can the people make against it.\r\rHis face appeared to me as long and large\r    As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter\xc3\x95s,\r    And in proportion were the other bones;\r\rSo that the margin, which an apron was\r    Down from the middle, showed so much of him\r    Above it, that to reach up to his hair\r\rThree Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;\r    For I beheld thirty great palms of him\r    Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.\r\r\xc3\x92Raphael mai amech izabi almi,\xc3\x93\r    Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,\r    To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.\r\rAnd unto him my Guide: \xc3\x92Soul idiotic,\r    Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,\r    When wrath or other passion touches thee.\r\rSearch round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt\r    Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,\r    And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast.\xc3\x93\r\rThen said to me: \xc3\x92He doth himself accuse;\r    This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought\r    One language in the world is not still used.\r\rHere let us leave him and not speak in vain;\r    For even such to him is every language\r    As his to others, which to none is known.\xc3\x93\r\rTherefore a longer journey did we make,\r    Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft\r    We found another far more fierce and large.\r\rIn binding him, who might the master be\r    I cannot say; but he had pinioned close\r    Behind the right arm, and in front the other,\r\rWith chains, that held him so begirt about\r    From the neck down, that on the part uncovered\r    It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.\r\r\xc3\x92This proud one wished to make experiment\r    Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,\xc3\x93\r    My Leader said, \xc3\x92whence he has such a guerdon.\r\rEphialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.\r    What time the giants terrified the gods;\r    The arms he wielded never more he moves.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92If possible, I should wish\r    That of the measureless Briareus\r    These eyes of mine might have experience.\xc3\x93\r\rWhence he replied: \xc3\x92Thou shalt behold Antaeus\r    Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,\r    Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.\r\rMuch farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,\r    And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,\r    Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious.\xc3\x93\r\rThere never was an earthquake of such might\r    That it could shake a tower so violently,\r    As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.\r\rThen was I more afraid of death than ever,\r    For nothing more was needful than the fear,\r    If I had not beheld the manacles.\r\rThen we proceeded farther in advance,\r    And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells\r    Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.\r\r\xc3\x92O thou, who in the valley fortunate,\r    Which Scipio the heir of glory made,\r    When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,\r\rOnce brought\xc3\x95st a thousand lions for thy prey,\r    And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war\r    Among thy brothers, some it seems still think\r\rThe sons of Earth the victory would have gained:\r    Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,\r    There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.\r\rMake us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;\r    This one can give of that which here is longed for;\r    Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.\r\rStill in the world can he restore thy fame;\r    Because he lives, and still expects long life,\r    If to itself Grace call him not untimely.\xc3\x93\r\rSo said the Master; and in haste the other\r    His hands extended and took up my Guide,\xc3\x91\r    Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.\r\rVirgilius, when he felt himself embraced,\r    Said unto me: \xc3\x92Draw nigh, that I may take thee;\xc3\x93\r    Then of himself and me one bundle made.\r\rAs seems the Carisenda, to behold\r    Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud\r    Above it so that opposite it hangs;\r\rSuch did Antaeus seem to me, who stood\r    Watching to see him stoop, and then it was\r    I could have wished to go some other way.\r\rBut lightly in the abyss, which swallows up\r    Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;\r    Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,\r\rBut, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXXII\r\r\rIf I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,\r    As were appropriate to the dismal hole\r    Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,\r\rI would press out the juice of my conception\r    More fully; but because I have them not,\r    Not without fear I bring myself to speak;\r\rFor \xc3\x95tis no enterprise to take in jest,\r    To sketch the bottom of all the universe,\r    Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.\r\rBut may those Ladies help this verse of mine,\r    Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,\r    That from the fact the word be not diverse.\r\rO rabble ill-begotten above all,\r    Who\xc3\x95re in the place to speak of which is hard,\r    \xc3\x95Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!\r\rWhen we were down within the darksome well,\r    Beneath the giant\xc3\x95s feet, but lower far,\r    And I was scanning still the lofty wall,\r\rI heard it said to me: \xc3\x92Look how thou steppest!\r    Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet\r    The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!\xc3\x93\r\rWhereat I turned me round, and saw before me\r    And underfoot a lake, that from the frost\r    The semblance had of glass, and not of water.\r\rSo thick a veil ne\xc3\x95er made upon its current\r    In winter-time Danube in Austria,\r    Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,\r\rAs there was here; so that if Tambernich\r    Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,\r    E\xc3\x95en at the edge \xc3\x95twould not have given a creak.\r\rAnd as to croak the frog doth place himself\r    With muzzle out of water,\xc3\x91when is dreaming\r    Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,\xc3\x91\r\rLivid, as far down as where shame appears,\r    Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,\r    Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.\r\rEach one his countenance held downward bent;\r    From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart\r    Among them witness of itself procures.\r\rWhen round about me somewhat I had looked,\r    I downward turned me, and saw two so close,\r    The hair upon their heads together mingled.\r\r\xc3\x92Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,\xc3\x93\r    I said, \xc3\x92who are you;\xc3\x93 and they bent their necks,\r    And when to me their faces they had lifted,\r\rTheir eyes, which first were only moist within,\r    Gushed o\xc3\x95er the eyelids, and the frost congealed\r    The tears between, and locked them up again.\r\rClamp never bound together wood with wood\r    So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,\r    Butted together, so much wrath o\xc3\x95ercame them.\r\rAnd one, who had by reason of the cold\r    Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,\r    Said: \xc3\x92Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?\r\rIf thou desire to know who these two are,\r    The valley whence Bisenzio descends\r    Belonged to them and to their father Albert.\r\rThey from one body came, and all Caina\r    Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade\r    More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;\r\rNot he in whom were broken breast and shadow\r    At one and the same blow by Arthur\xc3\x95s hand;\r    Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers\r\rSo with his head I see no farther forward,\r    And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;\r    Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.\r\rAnd that thou put me not to further speech,\r    Know that I Camicion de\xc3\x95 Pazzi was,\r    And wait Carlino to exonerate me.\xc3\x93\r\rThen I beheld a thousand faces, made\r    Purple with cold; whence o\xc3\x95er me comes a shudder,\r    And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.\r\rAnd while we were advancing tow\xc3\x95rds the middle,\r    Where everything of weight unites together,\r    And I was shivering in the eternal shade,\r\rWhether \xc3\x95twere will, or destiny, or chance,\r    I know not; but in walking \xc3\x95mong the heads\r    I struck my foot hard in the face of one.\r\rWeeping he growled: \xc3\x92Why dost thou trample me?\r    Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance\r    of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92My Master, now wait here for me,\r    That I through him may issue from a doubt;\r    Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish.\xc3\x93\r\rThe Leader stopped; and to that one I said\r    Who was blaspheming vehemently still:\r    \xc3\x92Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora\r    Smiting,\xc3\x93 replied he, \xc3\x92other people\xc3\x95s cheeks,\r    So that, if thou wert living, \xc3\x95twere too much?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,\xc3\x93\r    Was my response, \xc3\x92if thou demandest fame,\r    That \xc3\x95mid the other notes thy name I place.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92For the reverse I long;\r    Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;\r    For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow.\xc3\x93\r\rThen by the scalp behind I seized upon him,\r    And said: \xc3\x92It must needs be thou name thyself,\r    Or not a hair remain upon thee here.\xc3\x93\r\rWhence he to me: \xc3\x92Though thou strip off my hair,\r    I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,\r    If on my head a thousand times thou fall.\xc3\x93\r\rI had his hair in hand already twisted,\r    And more than one shock of it had pulled out,\r    He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,\r\rWhen cried another: \xc3\x92What doth ail thee, Bocca?\r    Is\xc3\x95t not enough to clatter with thy jaws,\r    But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Now,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92I care not to have thee speak,\r    Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame\r    I will report of thee veracious news.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Begone,\xc3\x93 replied he, \xc3\x92and tell what thou wilt,\r    But be not silent, if thou issue hence,\r    Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;\r\rHe weepeth here the silver of the French;\r    \xc3\x94I saw,\xc3\x95 thus canst thou phrase it, \xc3\x94him of Duera\r    There where the sinners stand out in the cold.\xc3\x95\r\rIf thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,\r    Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,\r    Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;\r\rGianni del Soldanier, I think, may be\r    Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello\r    Who oped Faenza when the people slep.\xc3\x93\r\rAlready we had gone away from him,\r    When I beheld two frozen in one hole,\r    So that one head a hood was to the other;\r\rAnd even as bread through hunger is devoured,\r    The uppermost on the other set his teeth,\r    There where the brain is to the nape united.\r\rNot in another fashion Tydeus gnawed\r    The temples of Menalippus in disdain,\r    Than that one did the skull and the other things.\r\r\xc3\x92O thou, who showest by such bestial sign\r    Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,\r    Tell me the wherefore,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92with this compact,\r\rThat if thou rightfully of him complain,\r    In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,\r    I in the world above repay thee for it,\r\rIf that wherewith I speak be not dried up.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXXIII\r\r\rHis mouth uplifted from his grim repast,\r    That sinner, wiping it upon the hair\r    Of the same head that he behind had wasted.\r\rThen he began: \xc3\x92Thou wilt that I renew\r    The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already\r    To think of only, ere I speak of it;\r\rBut if my words be seed that may bear fruit\r    Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,\r    Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.\r\rI know not who thou art, nor by what mode\r    Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine\r    Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.\r\rThou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,\r    And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;\r    Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.\r\rThat, by effect of his malicious thoughts,\r    Trusting in him I was made prisoner,\r    And after put to death, I need not say;\r\r But ne\xc3\x95ertheless what thou canst not have heard,\r    That is to say, how cruel was my death,\r    Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.\r\rA narrow perforation in the mew,\r    Which bears because of me the title of Famine,\r    And in which others still must be locked up,\r\rHad shown me through its opening many moons\r    Already, when I dreamed the evil dream\r    Which of the future rent for me the veil.\r\rThis one appeared to me as lord and master,\r    Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain\r    For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.\r\rWith sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,\r    Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi\r    He had sent out before him to the front.\r\rAfter brief course seemed unto me forespent\r    The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes\r    It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.\r\rWhen I before the morrow was awake,\r    Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons\r    Who with me were, and asking after bread.\r\rCruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,\r    Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,\r    And weep\xc3\x95st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?\r\rThey were awake now, and the hour drew nigh\r    At which our food used to be brought to us,\r    And through his dream was each one apprehensive;\r\rAnd I heard locking up the under door\r    Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word\r    I gazed into the faces of my sons.\r\rI wept not, I within so turned to stone;\r    They wept; and darling little Anselm mine\r    Said: \xc3\x94Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?\xc3\x95\r\rStill not a tear I shed, nor answer made\r    All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,\r    Until another sun rose on the world.\r\rAs now a little glimmer made its way\r    Into the dolorous prison, and I saw\r    Upon four faces my own very aspect,\r\rBoth of my hands in agony I bit;\r    And, thinking that I did it from desire\r    Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,\r\rAnd said they: \xc3\x94Father, much less pain \xc3\x95twill give us\r    If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us\r    With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.\xc3\x95\r\rI calmed me then, not to make them more sad.\r    That day we all were silent, and the next.\r    Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?\r\rWhen we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo\r    Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,\r    Saying, \xc3\x94My father, why dost thou not help me?\xc3\x95\r\rAnd there he died; and, as thou seest me,\r    I saw the three fall, one by one, between\r    The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,\r\rAlready blind, to groping over each,\r    And three days called them after they were dead;\r    Then hunger did what sorrow could not do.\xc3\x93\r\rWhen he had said this, with his eyes distorted,\r    The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,\r    Which, as a dog\xc3\x95s, upon the bone were strong.\r\rAh! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people\r    Of the fair land there where the \xc3\x94Si\xc3\x95 doth sound,\r    Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,\r\rLet the Capraia and Gorgona move,\r    And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno\r    That every person in thee it may drown!\r\rFor if Count Ugolino had the fame\r    Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,\r    Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.\r\rGuiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!\r    Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,\r    And the other two my song doth name above!\r\rWe passed still farther onward, where the ice\r    Another people ruggedly enswathes,\r    Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.\r\rWeeping itself there does not let them weep,\r    And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes\r    Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;\r\rBecause the earliest tears a cluster form,\r    And, in the manner of a crystal visor,\r    Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.\r\rAnd notwithstanding that, as in a callus,\r    Because of cold all sensibility\r    Its station had abandoned in my face,\r\rStill it appeared to me I felt some wind;\r    Whence I: \xc3\x92My Master, who sets this in motion?\r    Is not below here every vapour quenched?\xc3\x93\r\rWhence he to me: \xc3\x92Full soon shalt thou be where\r    Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,\r    Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd one of the wretches of the frozen crust\r    Cried out to us: \xc3\x92O souls so merciless\r    That the last post is given unto you,\r\rLift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I\r    May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart\r    A little, e\xc3\x95er the weeping recongeal.\xc3\x93\r\rWhence I to him: \xc3\x92If thou wouldst have me help thee\r    Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,\r    May I go to the bottom of the ice.\xc3\x93\r\rThen he replied: \xc3\x92I am Friar Alberigo;\r    He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,\r    Who here a date am getting for my fig.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O,\xc3\x93 said I to him, \xc3\x92now art thou, too, dead?\xc3\x93\r    And he to me: \xc3\x92How may my body fare\r    Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.\r\rSuch an advantage has this Ptolomaea,\r    That oftentimes the soul descendeth here\r    Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.\r\rAnd, that thou mayest more willingly remove\r    From off my countenance these glassy tears,\r    Know that as soon as any soul betrays\r\rAs I have done, his body by a demon\r    Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,\r    Until his time has wholly been revolved.\r\rItself down rushes into such a cistern;\r    And still perchance above appears the body\r    Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.\r\rThis thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;\r    It is Ser Branca d\xc3\x95 Oria, and many years\r    Have passed away since he was thus locked up.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92I think,\xc3\x93 said I to him, \xc3\x92thou dost deceive me;\r    For Branca d\xc3\x95 Oria is not dead as yet,\r    And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92In moat above,\xc3\x93 said he, \xc3\x92of Malebranche,\r    There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,\r    As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,\r\rWhen this one left a devil in his stead\r    In his own body and one near of kin,\r    Who made together with him the betrayal.\r\rBut hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,\r    Open mine eyes;\xc3\x93\xc3\x91and open them I did not,\r    And to be rude to him was courtesy.\r\rAh, Genoese! ye men at variance\r    With every virtue, full of every vice\r    Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?\r\rFor with the vilest spirit of Romagna\r    I found of you one such, who for his deeds\r    In soul already in Cocytus bathes,\r\rAnd still above in body seems alive!\r\r\r\r\rInferno: Canto XXXIV\r\r\r\xc3\x92\xc3\x94Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni\xc3\x95\r    Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,\xc3\x93\r    My Master said, \xc3\x92if thou discernest him.\xc3\x93\r\rAs, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when\r    Our hemisphere is darkening into night,\r    Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,\r\rMethought that such a building then I saw;\r    And, for the wind, I drew myself behind\r    My Guide, because there was no other shelter.\r\rNow was I, and with fear in verse I put it,\r    There where the shades were wholly covered up,\r    And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.\r\rSome prone are lying, others stand erect,\r    This with the head, and that one with the soles;\r    Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.\r\rWhen in advance so far we had proceeded,\r    That it my Master pleased to show to me\r    The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,\r\rHe from before me moved and made me stop,\r    Saying: \xc3\x92Behold Dis, and behold the place\r    Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself.\xc3\x93\r\rHow frozen I became and powerless then,\r    Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,\r    Because all language would be insufficient.\r\rI did not die, and I alive remained not;\r    Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,\r    What I became, being of both deprived.\r\rThe Emperor of the kingdom dolorous\r    From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;\r    And better with a giant I compare\r\rThan do the giants with those arms of his;\r    Consider now how great must be that whole,\r    Which unto such a part conforms itself.\r\rWere he as fair once, as he now is foul,\r    And lifted up his brow against his Maker,\r    Well may proceed from him all tribulation.\r\rO, what a marvel it appeared to me,\r    When I beheld three faces on his head!\r    The one in front, and that vermilion was;\r\rTwo were the others, that were joined with this\r    Above the middle part of either shoulder,\r    And they were joined together at the crest;\r\rAnd the right-hand one seemed \xc3\x95twixt white and yellow;\r    The left was such to look upon as those\r    Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.\r\rUnderneath each came forth two mighty wings,\r    Such as befitting were so great a bird;\r    Sails of the sea I never saw so large.\r\r No feathers had they, but as of a bat\r    Their fashion was; and he was waving them,\r    So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.\r\rThereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.\r    With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins\r    Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.\r\rAt every mouth he with his teeth was crunching\r    A sinner, in the manner of a brake,\r    So that he three of them tormented thus.\r\rTo him in front the biting was as naught\r    Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine\r    Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.\r\r\xc3\x92That soul up there which has the greatest pain,\xc3\x93\r    The Master said, \xc3\x92is Judas Iscariot;\r    With head inside, he plies his legs without.\r\rOf the two others, who head downward are,\r    The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;\r    See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.\r\rAnd the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.\r    But night is reascending, and \xc3\x95tis time\r    That we depart, for we have seen the whole.\xc3\x93\r\rAs seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,\r    And he the vantage seized of time and place,\r    And when the wings were opened wide apart,\r\rHe laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;\r    From fell to fell descended downward then\r    Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.\r\rWhen we were come to where the thigh revolves\r    Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,\r    The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,\r\rTurned round his head where he had had his legs,\r    And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,\r    So that to Hell I thought we were returning.\r\r\xc3\x92Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,\xc3\x93\r    The Master said, panting as one fatigued,\r    \xc3\x92Must we perforce depart from so much evil.\xc3\x93\r\rThen through the opening of a rock he issued,\r    And down upon the margin seated me;\r    Then tow\xc3\x95rds me he outstretched his wary step.\r\rI lifted up mine eyes and thought to see\r    Lucifer in the same way I had left him;\r    And I beheld him upward hold his legs.\r\rAnd if I then became disquieted,\r    Let stolid people think who do not see\r    What the point is beyond which I had passed.\r\r\xc3\x92Rise up,\xc3\x93 the Master said, \xc3\x92upon thy feet;\r    The way is long, and difficult the road,\r    And now the sun to middle-tierce returns.\xc3\x93\r\rIt was not any palace corridor\r    There where we were, but dungeon natural,\r    With floor uneven and unease of light.\r\r\xc3\x92Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,\r    My Master,\xc3\x93 said I when I had arisen,\r    \xc3\x92To draw me from an error speak a little;\r\rWhere is the ice? and how is this one fixed\r    Thus upside down? and how in such short time\r    From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Thou still imaginest\r    Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped\r    The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.\r\rThat side thou wast, so long as I descended;\r    When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point\r    To which things heavy draw from every side,\r\rAnd now beneath the hemisphere art come\r    Opposite that which overhangs the vast\r    Dry-land, and \xc3\x95neath whose cope was put to death\r\rThe Man who without sin was born and lived.\r    Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere\r    Which makes the other face of the Judecca.\r\rHere it is morn when it is evening there;\r    And he who with his hair a stairway made us\r    Still fixed remaineth as he was before.\r\rUpon this side he fell down out of heaven;\r    And all the land, that whilom here emerged,\r    For fear of him made of the sea a veil,\r\rAnd came to our hemisphere; and peradventure\r    To flee from him, what on this side appears\r    Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled.\xc3\x93\r\rA place there is below, from Beelzebub\r    As far receding as the tomb extends,\r    Which not by sight is known, but by the sound\r\rOf a small rivulet, that there descendeth\r    Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed\r    With course that winds about and slightly falls.\r\rThe Guide and I into that hidden road\r    Now entered, to return to the bright world;\r    And without care of having any rest\r\rWe mounted up, he first and I the second,\r    Till I beheld through a round aperture\r    Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;\r\rThence we came forth to rebehold the stars.\r\r\r\r\rPURGATORIO\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto I\r\r\rTo run o\xc3\x95er better waters hoists its sail\r    The little vessel of my genius now,\r    That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;\r\rAnd of that second kingdom will I sing\r    Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,\r    And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.\r\rBut let dead Poesy here rise again,\r    O holy Muses, since that I am yours,\r    And here Calliope somewhat ascend,\r\rMy song accompanying with that sound,\r    Of which the miserable magpies felt\r    The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.\r\rSweet colour of the oriental sapphire,\r    That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect\r    Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,\r\rUnto mine eyes did recommence delight\r    Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,\r    Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.\r\rThe beauteous planet, that to love incites,\r    Was making all the orient to laugh,\r    Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.\r\rTo the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind\r    Upon the other pole, and saw four stars\r    Ne\xc3\x95er seen before save by the primal people.\r\rRejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.\r    O thou septentrional and widowed site,\r    Because thou art deprived of seeing these!\r\rWhen from regarding them I had withdrawn,\r    Turning a little to the other pole,\r    There where the Wain had disappeared already,\r\rI saw beside me an old man alone,\r    Worthy of so much reverence in his look,\r    That more owes not to father any son.\r\rA long beard and with white hair intermingled\r    He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,\r    Of which a double list fell on his breast.\r\rThe rays of the four consecrated stars\r    Did so adorn his countenance with light,\r    That him I saw as were the sun before him.\r\r\xc3\x92Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,\r    Have fled away from the eternal prison?\xc3\x93\r    Moving those venerable plumes, he said:\r\r\xc3\x92Who guided you? or who has been your lamp\r    In issuing forth out of the night profound,\r    That ever black makes the infernal valley?\r\rThe laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?\r    Or is there changed in heaven some council new,\r    That being damned ye come unto my crags?\xc3\x93\r\rThen did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,\r    And with his words, and with his hands and signs,\r    Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;\r\rThen answered him: \xc3\x92I came not of myself;\r    A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers\r    I aided this one with my company.\r\rBut since it is thy will more be unfolded\r    Of our condition, how it truly is,\r    Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.\r\rThis one has never his last evening seen,\r    But by his folly was so near to it\r    That very little time was there to turn.\r\rAs I have said, I unto him was sent\r    To rescue him, and other way was none\r    Than this to which I have myself betaken.\r\rI\xc3\x95ve shown him all the people of perdition,\r    And now those spirits I intend to show\r    Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.\r\rHow I have brought him would be long to tell thee.\r    Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me\r    To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.\r\rNow may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;\r    He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,\r    As knoweth he who life for her refuses.\r\rThou know\xc3\x95st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter\r    Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave\r    The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.\r\rBy us the eternal edicts are not broken;\r    Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;\r    But of that circle I, where are the chaste\r\rEyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,\r    O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;\r    For her love, then, incline thyself to us.\r\rPermit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;\r    I will take back this grace from thee to her,\r    If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes\r    While I was on the other side,\xc3\x93 then said he,\r    \xc3\x92That every grace she wished of me I granted;\r\rNow that she dwells beyond the evil river,\r    She can no longer move me, by that law\r    Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.\r\rBut if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,\r    As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;\r    Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.\r\rGo, then, and see thou gird this one about\r    With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,\r    So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,\r\rFor \xc3\x95twere not fitting that the eye o\xc3\x95ercast\r    By any mist should go before the first\r    Angel, who is of those of Paradise.\r\rThis little island round about its base\r    Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,\r    Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;\r\rNo other plant that putteth forth the leaf,\r    Or that doth indurate, can there have life,\r    Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.\r\rThereafter be not this way your return;\r    The sun, which now is rising, will direct you\r    To take the mount by easier ascent.\xc3\x93\r\rWith this he vanished; and I raised me up\r    Without a word, and wholly drew myself\r    Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.\r\rAnd he began: \xc3\x92Son, follow thou my steps;\r    Let us turn back, for on this side declines\r    The plain unto its lower boundaries.\xc3\x93\r\rThe dawn was vanquishing the matin hour\r    Which fled before it, so that from afar\r    I recognised the trembling of the sea.\r\rAlong the solitary plain we went\r    As one who unto the lost road returns,\r    And till he finds it seems to go in vain.\r\rAs soon as we were come to where the dew\r    Fights with the sun, and, being in a part\r    Where shadow falls, little evaporates,\r\rBoth of his hands upon the grass outspread\r    In gentle manner did my Master place;\r    Whence I, who of his action was aware,\r\rExtended unto him my tearful cheeks;\r    There did he make in me uncovered wholly\r    That hue which Hell had covered up in me.\r\rThen came we down upon the desert shore\r    Which never yet saw navigate its waters\r    Any that afterward had known return.\r\rThere he begirt me as the other pleased;\r    O marvellous! for even as he culled\r    The humble plant, such it sprang up again\r\rSuddenly there where he uprooted it.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto II\r\r\rAlready had the sun the horizon reached\r    Whose circle of meridian covers o\xc3\x95er\r    Jerusalem with its most lofty point,\r\rAnd night that opposite to him revolves\r    Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales\r    That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;\r\rSo that the white and the vermilion cheeks\r    Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,\r    By too great age were changing into orange.\r\rWe still were on the border of the sea,\r    Like people who are thinking of their road,\r    Who go in heart and with the body stay;\r\rAnd lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,\r    Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red\r    Down in the West upon the ocean floor,\r\rAppeared to me\xc3\x91may I again behold it!\xc3\x91\r    A light along the sea so swiftly coming,\r    Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;\r\rFrom which when I a little had withdrawn\r    Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,\r    Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.\r\rThen on each side of it appeared to me\r    I knew not what of white, and underneath it\r    Little by little there came forth another.\r\rMy Master yet had uttered not a word\r    While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;\r    But when he clearly recognised the pilot,\r\rHe cried: \xc3\x92Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!\r    Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!\r    Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!\r\rSee how he scorneth human arguments,\r    So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail\r    Than his own wings, between so distant shores.\r\rSee how he holds them pointed up to heaven,\r    Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,\r    That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!\xc3\x93\r\rThen as still nearer and more near us came\r    The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,\r    So that near by the eye could not endure him,\r\rBut down I cast it; and he came to shore\r    With a small vessel, very swift and light,\r    So that the water swallowed naught thereof.\r\rUpon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;\r    Beatitude seemed written in his face,\r    And more than a hundred spirits sat within.\r\r\xc3\x92In exitu Israel de Aegypto!\xc3\x93\r    They chanted all together in one voice,\r    With whatso in that psalm is after written.\r\rThen made he sign of holy rood upon them,\r    Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,\r    And he departed swiftly as he came.\r\rThe throng which still remained there unfamiliar\r    Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,\r    As one who in new matters makes essay.\r\rOn every side was darting forth the day.\r    The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts\r    From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,\r\rWhen the new people lifted up their faces\r    Towards us, saying to us: \xc3\x92If ye know,\r    Show us the way to go unto the mountain.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd answer made Virgilius: \xc3\x92Ye believe\r    Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,\r    But we are strangers even as yourselves.\r\rJust now we came, a little while before you,\r    Another way, which was so rough and steep,\r    That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.\xc3\x93\r\rThe souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,\r    Become aware that I was still alive,\r    Pallid in their astonishment became;\r\rAnd as to messenger who bears the olive\r    The people throng to listen to the news,\r    And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,\r\rSo at the sight of me stood motionless\r    Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if\r    Oblivious to go and make them fair.\r\rOne from among them saw I coming forward,\r    As to embrace me, with such great affection,\r    That it incited me to do the like.\r\rO empty shadows, save in aspect only!\r    Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,\r    As oft returned with them to my own breast!\r\rI think with wonder I depicted me;\r    Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;\r    And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.\r\rGently it said that I should stay my steps;\r    Then knew I who it was, and I entreated\r    That it would stop awhile to speak with me.\r\rIt made reply to me: \xc3\x92Even as I loved thee\r    In mortal body, so I love thee free;\r    Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92My own Casella! to return once more\r    There where I am, I make this journey,\xc3\x93 said I;\r    \xc3\x92But how from thee has so much time be taken?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92No outrage has been done me,\r    If he who takes both when and whom he pleases\r    Has many times denied to me this passage,\r\rFor of a righteous will his own is made.\r    He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken\r    Whoever wished to enter with all peace;\r\rWhence I, who now had turned unto that shore\r    Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,\r    Benignantly by him have been received.\r\rUnto that outlet now his wing is pointed,\r    Because for evermore assemble there\r    Those who tow\xc3\x95rds Acheron do not descend.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92If some new law take not from thee\r    Memory or practice of the song of love,\r    Which used to quiet in me all my longings,\r\rThee may it please to comfort therewithal\r    Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body\r    Hitherward coming is so much distressed.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Love, that within my mind discourses with me,\xc3\x93\r    Forthwith began he so melodiously,\r    The melody within me still is sounding.\r\rMy Master, and myself, and all that people\r    Which with him were, appeared as satisfied\r    As if naught else might touch the mind of any.\r\rWe all of us were moveless and attentive\r    Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,\r    Exclaiming: \xc3\x92What is this, ye laggard spirits?\r\rWhat negligence, what standing still is this?\r    Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,\r    That lets not God be manifest to you.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as when, collecting grain or tares,\r    The doves, together at their pasture met,\r    Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,\r\rIf aught appear of which they are afraid,\r    Upon a sudden leave their food alone,\r    Because they are assailed by greater care;\r\rSo that fresh company did I behold\r    The song relinquish, and go tow\xc3\x95rds the hill,\r    As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;\r\rNor was our own departure less in haste.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto III\r\r\rInasmuch as the instantaneous flight\r    Had scattered them asunder o\xc3\x95er the plain,\r    Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,\r\rI pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,\r    And how without him had I kept my course?\r    Who would have led me up along the mountain?\r\rHe seemed to me within himself remorseful;\r    O noble conscience, and without a stain,\r    How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!\r\rAfter his feet had laid aside the haste\r    Which mars the dignity of every act,\r    My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,\r\rLet loose its faculties as if delighted,\r    And I my sight directed to the hill\r    That highest tow\xc3\x95rds the heaven uplifts itself.\r\rThe sun, that in our rear was flaming red,\r    Was broken in front of me into the figure\r    Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;\r\rUnto one side I turned me, with the fear\r    Of being left alone, when I beheld\r    Only in front of me the ground obscured.\r\r\xc3\x92Why dost thou still mistrust?\xc3\x93 my Comforter\r    Began to say to me turned wholly round;\r    \xc3\x92Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?\r\r\xc3\x95Tis evening there already where is buried\r    The body within which I cast a shadow;\r    \xc3\x95Tis from Brundusium ta\xc3\x95en, and Naples has it.\r\rNow if in front of me no shadow fall,\r    Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,\r    Because one ray impedeth not another\r\rTo suffer torments, both of cold and heat,\r    Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills\r    That how it works be not unveiled to us.\r\rInsane is he who hopeth that our reason\r    Can traverse the illimitable way,\r    Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!\r\rMortals, remain contented at the \xc3\x94Quia;\xc3\x95\r    For if ye had been able to see all,\r    No need there were for Mary to give birth;\r\rAnd ye have seen desiring without fruit,\r    Those whose desire would have been quieted,\r    Which evermore is given them for a grief.\r\rI speak of Aristotle and of Plato,\r    And many others;\xc3\x93\xc3\x91and here bowed his head,\r    And more he said not, and remained disturbed.\r\rWe came meanwhile unto the mountain\xc3\x95s foot;\r    There so precipitate we found the rock,\r    That nimble legs would there have been in vain.\r\r\xc3\x95Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,\r    The most secluded pathway is a stair\r    Easy and open, if compared with that.\r\r\xc3\x92Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill\r    Slopes down,\xc3\x93 my Master said, his footsteps staying,\r    \xc3\x92So that who goeth without wings may mount?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd while he held his eyes upon the ground\r    Examining the nature of the path,\r    And I was looking up around the rock,\r\rOn the left hand appeared to me a throng\r    Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,\r    And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.\r\r\xc3\x92Lift up thine eyes,\xc3\x93 I to the Master said;\r    \xc3\x92Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,\r    If thou of thine own self can have it not.\xc3\x93\r\rThen he looked at me, and with frank expression\r    Replied: \xc3\x92Let us go there, for they come slowly,\r    And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.\xc3\x93\r\rStill was that people as far off from us,\r    After a thousand steps of ours I say,\r    As a good thrower with his hand would reach,\r\rWhen they all crowded unto the hard masses\r    Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,\r    As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.\r\r\xc3\x92O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!\xc3\x93\r    Virgilius made beginning, \xc3\x92by that peace\r    Which I believe is waiting for you all,\r\rTell us upon what side the mountain slopes,\r    So that the going up be possible,\r    For to lose time irks him most who most knows.\xc3\x93\r\rAs sheep come issuing forth from out the fold\r    By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand\r    Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,\r\rAnd what the foremost does the others do,\r    Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,\r    Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;\r\rSo moving to approach us thereupon\r    I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,\r    Modest in face and dignified in gait.\r\rAs soon as those in the advance saw broken\r    The light upon the ground at my right side,\r    So that from me the shadow reached the rock,\r\rThey stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;\r    And all the others, who came after them,\r    Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.\r\r\xc3\x92Without your asking, I confess to you\r    This is a human body which you see,\r    Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.\r\rMarvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded\r    That not without a power which comes from Heaven\r    Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall.\xc3\x93\r\rThe Master thus; and said those worthy people:\r    \xc3\x92Return ye then, and enter in before us,\xc3\x93\r    Making a signal with the back o\xc3\x95 the hand\r\rAnd one of them began: \xc3\x92Whoe\xc3\x95er thou art,\r    Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well\r    If e\xc3\x95er thou saw me in the other world.\xc3\x93\r\rI turned me tow\xc3\x95rds him, and looked at him closely;\r    Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,\r    But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.\r\rWhen with humility I had disclaimed\r    E\xc3\x95er having seen him, \xc3\x92Now behold!\xc3\x93 he said,\r    And showed me high upon his breast a wound.\r\rThen said he with a smile: \xc3\x92I am Manfredi,\r    The grandson of the Empress Costanza;\r    Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee\r\rGo to my daughter beautiful, the mother\r    Of Sicily\xc3\x95s honour and of Aragon\xc3\x95s,\r    And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.\r\rAfter I had my body lacerated\r    By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself\r    Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.\r\rHorrible my iniquities had been;\r    But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,\r    That it receives whatever turns to it.\r\rHad but Cosenza\xc3\x95s pastor, who in chase\r    Of me was sent by Clement at that time,\r    In God read understandingly this page,\r\rThe bones of my dead body still would be\r    At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,\r    Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.\r\rNow the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,\r    Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,\r    Where he transported them with tapers quenched.\r\rBy malison of theirs is not so lost\r    Eternal Love, that it cannot return,\r    So long as hope has anything of green.\r\rTrue is it, who in contumacy dies\r    Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,\r    Must wait upon the outside this bank\r\rThirty times told the time that he has been\r    In his presumption, unless such decree\r    Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.\r\rSee now if thou hast power to make me happy,\r    By making known unto my good Costanza\r    How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,\r\rFor those on earth can much advance us here.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto IV\r\r\rWhenever by delight or else by pain,\r    That seizes any faculty of ours,\r    Wholly to that the soul collects itself,\r\rIt seemeth that no other power it heeds;\r    And this against that error is which thinks\r    One soul above another kindles in us.\r\rAnd hence, whenever aught is heard or seen\r    Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,\r    Time passes on, and we perceive it not,\r\rBecause one faculty is that which listens,\r    And other that which the soul keeps entire;\r    This is as if in bonds, and that is free.\r\rOf this I had experience positive\r    In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;\r    For fifty full degrees uprisen was\r\rThe sun, and I had not perceived it, when\r    We came to where those souls with one accord\r    Cried out unto us: \xc3\x92Here is what you ask.\xc3\x93\r\rA greater opening ofttimes hedges up\r    With but a little forkful of his thorns\r    The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,\r\rThan was the passage-way through which ascended\r    Only my Leader and myself behind him,\r    After that company departed from us.\r\rOne climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,\r    And mounts the summit of Bismantova,\r    With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;\r\rWith the swift pinions and the plumes I say\r    Of great desire, conducted after him\r    Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.\r\rWe mounted upward through the rifted rock,\r    And on each side the border pressed upon us,\r    And feet and hands the ground beneath required.\r\rWhen we were come upon the upper rim\r    Of the high bank, out on the open slope,\r    \xc3\x92My Master,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92what way shall we take?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92No step of thine descend;\r    Still up the mount behind me win thy way,\r    Till some sage escort shall appear to us.\xc3\x93\r\rThe summit was so high it vanquished sight,\r    And the hillside precipitous far more\r    Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.\r\rSpent with fatigue was I, when I began:\r    \xc3\x92O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold\r    How I remain alone, unless thou stay!\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O son,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92up yonder drag thyself,\xc3\x93\r    Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,\r    Which on that side encircles all the hill.\r\rThese words of his so spurred me on, that I\r    Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,\r    Until the circle was beneath my feet.\r\rThereon ourselves we seated both of us\r    Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,\r    For all men are delighted to look back.\r\rTo the low shores mine eyes I first directed,\r    Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered\r    That on the left hand we were smitten by it.\r\rThe Poet well perceived that I was wholly\r    Bewildered at the chariot of the light,\r    Where \xc3\x95twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.\r\rWhereon he said to me: \xc3\x92If Castor and Pollux\r    Were in the company of yonder mirror,\r    That up and down conducteth with its light,\r\rThou wouldst behold the zodiac\xc3\x95s jagged wheel\r    Revolving still more near unto the Bears,\r    Unless it swerved aside from its old track.\r\rHow that may be wouldst thou have power to think,\r    Collected in thyself, imagine Zion\r    Together with this mount on earth to stand,\r\rSo that they both one sole horizon have,\r    And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road\r    Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,\r\rThou\xc3\x95lt see how of necessity must pass\r    This on one side, when that upon the other,\r    If thine intelligence right clearly heed.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Truly, my Master,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92never yet\r    Saw I so clearly as I now discern,\r    There where my wit appeared incompetent,\r\rThat the mid-circle of supernal motion,\r    Which in some art is the Equator called,\r    And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,\r\rFor reason which thou sayest, departeth hence\r    Tow\xc3\x95rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews\r    Beheld it tow\xc3\x95rds the region of the heat.\r\rBut, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn\r    How far we have to go; for the hill rises\r    Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92This mount is such, that ever\r    At the beginning down below \xc3\x95tis tiresome,\r    And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.\r\rTherefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,\r    That going up shall be to thee as easy\r    As going down the current in a boat,\r\rThen at this pathway\xc3\x95s ending thou wilt be;\r    There to repose thy panting breath expect;\r    No more I answer; and this I know for true.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd as he finished uttering these words,\r    A voice close by us sounded: \xc3\x92Peradventure\r    Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.\xc3\x93\r\rAt sound thereof each one of us turned round,\r    And saw upon the left hand a great rock,\r    Which neither I nor he before had noticed.\r\rThither we drew; and there were persons there\r    Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,\r    As one through indolence is wont to stand.\r\rAnd one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,\r    Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,\r    Holding his face low down between them bowed.\r\r\xc3\x92O my sweet Lord,\xc3\x93 I said, \xc3\x92do turn thine eye\r    On him who shows himself more negligent\r    Then even Sloth herself his sister were.\xc3\x93\r\rThen he turned round to us, and he gave heed,\r    Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,\r    And said: \xc3\x92Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.\xc3\x93\r\rThen knew I who he was; and the distress,\r    That still a little did my breathing quicken,\r    My going to him hindered not; and after\r\rI came to him he hardly raised his head,\r    Saying: \xc3\x92Hast thou seen clearly how the sun\r    O\xc3\x95er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?\xc3\x93\r\rHis sluggish attitude and his curt words\r    A little unto laughter moved my lips;\r    Then I began: \xc3\x92Belacqua, I grieve not\r\rFor thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated\r    In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?\r    Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he: \xc3\x92O brother, what\xc3\x95s the use of climbing?\r    Since to my torment would not let me go\r    The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.\r\rFirst heaven must needs so long revolve me round\r    Outside thereof, as in my life it did,\r    Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,\r\rUnless, e\xc3\x95er that, some prayer may bring me aid\r    Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;\r    What profit others that in heaven are heard not?\xc3\x93\r\rMeanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,\r    And saying: \xc3\x92Come now; see the sun has touched\r    Meridian, and from the shore the night\r\rCovers already with her foot Morocco.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto V\r\r\rI had already from those shades departed,\r    And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,\r    When from behind, pointing his finger at me,\r\rOne shouted: \xc3\x92See, it seems as if shone not\r    The sunshine on the left of him below,\r    And like one living seems he to conduct him.\xc3\x93\r\rMine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,\r    And saw them watching with astonishment\r    But me, but me, and the light which was broken!\r\r\xc3\x92Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,\xc3\x93\r    The Master said, \xc3\x92that thou thy pace dost slacken?\r    What matters it to thee what here is whispered?\r\rCome after me, and let the people talk;\r    Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags\r    Its top for all the blowing of the winds;\r\rFor evermore the man in whom is springing\r    Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,\r    Because the force of one the other weakens.\xc3\x93\r\rWhat could I say in answer but \xc3\x92I come\xc3\x93?\r    I said it somewhat with that colour tinged\r    Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.\r\rMeanwhile along the mountain-side across\r    Came people in advance of us a little,\r    Singing the Miserere verse by verse.\r\rWhen they became aware I gave no place\r    For passage of the sunshine through my body,\r    They changed their song into a long, hoarse \xc3\x92Oh!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd two of them, in form of messengers,\r    Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,\r    \xc3\x92Of your condition make us cognisant.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd said my Master: \xc3\x92Ye can go your way\r    And carry back again to those who sent you,\r    That this one\xc3\x95s body is of very flesh.\r\rIf they stood still because they saw his shadow,\r    As I suppose, enough is answered them;\r    Him let them honour, it may profit them.\xc3\x93\r\rVapours enkindled saw I ne\xc3\x95er so swiftly\r    At early nightfall cleave the air serene,\r    Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,\r\rBut upward they returned in briefer time,\r    And, on arriving, with the others wheeled\r    Tow\xc3\x95rds us, like troops that run without a rein.\r\r\xc3\x92This folk that presses unto us is great,\r    And cometh to implore thee,\xc3\x93 said the Poet;\r    \xc3\x92So still go onward, and in going listen.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O soul that goest to beatitude\r    With the same members wherewith thou wast born,\xc3\x93\r    Shouting they came, \xc3\x92a little stay thy steps,\r\rLook, if thou e\xc3\x95er hast any of us seen,\r    So that o\xc3\x95er yonder thou bear news of him;\r    Ah, why dost thou go on?  Ah, why not stay?\r\rLong since we all were slain by violence,\r    And sinners even to the latest hour;\r    Then did a light from heaven admonish us,\r\rSo that, both penitent and pardoning, forth\r    From life we issued reconciled to God,\r    Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92Although I gaze into your faces,\r    No one I recognize; but if may please you\r    Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,\r\rSpeak ye, and I will do it, by that peace\r    Which, following the feet of such a Guide,\r    From world to world makes itself sought by me.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd one began: \xc3\x92Each one has confidence\r    In thy good offices without an oath,\r    Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;\r\rWhence I, who speak alone before the others,\r    Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land\r    That \xc3\x95twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,\r\rThou be so courteous to me of thy prayers\r    In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,\r    That I may purge away my grave offences.\r\rFrom thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which\r    Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,\r    Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,\r\rThere where I thought to be the most secure;\r    \xc3\x95Twas he of Este had it done, who held me\r    In hatred far beyond what justice willed.\r\rBut if towards the Mira I had fled,\r    When I was overtaken at Oriaco,\r    I still should be o\xc3\x95er yonder where men breathe.\r\rI ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire\r    Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there\r    A lake made from my veins upon the ground.\xc3\x93\r\rThen said another: \xc3\x92Ah, be that desire\r    Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,\r    As thou with pious pity aidest mine.\r\rI was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;\r    Giovanna, nor none other cares for me;\r    Hence among these I go with downcast front.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92What violence or what chance\r    Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,\r    That never has thy sepulture been known?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Oh,\xc3\x93 he replied, \xc3\x92at Casentino\xc3\x95s foot\r    A river crosses named Archiano, born\r    Above the Hermitage in Apennine.\r\rThere where the name thereof becometh void\r    Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,\r    Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;\r\rThere my sight lost I, and my utterance\r    Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat\r    I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.\r\rTruth will I speak, repeat it to the living;\r    God\xc3\x95s Angel took me up, and he of hell\r    Shouted: \xc3\x94O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?\r\rThou bearest away the eternal part of him,\r    For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;\r    But with the rest I\xc3\x95ll deal in other fashion!\xc3\x95\r\rWell knowest thou how in the air is gathered\r    That humid vapour which to water turns,\r    Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.\r\rHe joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,\r    To intellect, and moved the mist and wind\r    By means of power, which his own nature gave;\r\rThereafter, when the day was spent, the valley\r    From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered\r    With fog, and made the heaven above intent,\r\rSo that the pregnant air to water changed;\r    Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came\r    Whate\xc3\x95er of it earth tolerated not;\r\rAnd as it mingled with the mighty torrents,\r    Towards the royal river with such speed\r    It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.\r\rMy frozen body near unto its outlet\r    The robust Archian found, and into Arno\r    Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross\r\rI made of me, when agony o\xc3\x95ercame me;\r    It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,\r    Then with its booty covered and begirt me.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,\r    And rested thee from thy long journeying,\xc3\x93\r    After the second followed the third spirit,\r\r\xc3\x92Do thou remember me who am the Pia;\r    Siena made me, unmade me Maremma;\r    He knoweth it, who had encircled first,\r\rEspousing me, my finger with his gem.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto VI\r\r\rWhene\xc3\x95er is broken up the game of Zara,\r    He who has lost remains behind despondent,\r    The throws repeating, and in sadness learns;\r\rThe people with the other all depart;\r    One goes in front, and one behind doth pluck him,\r    And at his side one brings himself to mind;\r\rHe pauses not, and this and that one hears;\r    They crowd no more to whom his hand he stretches,\r    And from the throng he thus defends himself.\r\rEven such was I in that dense multitude,\r    Turning to them this way and that my face,\r    And, promising, I freed myself therefrom.\r\rThere was the Aretine, who from the arms\r    Untamed of Ghin di Tacco had his death,\r    And he who fleeing from pursuit was drowned.\r\rThere was imploring with his hands outstretched\r    Frederick Novello, and that one of Pisa\r    Who made the good Marzucco seem so strong.\r\rI saw Count Orso; and the soul divided\r    By hatred and by envy from its body,\r    As it declared, and not for crime committed,\r\rPierre de la Brosse I say; and here provide\r    While still on earth the Lady of Brabant,\r    So that for this she be of no worse flock!\r\rAs soon as I was free from all those shades\r    Who only prayed that some one else may pray,\r    So as to hasten their becoming holy,\r\rBegan I: \xc3\x92It appears that thou deniest,\r    O light of mine, expressly in some text,\r    That orison can bend decree of Heaven;\r\rAnd ne\xc3\x95ertheless these people pray for this.\r    Might then their expectation bootless be?\r    Or is to me thy saying not quite clear?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92My writing is explicit,\r    And not fallacious is the hope of these,\r    If with sane intellect \xc3\x95tis well regarded;\r\rFor top of judgment doth not vail itself,\r    Because the fire of love fulfils at once\r    What he must satisfy who here installs him.\r\rAnd there, where I affirmed that proposition,\r    Defect was not amended by a prayer,\r    Because the prayer from God was separate.\r\rVerily, in so deep a questioning\r    Do not decide, unless she tell it thee,\r    Who light \xc3\x95twixt truth and intellect shall be.\r\rI know not if thou understand; I speak\r    Of Beatrice; her shalt thou see above,\r    Smiling and happy, on this mountain\xc3\x95s top.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92Good Leader, let us make more haste,\r    For I no longer tire me as before;\r    And see, e\xc3\x95en now the hill a shadow casts.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92We will go forward with this day\xc3\x93 he answered,\r    \xc3\x92As far as now is possible for us;\r    But otherwise the fact is than thou thinkest.\r\rEre thou art up there, thou shalt see return\r    Him, who now hides himself behind the hill,\r    So that thou dost not interrupt his rays.\r\rBut yonder there behold! a soul that stationed\r    All, all alone is looking hitherward;\r    It will point out to us the quickest way.\xc3\x93\r\rWe came up unto it; O Lombard soul,\r    How lofty and disdainful thou didst bear thee,\r    And grand and slow in moving of thine eyes!\r\rNothing whatever did it say to us,\r    But let us go our way, eying us only\r    After the manner of a couchant lion;\r\rStill near to it Virgilius drew, entreating\r    That it would point us out the best ascent;\r    And it replied not unto his demand,\r\rBut of our native land and of our life\r    It questioned us; and the sweet Guide began:\r    \xc3\x92Mantua,\xc3\x93\xc3\x91and the shade, all in itself recluse,\r\rRose tow\xc3\x95rds him from the place where first it was,\r    Saying: \xc3\x92O Mantuan, I am Sordello\r    Of thine own land!\xc3\x93 and one embraced the other.\r\rAh! servile Italy, grief\xc3\x95s hostelry!\r    A ship without a pilot in great tempest!\r    No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel!\r\rThat noble soul was so impatient, only\r    At the sweet sound of his own native land,\r    To make its citizen glad welcome there;\r\rAnd now within thee are not without war\r    Thy living ones, and one doth gnaw the other\r    Of those whom one wall and one fosse shut in!\r\rSearch, wretched one, all round about the shores\r    Thy seaboard, and then look within thy bosom,\r    If any part of thee enjoyeth peace!\r\rWhat boots it, that for thee Justinian\r    The bridle mend, if empty be the saddle?\r    Withouten this the shame would be the less.\r\rAh! people, thou that oughtest to be devout,\r    And to let Caesar sit upon the saddle,\r    If well thou hearest what God teacheth thee,\r\rBehold how fell this wild beast has become,\r    Being no longer by the spur corrected,\r    Since thou hast laid thy hand upon the bridle.\r\rO German Albert! who abandonest\r    Her that has grown recalcitrant and savage,\r    And oughtest to bestride her saddle-bow,\r\rMay a just judgment from the stars down fall\r    Upon thy blood, and be it new and open,\r    That thy successor may have fear thereof;\r\rBecause thy father and thyself have suffered,\r    By greed of those transalpine lands distrained,\r    The garden of the empire to be waste.\r\rCome and behold Montecchi and Cappelletti,\r    Monaldi and Fillippeschi, careless man!\r    Those sad already, and these doubt-depressed!\r\rCome, cruel one! come and behold the oppression\r    Of thy nobility, and cure their wounds,\r    And thou shalt see how safe is Santafiore!\r\rCome and behold thy Rome, that is lamenting,\r    Widowed, alone, and day and night exclaims,\r    \xc3\x92My Caesar, why hast thou forsaken me?\xc3\x93\r\rCome and behold how loving are the people;\r    And if for us no pity moveth thee,\r    Come and be made ashamed of thy renown!\r\rAnd if it lawful be, O Jove Supreme!\r    Who upon earth for us wast crucified,\r    Are thy just eyes averted otherwhere?\r\rOr preparation is \xc3\x95t, that, in the abyss\r    Of thine own counsel, for some good thou makest\r    From our perception utterly cut off?\r\rFor all the towns of Italy are full\r    Of tyrants, and becometh a Marcellus\r    Each peasant churl who plays the partisan!\r\rMy Florence! well mayst thou contented be\r    With this digression, which concerns thee not,\r    Thanks to thy people who such forethought take!\r\rMany at heart have justice, but shoot slowly,\r    That unadvised they come not to the bow,\r    But on their very lips thy people have it!\r\rMany refuse to bear the common burden;\r    But thy solicitous people answereth\r    Without being asked, and crieth: \xc3\x92I submit.\xc3\x93\r\rNow be thou joyful, for thou hast good reason;\r    Thou affluent, thou in peace, thou full of wisdom!\r    If I speak true, the event conceals it not.\r\rAthens and Lacedaemon, they who made\r    The ancient laws, and were so civilized,\r    Made towards living well a little sign\r\rCompared with thee, who makest such fine-spun\r    Provisions, that to middle of November\r    Reaches not what thou in October spinnest.\r\rHow oft, within the time of thy remembrance,\r    Laws, money, offices, and usages\r    Hast thou remodelled, and renewed thy members?\r\rAnd if thou mind thee well, and see the light,\r    Thou shalt behold thyself like a sick woman,\r    Who cannot find repose upon her down,\r\rBut by her tossing wardeth off her pain.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto VII\r\r\rAfter the gracious and glad salutations\r    Had three and four times been reiterated,\r    Sordello backward drew and said, \xc3\x92Who are you?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Or ever to this mountain were directed\r    The souls deserving to ascend to God,\r    My bones were buried by Octavian.\r\rI am Virgilius; and for no crime else\r    Did I lose heaven, than for not having faith;\xc3\x93\r    In this wise then my Leader made reply.\r\rAs one who suddenly before him sees\r    Something whereat he marvels, who believes\r    And yet does not, saying, \xc3\x92It is! it is not!\xc3\x93\r\rSo he appeared; and then bowed down his brow,\r    And with humility returned towards him,\r    And, where inferiors embrace, embraced him.\r\r\xc3\x92O glory of the Latians, thou,\xc3\x93 he said,\r    \xc3\x92Through whom our language showed what it could do\r    O pride eternal of the place I came from,\r\rWhat merit or what grace to me reveals thee?\r    If I to hear thy words be worthy, tell me\r    If thou dost come from Hell, and from what cloister.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Through all the circles of the doleful realm,\xc3\x93\r    Responded he, \xc3\x92have I come hitherward;\r    Heaven\xc3\x95s power impelled me, and with that I come.\r\rI by not doing, not by doing, lost\r    The sight of that high sun which thou desirest,\r    And which too late by me was recognized.\r\rA place there is below not sad with torments,\r    But darkness only, where the lamentations\r    Have not the sound of wailing, but are sighs.\r\rThere dwell I with the little innocents\r    Snatched by the teeth of Death, or ever they\r    Were from our human sinfulness exempt.\r\rThere dwell I among those who the three saintly\r    Virtues did not put on, and without vice\r    The others knew and followed all of them.\r\rBut if thou know and can, some indication\r    Give us by which we may the sooner come\r    Where Purgatory has its right beginning.\xc3\x93\r\rHe answered: \xc3\x92No fixed place has been assigned us;\r    \xc3\x95Tis lawful for me to go up and round;\r    So far as I can go, as guide I join thee.\r\rBut see already how the day declines,\r    And to go up by night we are not able;\r    Therefore \xc3\x95tis well to think of some fair sojourn.\r\rSouls are there on the right hand here withdrawn;\r    If thou permit me I will lead thee to them,\r    And thou shalt know them not without delight.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92How is this?\xc3\x93 was the answer; \xc3\x92should one wish\r    To mount by night would he prevented be\r    By others? or mayhap would not have power?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd on the ground the good Sordello drew\r    His finger, saying, \xc3\x92See, this line alone\r    Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone;\r\rNot that aught else would hindrance give, however,\r    To going up, save the nocturnal darkness;\r    This with the want of power the will perplexes.\r\rWe might indeed therewith return below,\r    And, wandering, walk the hill-side round about,\r    While the horizon holds the day imprisoned.\xc3\x93\r\rThereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said:\r    \xc3\x92Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest\r    That we can take delight in tarrying.\xc3\x93\r\rLittle had we withdrawn us from that place,\r    When I perceived the mount was hollowed out\r    In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed.\r\r\xc3\x92Thitherward,\xc3\x93 said that shade, \xc3\x92will we repair,\r    Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap,\r    And there for the new day will we await.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x95Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path\r    Which led us to the margin of that dell,\r    Where dies the border more than half away.\r\rGold and fine silver, and scarlet and pearl-white,\r    The Indian wood resplendent and serene,\r    Fresh emerald the moment it is broken,\r\rBy herbage and by flowers within that hollow\r    Planted, each one in colour would be vanquished,\r    As by its greater vanquished is the less.\r\rNor in that place had nature painted only,\r    But of the sweetness of a thousand odours\r    Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown.\r\r\xc3\x92Salve Regina,\xc3\x93 on the green and flowers\r    There seated, singing, spirits I beheld,\r    Which were not visible outside the valley.\r\r\xc3\x92Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest,\xc3\x93\r    Began the Mantuan who had led us thither,\r    \xc3\x92Among them do not wish me to conduct you.\r\rBetter from off this ledge the acts and faces\r    Of all of them will you discriminate,\r    Than in the plain below received among them.\r\rHe who sits highest, and the semblance bears\r    Of having what he should have done neglected,\r    And to the others\xc3\x95 song moves not his lips,\r\rRudolph the Emperor was, who had the power\r    To heal the wounds that Italy have slain,\r    So that through others slowly she revives.\r\rThe other, who in look doth comfort him,\r    Governed the region where the water springs,\r    The Moldau bears the Elbe, and Elbe the sea.\r\rHis name was Ottocar; and in swaddling-clothes\r    Far better he than bearded Winceslaus\r    His son, who feeds in luxury and ease.\r\rAnd the small-nosed, who close in council seems\r    With him that has an aspect so benign,\r    Died fleeing and disflowering the lily;\r\rLook there, how he is beating at his breast!\r    Behold the other one, who for his cheek\r    Sighing has made of his own palm a bed;\r\rFather and father-in-law of France\xc3\x95s Pest\r    Are they, and know his vicious life and lewd,\r    And hence proceeds the grief that so doth pierce them.\r\rHe who appears so stalwart, and chimes in,\r    Singing, with that one of the manly nose,\r    The cord of every valour wore begirt;\r\rAnd if as King had after him remained\r    The stripling who in rear of him is sitting,\r    Well had the valour passed from vase to vase,\r\rWhich cannot of the other heirs be said.\r    Frederick and Jacomo possess the realms,\r    But none the better heritage possesses.\r\rNot oftentimes upriseth through the branches\r    The probity of man; and this He wills\r    Who gives it, so that we may ask of Him.\r\rEke to the large-nosed reach my words, no less\r    Than to the other, Pier, who with him sings;\r    Whence Provence and Apulia grieve already\r\rThe plant is as inferior to its seed,\r    As more than Beatrice and Margaret\r    Costanza boasteth of her husband still.\r\rBehold the monarch of the simple life,\r    Harry of England, sitting there alone;\r    He in his branches has a better issue.\r\rHe who the lowest on the ground among them\r    Sits looking upward, is the Marquis William,\r    For whose sake Alessandria and her war\r\rMake Monferrat and Canavese weep.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto VIII\r\r\r\xc3\x95Twas now the hour that turneth back desire\r    In those who sail the sea, and melts the heart,\r    The day they\xc3\x95ve said to their sweet friends farewell,\r\rAnd the new pilgrim penetrates with love,\r    If he doth hear from far away a bell\r    That seemeth to deplore the dying day,\r\rWhen I began to make of no avail\r    My hearing, and to watch one of the souls\r    Uprisen, that begged attention with its hand.\r\rIt joined and lifted upward both its palms,\r    Fixing its eyes upon the orient,\r    As if it said to God, \xc3\x92Naught else I care for.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Te lucis ante\xc3\x93 so devoutly issued\r    Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes,\r    It made me issue forth from my own mind.\r\rAnd then the others, sweetly and devoutly,\r    Accompanied it through all the hymn entire,\r    Having their eyes on the supernal wheels.\r\rHere, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth,\r    For now indeed so subtile is the veil,\r    Surely to penetrate within is easy.\r\rI saw that army of the gentle-born\r    Thereafterward in silence upward gaze,\r    As if in expectation, pale and humble;\r\rAnd from on high come forth and down descend,\r    I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,\r    Truncated and deprived of their points.\r\rGreen as the little leaflets just now born\r    Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions\r    Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.\r\rOne just above us came to take his station,\r    And one descended to the opposite bank,\r    So that the people were contained between them.\r\rClearly in them discerned I the blond head;\r    But in their faces was the eye bewildered,\r    As faculty confounded by excess.\r\r\xc3\x92From Mary\xc3\x95s bosom both of them have come,\xc3\x93\r    Sordello said, \xc3\x92as guardians of the valley\r    Against the serpent, that will come anon.\xc3\x93\r\rWhereupon I, who knew not by what road,\r    Turned round about, and closely drew myself,\r    Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.\r\rAnd once again Sordello: \xc3\x92Now descend we\r    \xc3\x95Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;\r    Right pleasant will it be for them to see you.\xc3\x93\r\rOnly three steps I think that I descended,\r    And was below, and saw one who was looking\r    Only at me, as if he fain would know me.\r\rAlready now the air was growing dark,\r    But not so that between his eyes and mine\r    It did not show what it before locked up.\r\rTow\xc3\x95rds me he moved, and I tow\xc3\x95rds him did move;\r    Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,\r    When I beheld thee not among the damned!\r\rNo greeting fair was left unsaid between us;\r    Then asked he: \xc3\x92How long is it since thou camest\r    O\xc3\x95er the far waters to the mountain\xc3\x95s foot?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Oh!\xc3\x93 said I to him, \xc3\x92through the dismal places\r    I came this morn; and am in the first life,\r    Albeit the other, going thus, I gain.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd on the instant my reply was heard,\r    He and Sordello both shrank back from me,\r    Like people who are suddenly bewildered.\r\rOne to Virgilius, and the other turned\r    To one who sat there, crying, \xc3\x92Up, Currado!\r    Come and behold what God in grace has willed!\xc3\x93\r\rThen, turned to me: \xc3\x92By that especial grace\r    Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals\r    His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,\r\rWhen thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,\r    Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,\r    Where answer to the innocent is made.\r\rI do not think her mother loves me more,\r    Since she has laid aside her wimple white,\r    Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.\r\rThrough her full easily is comprehended\r    How long in woman lasts the fire of love,\r    If eye or touch do not relight it often.\r\rSo fair a hatchment will not make for her\r    The Viper marshalling the Milanese\r    A-field, as would have made Gallura\xc3\x95s Cock.\xc3\x93\r\rIn this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed\r    Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal\r    Which measurably burneth in the heart.\r\rMy greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,\r    Still to that point where slowest are the stars,\r    Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.\r\rAnd my Conductor: \xc3\x92Son, what dost thou gaze at\r    Up there?\xc3\x93  And I to him: \xc3\x92At those three torches\r    With which this hither pole is all on fire.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92The four resplendent stars\r    Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,\r    And these have mounted up to where those were.\xc3\x93\r\rAs he was speaking, to himself Sordello\r    Drew him, and said, \xc3\x92Lo there our Adversary!\xc3\x93\r    And pointed with his finger to look thither.\r\rUpon the side on which the little valley\r    No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance\r    The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.\r\r\xc3\x95Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,\r    Turning at times its head about, and licking\r    Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.\r\rI did not see, and therefore cannot say\r    How the celestial falcons \xc3\x95gan to move,\r    But well I saw that they were both in motion.\r\rHearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,\r    The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,\r    Up to their stations flying back alike.\r\rThe shade that to the Judge had near approached\r    When he had called, throughout that whole assault\r    Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.\r\r\xc3\x92So may the light that leadeth thee on high\r    Find in thine own free-will as much of wax\r    As needful is up to the highest azure,\xc3\x93\r\rBegan it, \xc3\x92if some true intelligence\r    Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood\r    Thou knowest, tell it me, who once was great there.\r\rCurrado Malaspina was I called;\r    I\xc3\x95m not the elder, but from him descended;\r    To mine I bore the love which here refineth.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O,\xc3\x93 said I unto him, \xc3\x92through your domains\r    I never passed, but where is there a dwelling\r    Throughout all Europe, where they are not known?\r\rThat fame, which doeth honour to your house,\r    Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,\r    So that he knows of them who ne\xc3\x95er was there.\r\rAnd, as I hope for heaven, I swear to you\r    Your honoured family in naught abates\r    The glory of the purse and of the sword.\r\rIt is so privileged by use and nature,\r    That though a guilty head misguide the world,\r    Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he: \xc3\x92Now go; for the sun shall not lie\r    Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram\r    With all his four feet covers and bestrides,\r\rBefore that such a courteous opinion\r    Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed\r    With greater nails than of another\xc3\x95s speech,\r\rUnless the course of justice standeth still.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto IX\r\r\rThe concubine of old Tithonus now\r    Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,\r    Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;\r\rWith gems her forehead all relucent was,\r    Set in the shape of that cold animal\r    Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,\r\rAnd of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night\r    Had taken two in that place where we were,\r    And now the third was bending down its wings;\r\rWhen I, who something had of Adam in me,\r    Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,\r    There were all five of us already sat.\r\rJust at the hour when her sad lay begins\r    The little swallow, near unto the morning,\r    Perchance in memory of her former woes,\r\rAnd when the mind of man, a wanderer\r    More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,\r    Almost prophetic in its visions is,\r\rIn dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended\r    An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,\r    With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,\r\rAnd this, it seemed to me, was where had been\r    By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,\r    When to the high consistory he was rapt.\r\rI thought within myself, perchance he strikes\r    From habit only here, and from elsewhere\r    Disdains to bear up any in his feet.\r\rThen wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,\r    Terrible as the lightning he descended,\r    And snatched me upward even to the fire.\r\rTherein it seemed that he and I were burning,\r    And the imagined fire did scorch me so,\r    That of necessity my sleep was broken.\r\rNot otherwise Achilles started up,\r    Around him turning his awakened eyes,\r    And knowing not the place in which he was,\r\rWhat time from Chiron stealthily his mother\r    Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,\r    Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,\r\rThan I upstarted, when from off my face\r    Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,\r    As doth the man who freezes with affright.\r\rOnly my Comforter was at my side,\r    And now the sun was more than two hours high,\r    And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.\r\r\xc3\x92Be not intimidated,\xc3\x93 said my Lord,\r    \xc3\x92Be reassured, for all is well with us;\r    Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.\r\rThou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;\r    See there the cliff that closes it around;\r    See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.\r\rWhilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,\r    When inwardly thy spirit was asleep\r    Upon the flowers that deck the land below,\r\rThere came a Lady and said: \xc3\x94I am Lucia;\r    Let me take this one up, who is asleep;\r    So will I make his journey easier for him.\xc3\x95\r\rSordello and the other noble shapes\r    Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,\r    Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.\r\rShe laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes\r    That open entrance pointed out to me;\r    Then she and sleep together went away.\xc3\x93\r\rIn guise of one whose doubts are reassured,\r    And who to confidence his fear doth change,\r    After the truth has been discovered to him,\r\rSo did I change; and when without disquiet\r    My Leader saw me, up along the cliff\r    He moved, and I behind him, tow\xc3\x95rd the height.\r\rReader, thou seest well how I exalt\r    My theme, and therefore if with greater art\r    I fortify it, marvel not thereat.\r\rNearer approached we, and were in such place,\r    That there, where first appeared to me a rift\r    Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,\r\rI saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,\r    Diverse in colour, to go up to it,\r    And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.\r\rAnd as I opened more and more mine eyes,\r    I saw him seated on the highest stair,\r    Such in the face that I endured it not.\r\rAnd in his hand he had a naked sword,\r    Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow\xc3\x95rds us,\r    That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.\r\r\xc3\x92Tell it from where you are, what is\xc3\x95t you wish?\xc3\x93\r    Began he to exclaim; \xc3\x92where is the escort?\r    Take heed your coming hither harm you not!\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,\xc3\x93\r    My Master answered him, \xc3\x92but even now\r    Said to us, \xc3\x94Thither go; there is the portal.\xc3\x95\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92And may she speed your footsteps in all good,\xc3\x93\r    Again began the courteous janitor;\r    \xc3\x92Come forward then unto these stairs of ours.\xc3\x93\r\rThither did we approach; and the first stair\r    Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,\r    I mirrored myself therein as I appear.\r\rThe second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,\r    Was of a calcined and uneven stone,\r    Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.\r\rThe third, that uppermost rests massively,\r    Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red\r    As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.\r\rBoth of his feet was holding upon this\r    The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,\r    Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.\r\rAlong the three stairs upward with good will\r    Did my Conductor draw me, saying: \xc3\x92Ask\r    Humbly that he the fastening may undo.\xc3\x93\r\rDevoutly at the holy feet I cast me,\r    For mercy\xc3\x95s sake besought that he would open,\r    But first upon my breast three times I smote.\r\rSeven P\xc3\x95s upon my forehead he described\r    With the sword\xc3\x95s point, and, \xc3\x92Take heed that thou wash\r    These wounds, when thou shalt be within,\xc3\x93 he said.\r\rAshes, or earth that dry is excavated,\r    Of the same colour were with his attire,\r    And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.\r\rOne was of gold, and the other was of silver;\r    First with the white, and after with the yellow,\r    Plied he the door, so that I was content.\r\r\xc3\x92Whenever faileth either of these keys\r    So that it turn not rightly in the lock,\xc3\x93\r    He said to us, \xc3\x92this entrance doth not open.\r\rMore precious one is, but the other needs\r    More art and intellect ere it unlock,\r    For it is that which doth the knot unloose.\r\rFrom Peter I have them; and he bade me err\r    Rather in opening than in keeping shut,\r    If people but fall down before my feet.\xc3\x93\r\rThen pushed the portals of the sacred door,\r    Exclaiming: \xc3\x92Enter; but I give you warning\r    That forth returns whoever looks behind.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd when upon their hinges were turned round\r    The swivels of that consecrated gate,\r    Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,\r\rRoared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed\r    Tarpeia, when was ta\xc3\x95en from it the good\r    Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.\r\rAt the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,\r    And \xc3\x92Te Deum laudamus\xc3\x93 seemed to hear\r    In voices mingled with sweet melody.\r\rExactly such an image rendered me\r    That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,\r    When people singing with the organ stand;\r\rFor now we hear, and now hear not, the words.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto X\r\r\rWhen we had crossed the threshold of the door\r    Which the perverted love of souls disuses,\r    Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,\r\rRe-echoing I heard it closed again;\r    And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,\r    What for my failing had been fit excuse?\r\rWe mounted upward through a rifted rock,\r    Which undulated to this side and that,\r    Even as a wave receding and advancing.\r\r\xc3\x92Here it behoves us use a little art,\xc3\x93\r    Began my Leader, \xc3\x92to adapt ourselves\r    Now here, now there, to the receding side.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd this our footsteps so infrequent made,\r    That sooner had the moon\xc3\x95s decreasing disk\r    Regained its bed to sink again to rest,\r\rThan we were forth from out that needle\xc3\x95s eye;\r    But when we free and in the open were,\r    There where the mountain backward piles itself,\r\rI wearied out, and both of us uncertain\r    About our way, we stopped upon a plain\r    More desolate than roads across the deserts.\r\rFrom where its margin borders on the void,\r    To foot of the high bank that ever rises,\r    A human body three times told would measure;\r\rAnd far as eye of mine could wing its flight,\r    Now on the left, and on the right flank now,\r    The same this cornice did appear to me.\r\rThereon our feet had not been moved as yet,\r    When I perceived the embankment round about,\r    Which all right of ascent had interdicted,\r\rTo be of marble white, and so adorned\r    With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,\r    But Nature\xc3\x95s self, had there been put to shame.\r\rThe Angel, who came down to earth with tidings\r    Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,\r    And opened Heaven from its long interdict,\r\rIn front of us appeared so truthfully\r    There sculptured in a gracious attitude,\r    He did not seem an image that is silent.\r\rOne would have sworn that he was saying, \xc3\x92Ave;\xc3\x93\r    For she was there in effigy portrayed\r    Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,\r\rAnd in her mien this language had impressed,\r    \xc3\x92Ecce ancilla Dei,\xc3\x93 as distinctly\r    As any figure stamps itself in wax.\r\r\xc3\x92Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,\xc3\x93\r    The gentle Master said, who had me standing\r    Upon that side where people have their hearts;\r\rWhereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld\r    In rear of Mary, and upon that side\r    Where he was standing who conducted me,\r\rAnother story on the rock imposed;\r    Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,\r    So that before mine eyes it might be set.\r\rThere sculptured in the self-same marble were\r    The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,\r    Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.\r\rPeople appeared in front, and all of them\r    In seven choirs divided, of two senses\r    Made one say \xc3\x92No,\xc3\x93 the other, \xc3\x92Yes, they sing.\xc3\x93\r\rLikewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,\r    Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose\r    Were in the yes and no discordant made.\r\rPreceded there the vessel benedight,\r    Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,\r    And more and less than King was he in this.\r\rOpposite, represented at the window\r    Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,\r    Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.\r\rI moved my feet from where I had been standing,\r    To examine near at hand another story,\r    Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.\r\rThere the high glory of the Roman Prince\r    Was chronicled, whose great beneficence\r    Moved Gregory to his great victory;\r\r\xc3\x95Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;\r    And a poor widow at his bridle stood,\r    In attitude of weeping and of grief.\r\rAround about him seemed it thronged and full\r    Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold\r    Above them visibly in the wind were moving.\r\rThe wretched woman in the midst of these\r    Seemed to be saying: \xc3\x92Give me vengeance, Lord,\r    For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to answer her: \xc3\x92Now wait until\r    I shall return.\xc3\x93  And she: \xc3\x92My Lord,\xc3\x93 like one\r    In whom grief is impatient, \xc3\x92shouldst thou not\r\rReturn?\xc3\x93  And he: \xc3\x92Who shall be where I am\r    Will give it thee.\xc3\x93  And she: \xc3\x92Good deed of others\r    What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?\xc3\x93\r\rWhence he: \xc3\x92Now comfort thee, for it behoves me\r    That I discharge my duty ere I move;\r    Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me.\xc3\x93\r\rHe who on no new thing has ever looked\r    Was the creator of this visible language,\r    Novel to us, for here it is not found.\r\rWhile I delighted me in contemplating\r    The images of such humility,\r    And dear to look on for their Maker\xc3\x95s sake,\r\r\xc3\x92Behold, upon this side, but rare they make\r    Their steps,\xc3\x93 the Poet murmured, \xc3\x92many people;\r    These will direct us to the lofty stairs.\xc3\x93\r\rMine eyes, that in beholding were intent\r    To see new things, of which they curious are,\r    In turning round towards him were not slow.\r\rBut still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve\r    From thy good purposes, because thou hearest\r    How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;\r\rAttend not to the fashion of the torment,\r    Think of what follows; think that at the worst\r    It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.\r\r\xc3\x92Master,\xc3\x93 began I, \xc3\x92that which I behold\r    Moving towards us seems to me not persons,\r    And what I know not, so in sight I waver.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92The grievous quality\r    Of this their torment bows them so to earth,\r    That my own eyes at first contended with it;\r\rBut look there fixedly, and disentangle\r    By sight what cometh underneath those stones;\r    Already canst thou see how each is stricken.\xc3\x93\r\rO ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!\r    Who, in the vision of the mind infirm\r    Confidence have in your backsliding steps,\r\rDo ye not comprehend that we are worms,\r    Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly\r    That flieth unto judgment without screen?\r\rWhy floats aloft your spirit high in air?\r    Like are ye unto insects undeveloped,\r    Even as the worm in whom formation fails!\r\rAs to sustain a ceiling or a roof,\r    In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure\r    Is seen to join its knees unto its breast,\r\rWhich makes of the unreal real anguish\r    Arise in him who sees it, fashioned thus\r    Beheld I those, when I had ta\xc3\x95en good heed.\r\rTrue is it, they were more or less bent down,\r    According as they more or less were laden;\r    And he who had most patience in his looks\r\rWeeping did seem to say, \xc3\x92I can no more!\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XI\r\r\r\xc3\x92Our Father, thou who dwellest in the heavens,\r    Not circumscribed, but from the greater love\r    Thou bearest to the first effects on high,\r\rPraised be thy name and thine omnipotence\r    By every creature, as befitting is\r    To render thanks to thy sweet effluence.\r\rCome unto us the peace of thy dominion,\r    For unto it we cannot of ourselves,\r    If it come not, with all our intellect.\r\rEven as thine own Angels of their will\r    Make sacrifice to thee, Hosanna singing,\r    So may all men make sacrifice of theirs.\r\rGive unto us this day our daily manna,\r    Withouten which in this rough wilderness\r    Backward goes he who toils most to advance.\r\rAnd even as we the trespass we have suffered\r    Pardon in one another, pardon thou\r    Benignly, and regard not our desert.\r\rOur virtue, which is easily o\xc3\x95ercome,\r    Put not to proof with the old Adversary,\r    But thou from him who spurs it so, deliver.\r\rThis last petition verily, dear Lord,\r    Not for ourselves is made, who need it not,\r    But for their sake who have remained behind us.\xc3\x93\r\rThus for themselves and us good furtherance\r    Those shades imploring, went beneath a weight\r    Like unto that of which we sometimes dream,\r\rUnequally in anguish round and round\r    And weary all, upon that foremost cornice,\r    Purging away the smoke-stains of the world.\r\rIf there good words are always said for us,\r    What may not here be said and done for them,\r    By those who have a good root to their will?\r\rWell may we help them wash away the marks\r    That hence they carried, so that clean and light\r    They may ascend unto the starry wheels!\r\r\xc3\x92Ah! so may pity and justice you disburden\r    Soon, that ye may have power to move the wing,\r    That shall uplift you after your desire,\r\rShow us on which hand tow\xc3\x95rd the stairs the way\r    Is shortest, and if more than one the passes,\r    Point us out that which least abruptly falls;\r\rFor he who cometh with me, through the burden\r    Of Adam\xc3\x95s flesh wherewith he is invested,\r    Against his will is chary of his climbing.\xc3\x93\r\rThe words of theirs which they returned to those\r    That he whom I was following had spoken,\r    It was not manifest from whom they came,\r\rBut it was said: \xc3\x92To the right hand come with us\r    Along the bank, and ye shall find a pass\r    Possible for living person to ascend.\r\rAnd were I not impeded by the stone,\r    Which this proud neck of mine doth subjugate,\r    Whence I am forced to hold my visage down,\r\rHim, who still lives and does not name himself,\r    Would I regard, to see if I may know him\r    And make him piteous unto this burden.\r\rA Latian was I, and born of a great Tuscan;\r    Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father;\r    I know not if his name were ever with you.\r\rThe ancient blood and deeds of gallantry\r    Of my progenitors so arrogant made me\r    That, thinking not upon the common mother,\r\rAll men I held in scorn to such extent\r    I died therefor, as know the Sienese,\r    And every child in Campagnatico.\r\rI am Omberto; and not to me alone\r    Has pride done harm, but all my kith and kin\r    Has with it dragged into adversity.\r\rAnd here must I this burden bear for it\r    Till God be satisfied, since I did not\r    Among the living, here among the dead.\xc3\x93\r\rListening I downward bent my countenance;\r    And one of them, not this one who was speaking,\r    Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him,\r\rAnd looked at me, and knew me, and called out,\r    Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed\r    On me, who all bowed down was going with them.\r\r\xc3\x92O,\xc3\x93 asked I him, \xc3\x92art thou not Oderisi,\r    Agobbio\xc3\x95s honour, and honour of that art\r    Which is in Paris called illuminating?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Brother,\xc3\x93 said he, \xc3\x92more laughing are the leaves\r    Touched by the brush of Franco Bolognese;\r    All his the honour now, and mine in part.\r\rIn sooth I had not been so courteous\r    While I was living, for the great desire\r    Of excellence, on which my heart was bent.\r\rHere of such pride is paid the forfeiture;\r    And yet I should not be here, were it not\r    That, having power to sin, I turned to God.\r\rO thou vain glory of the human powers,\r    How little green upon thy summit lingers,\r    If\xc3\x95t be not followed by an age of grossness!\r\rIn painting Cimabue thought that he\r    Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry,\r    So that the other\xc3\x95s fame is growing dim.\r\rSo has one Guido from the other taken\r    The glory of our tongue, and he perchance\r    Is born, who from the nest shall chase them both.\r\rNaught is this mundane rumour but a breath\r    Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,\r    And changes name, because it changes side.\r\rWhat fame shalt thou have more, if old peel off\r    From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead\r    Before thou left the \xc3\x94pappo\xc3\x95 and the \xc3\x94dindi,\xc3\x95\r\rEre pass a thousand years? which is a shorter\r    Space to the eterne, than twinkling of an eye\r    Unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest.\r\rWith him, who takes so little of the road\r    In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;\r    And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,\r\rWhere he was lord, what time was overthrown\r    The Florentine delirium, that superb\r    Was at that day as now \xc3\x95tis prostitute.\r\rYour reputation is the colour of grass\r    Which comes and goes, and that discolours it\r    By which it issues green from out the earth.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92Thy true speech fills my heart with good\r    Humility, and great tumour thou assuagest;\r    But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92That,\xc3\x93 he replied, \xc3\x92is Provenzan Salvani,\r    And he is here because he had presumed\r    To bring Siena all into his hands.\r\rHe has gone thus, and goeth without rest\r    E\xc3\x95er since he died; such money renders back\r    In payment he who is on earth too daring.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92If every spirit who awaits\r    The verge of life before that he repent,\r    Remains below there and ascends not hither,\r\r(Unless good orison shall him bestead,)\r    Until as much time as he lived be passed,\r    How was the coming granted him in largess?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92When he in greatest splendour lived,\xc3\x93 said he,\r    \xc3\x92Freely upon the Campo of Siena,\r    All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;\r\rAnd there to draw his friend from the duress\r    Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,\r    He brought himself to tremble in each vein.\r\rI say no more, and know that I speak darkly;\r    Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours\r    Will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it.\r\rThis action has released him from those confines.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XII\r\r\rAbreast, like oxen going in a yoke,\r    I with that heavy-laden soul went on,\r    As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted;\r\rBut when he said, \xc3\x92Leave him, and onward pass,\r    For here \xc3\x95tis good that with the sail and oars,\r    As much as may be, each push on his barque;\xc3\x93\r\rUpright, as walking wills it, I redressed\r    My person, notwithstanding that my thoughts\r    Remained within me downcast and abashed.\r\rI had moved on, and followed willingly\r    The footsteps of my Master, and we both\r    Already showed how light of foot we were,\r\rWhen unto me he said: \xc3\x92Cast down thine eyes;\r    \xc3\x95Twere well for thee, to alleviate the way,\r    To look upon the bed beneath thy feet.\xc3\x93\r\rAs, that some memory may exist of them,\r    Above the buried dead their tombs in earth\r    Bear sculptured on them what they were before;\r\rWhence often there we weep for them afresh,\r    From pricking of remembrance, which alone\r    To the compassionate doth set its spur;\r\rSo saw I there, but of a better semblance\r    In point of artifice, with figures covered\r    Whate\xc3\x95er as pathway from the mount projects.\r\rI saw that one who was created noble\r    More than all other creatures, down from heaven\r    Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side.\r\rI saw Briareus smitten by the dart\r    Celestial, lying on the other side,\r    Heavy upon the earth by mortal frost.\r\rI saw Thymbraeus, Pallas saw, and Mars,\r    Still clad in armour round about their father,\r    Gaze at the scattered members of the giants.\r\rI saw, at foot of his great labour, Nimrod,\r    As if bewildered, looking at the people\r    Who had been proud with him in Sennaar.\r\rO Niobe! with what afflicted eyes\r    Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced,\r    Between thy seven and seven children slain!\r\rO Saul! how fallen upon thy proper sword\r    Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa,\r    That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!\r\rO mad Arachne! so I thee beheld\r    E\xc3\x95en then half spider, sad upon the shreds\r    Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee!\r\rO Rehoboam! no more seems to threaten\r    Thine image there; but full of consternation\r    A chariot bears it off, when none pursues!\r\rDisplayed moreo\xc3\x95er the adamantine pavement\r    How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon\r    Costly appear the luckless ornament;\r\rDisplayed how his own sons did throw themselves\r    Upon Sennacherib within the temple,\r    And how, he being dead, they left him there;\r\rDisplayed the ruin and the cruel carnage\r    That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,\r    \xc3\x92Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!\xc3\x93\r\rDisplayed how routed fled the Assyrians\r    After that Holofernes had been slain,\r    And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.\r\rI saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns;\r    O Ilion! thee, how abject and debased,\r    Displayed the image that is there discerned!\r\rWhoe\xc3\x95er of pencil master was or stile,\r    That could portray the shades and traits which there\r    Would cause each subtile genius to admire?\r\rDead seemed the dead, the living seemed alive;\r    Better than I saw not who saw the truth,\r    All that I trod upon while bowed I went.\r\rNow wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted,\r    Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your faces\r    So that ye may behold your evil ways!\r\rMore of the mount by us was now encompassed,\r    And far more spent the circuit of the sun,\r    Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,\r\rWhen he, who ever watchful in advance\r    Was going on, began: \xc3\x92Lift up thy head,\r    \xc3\x95Tis no more time to go thus meditating.\r\rLo there an Angel who is making haste\r    To come towards us; lo, returning is\r    From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.\r\rWith reverence thine acts and looks adorn,\r    So that he may delight to speed us upward;\r    Think that this day will never dawn again.\xc3\x93\r\rI was familiar with his admonition\r    Ever to lose no time; so on this theme\r    He could not unto me speak covertly.\r\rTowards us came the being beautiful\r    Vested in white, and in his countenance\r    Such as appears the tremulous morning star.\r\rHis arms he opened, and opened then his wings;\r    \xc3\x92Come,\xc3\x93 said he, \xc3\x92near at hand here are the steps,\r    And easy from henceforth is the ascent.\xc3\x93\r\rAt this announcement few are they who come!\r    O human creatures, born to soar aloft,\r    Why fall ye thus before a little wind?\r\rHe led us on to where the rock was cleft;\r    There smote upon my forehead with his wings,\r    Then a safe passage promised unto me.\r\rAs on the right hand, to ascend the mount\r    Where seated is the church that lordeth it\r    O\xc3\x95er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,\r\rThe bold abruptness of the ascent is broken\r    By stairways that were made there in the age\r    When still were safe the ledger and the stave,\r\rE\xc3\x95en thus attempered is the bank which falls\r    Sheer downward from the second circle there;\r    But on this, side and that the high rock graze.\r\rAs we were turning thitherward our persons,\r    \xc3\x92Beati pauperes spiritu,\xc3\x93 voices\r    Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.\r\rAh me! how different are these entrances\r    From the Infernal! for with anthems here\r    One enters, and below with wild laments.\r\rWe now were hunting up the sacred stairs,\r    And it appeared to me by far more easy\r    Than on the plain it had appeared before.\r\rWhence I: \xc3\x92My Master, say, what heavy thing\r    Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly\r    Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?\xc3\x93\r\rHe answered: \xc3\x92When the P\xc3\x95s which have remained\r    Still on thy face almost obliterate\r    Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,\r\rThy feet will be so vanquished by good will,\r    That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,\r    But urging up will be to them delight.\xc3\x93\r\rThen did I even as they do who are going\r    With something on the head to them unknown,\r    Unless the signs of others make them doubt,\r\rWherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,\r    And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office\r    Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;\r\rAnd with the fingers of the right hand spread\r    I found but six the letters, that had carved\r    Upon my temples he who bore the keys;\r\rUpon beholding which my Leader smiled.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XIII\r\r\rWe were upon the summit of the stairs,\r    Where for the second time is cut away\r    The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.\r\rThere in like manner doth a cornice bind\r    The hill all round about, as does the first,\r    Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.\r\rShade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;\r    So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,\r    With but the livid colour of the stone.\r\r\xc3\x92If to inquire we wait for people here,\xc3\x93\r    The Poet said, \xc3\x92I fear that peradventure\r    Too much delay will our election have.\xc3\x93\r\rThen steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,\r    Made his right side the centre of his motion,\r    And turned the left part of himself about.\r\r\xc3\x92O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter\r    Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,\xc3\x93\r    Said he, \xc3\x92as one within here should be led.\r\rThou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;\r    If other reason prompt not otherwise,\r    Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!\xc3\x93\r\rAs much as here is counted for a mile,\r    So much already there had we advanced\r    In little time, by dint of ready will;\r\rAnd tow\xc3\x95rds us there were heard to fly, albeit\r    They were not visible, spirits uttering\r    Unto Love\xc3\x95s table courteous invitations,\r\rThe first voice that passed onward in its flight,\r    \xc3\x92Vinum non habent,\xc3\x93 said in accents loud,\r    And went reiterating it behind us.\r\rAnd ere it wholly grew inaudible\r    Because of distance, passed another, crying,\r    \xc3\x92I am Orestes!\xc3\x93 and it also stayed not.\r\r\xc3\x92O,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92Father, these, what voices are they?\xc3\x93\r    And even as I asked, behold the third,\r    Saying: \xc3\x92Love those from whom ye have had evil!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd the good Master said: \xc3\x92This circle scourges\r    The sin of envy, and on that account\r    Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.\r\rThe bridle of another sound shall be;\r    I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,\r    Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.\r\rBut fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,\r    And people thou wilt see before us sitting,\r    And each one close against the cliff is seated.\xc3\x93\r\rThen wider than at first mine eyes I opened;\r    I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles\r    Not from the colour of the stone diverse.\r\rAnd when we were a little farther onward,\r    I heard a cry of, \xc3\x92Mary, pray for us!\xc3\x93\r    A cry of, \xc3\x92Michael, Peter, and all Saints!\xc3\x93\r\rI do not think there walketh still on earth\r    A man so hard, that he would not be pierced\r    With pity at what afterward I saw.\r\rFor when I had approached so near to them\r    That manifest to me their acts became,\r    Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.\r\rCovered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,\r    And one sustained the other with his shoulder,\r    And all of them were by the bank sustained.\r\rThus do the blind, in want of livelihood,\r    Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,\r    And one upon another leans his head,\r\rSo that in others pity soon may rise,\r    Not only at the accent of their words,\r    But at their aspect, which no less implores.\r\rAnd as unto the blind the sun comes not,\r    So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,\r    Heaven\xc3\x95s light will not be bounteous of itself;\r\rFor all their lids an iron wire transpierces,\r    And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild\r    Is done, because it will not quiet stay.\r\rTo me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,\r    Seeing the others without being seen;\r    Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.\r\rWell knew he what the mute one wished to say,\r    And therefore waited not for my demand,\r    But said: \xc3\x92Speak, and be brief, and to the point.\xc3\x93\r\rI had Virgilius upon that side\r    Of the embankment from which one may fall,\r    Since by no border \xc3\x95tis engarlanded;\r\rUpon the other side of me I had\r    The shades devout, who through the horrible seam\r    Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.\r\rTo them I turned me, and, \xc3\x92O people, certain,\xc3\x93\r    Began I, \xc3\x92of beholding the high light,\r    Which your desire has solely in its care,\r\rSo may grace speedily dissolve the scum\r    Upon your consciences, that limpidly\r    Through them descend the river of the mind,\r\rTell me, for dear \xc3\x95twill be to me and gracious,\r    If any soul among you here is Latian,\r    And \xc3\x95twill perchance be good for him I learn it.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O brother mine, each one is citizen\r    Of one true city; but thy meaning is,\r    Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim.\xc3\x93\r\rBy way of answer this I seemed to hear\r    A little farther on than where I stood,\r    Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.\r\rAmong the rest I saw a shade that waited\r    In aspect, and should any one ask how,\r    Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.\r\r\xc3\x92Spirit,\xc3\x93 I said, \xc3\x92who stoopest to ascend,\r    If thou art he who did reply to me,\r    Make thyself known to me by place or name.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Sienese was I,\xc3\x93 it replied, \xc3\x92and with\r    The others here recleanse my guilty life,\r    Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.\r\rSapient I was not, although I Sapia\r    Was called, and I was at another\xc3\x95s harm\r    More happy far than at my own good fortune.\r\rAnd that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,\r    Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.\r    The arc already of my years descending,\r\rMy fellow-citizens near unto Colle\r    Were joined in battle with their adversaries,\r    And I was praying God for what he willed.\r\rRouted were they, and turned into the bitter\r    Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,\r    A joy received unequalled by all others;\r\rSo that I lifted upward my bold face\r    Crying to God, \xc3\x94Henceforth I fear thee not,\xc3\x95\r    As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.\r\rPeace I desired with God at the extreme\r    Of my existence, and as yet would not\r    My debt have been by penitence discharged,\r\rHad it not been that in remembrance held me\r    Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,\r    Who out of charity was grieved for me.\r\rBut who art thou, that into our conditions\r    Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound\r    As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Mine eyes,\xc3\x93 I said, \xc3\x92will yet be here ta\xc3\x95en from me,\r    But for short space; for small is the offence\r    Committed by their being turned with envy.\r\rFar greater is the fear, wherein suspended\r    My soul is, of the torment underneath,\r    For even now the load down there weighs on me.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd she to me: \xc3\x92Who led thee, then, among us\r    Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?\xc3\x93\r    And I: \xc3\x92He who is with me, and speaks not;\r\rAnd living am I; therefore ask of me,\r    Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move\r    O\xc3\x95er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O, this is such a novel thing to hear,\xc3\x93\r    She answered, \xc3\x92that great sign it is God loves thee;\r    Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.\r\rAnd I implore, by what thou most desirest,\r    If e\xc3\x95er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,\r    Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.\r\rThem wilt thou see among that people vain\r    Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there\r    More hope than in discovering the Diana;\r\rBut there still more the admirals will lose.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XIV\r\r\r\xc3\x92Who is this one that goes about our mountain,\r    Or ever Death has given him power of flight,\r    And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92I know not who, but know he\xc3\x95s not alone;\r    Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,\r    And gently, so that he may speak, accost him.\xc3\x93\r\rThus did two spirits, leaning tow\xc3\x95rds each other,\r    Discourse about me there on the right hand;\r    Then held supine their faces to address me.\r\rAnd said the one: \xc3\x92O soul, that, fastened still\r    Within the body, tow\xc3\x95rds the heaven art going,\r    For charity console us, and declare\r\rWhence comest and who art thou; for thou mak\xc3\x95st us\r    As much to marvel at this grace of thine\r    As must a thing that never yet has been.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92Through midst of Tuscany there wanders\r    A streamlet that is born in Falterona,\r    And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;\r\rFrom thereupon do I this body bring.\r    To tell you who I am were speech in vain,\r    Because my name as yet makes no great noise.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92If well thy meaning I can penetrate\r    With intellect of mine,\xc3\x93 then answered me\r    He who first spake, \xc3\x92thou speakest of the Arno.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd said the other to him: \xc3\x92Why concealed\r    This one the appellation of that river,\r    Even as a man doth of things horrible?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd thus the shade that questioned was of this\r    Himself acquitted: \xc3\x92I know not; but truly\r    \xc3\x95Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;\r\rFor from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant\r    The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro\r    That in few places it that mark surpasses)\r\rTo where it yields itself in restoration\r    Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,\r    Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,\r\rVirtue is like an enemy avoided\r    By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune\r    Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;\r\rOn which account have so transformed their nature\r    The dwellers in that miserable valley,\r    It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.\r\r\xc3\x95Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier\r    Than other food for human use created,\r    It first directeth its impoverished way.\r\rCurs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,\r    More snarling than their puissance demands,\r    And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.\r\rIt goes on falling, and the more it grows,\r    The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,\r    This maledict and misadventurous ditch.\r\rDescended then through many a hollow gulf,\r    It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,\r    They fear no cunning that may master them.\r\rNor will I cease because another hears me;\r    And well \xc3\x95twill be for him, if still he mind him\r    Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.\r\rThy grandson I behold, who doth become\r    A hunter of those wolves upon the bank\r    Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.\r\rHe sells their flesh, it being yet alive;\r    Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;\r    Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.\r\rBlood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;\r    He leaves it such, a thousand years from now\r    In its primeval state \xc3\x95tis not re-wooded.\xc3\x93\r\rAs at the announcement of impending ills\r    The face of him who listens is disturbed,\r    From whate\xc3\x95er side the peril seize upon him;\r\rSo I beheld that other soul, which stood\r    Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,\r    When it had gathered to itself the word.\r\rThe speech of one and aspect of the other\r    Had me desirous made to know their names,\r    And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,\r\rWhereat the spirit which first spake to me\r    Began again: \xc3\x92Thou wishest I should bring me\r    To do for thee what thou\xc3\x95lt not do for me;\r\rBut since God willeth that in thee shine forth\r    Such grace of his, I\xc3\x95ll not be chary with thee;\r    Know, then, that I Guido del Duca am.\r\rMy blood was so with envy set on fire,\r    That if I had beheld a man make merry,\r    Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o\xc3\x95er with pallor.\r\rFrom my own sowing such the straw I reap!\r    O human race! why dost thou set thy heart\r    Where interdict of partnership must be?\r\rThis is Renier; this is the boast and honour\r    Of the house of Calboli, where no one since\r    Has made himself the heir of his desert.\r\rAnd not alone his blood is made devoid,\r    \xc3\x95Twixt Po and mount, and sea-shore and the Reno,\r    Of good required for truth and for diversion;\r\rFor all within these boundaries is full\r    Of venomous roots, so that too tardily\r    By cultivation now would they diminish.\r\rWhere is good Lizio, and Arrigo Manardi,\r    Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna,\r    O Romagnuoli into bastards turned?\r\rWhen in Bologna will a Fabbro rise?\r    When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco,\r    The noble scion of ignoble seed?\r\rBe not astonished, Tuscan, if I weep,\r    When I remember, with Guido da Prata,\r    Ugolin d\xc3\x95 Azzo, who was living with us,\r\rFrederick Tignoso and his company,\r    The house of Traversara, and th\xc3\x95 Anastagi,\r    And one race and the other is extinct;\r\rThe dames and cavaliers, the toils and ease\r    That filled our souls with love and courtesy,\r    There where the hearts have so malicious grown!\r\rO Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee,\r    Seeing that all thy family is gone,\r    And many people, not to be corrupted?\r\rBagnacaval does well in not begetting\r    And ill does Castrocaro, and Conio worse,\r    In taking trouble to beget such Counts.\r\rWill do well the Pagani, when their Devil\r    Shall have departed; but not therefore pure\r    Will testimony of them e\xc3\x95er remain.\r\rO Ugolin de\xc3\x95 Fantoli, secure\r    Thy name is, since no longer is awaited\r    One who, degenerating, can obscure it!\r\rBut go now, Tuscan, for it now delights me\r    To weep far better than it does to speak,\r    So much has our discourse my mind distressed.\xc3\x93\r\rWe were aware that those beloved souls\r    Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent,\r    They made us of our pathway confident.\r\rWhen we became alone by going onward,\r    Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared\r    A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming:\r\r\xc3\x92Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!\xc3\x93\r    And fled as the reverberation dies\r    If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.\r\rAs soon as hearing had a truce from this,\r    Behold another, with so great a crash,\r    That it resembled thunderings following fast:\r\r\xc3\x92I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!\xc3\x93\r    And then, to press myself close to the Poet,\r    I backward, and not forward, took a step.\r\rAlready on all sides the air was quiet;\r    And said he to me: \xc3\x92That was the hard curb\r    That ought to hold a man within his bounds;\r\rBut you take in the bait so that the hook\r    Of the old Adversary draws you to him,\r    And hence availeth little curb or call.\r\rThe heavens are calling you, and wheel around you,\r    Displaying to you their eternal beauties,\r    And still your eye is looking on the ground;\r\rWhence He, who all discerns, chastises you.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XV\r\r\rAs much as \xc3\x95twixt the close of the third hour\r    And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere\r    Which aye in fashion of a child is playing,\r\rSo much it now appeared, towards the night,\r    Was of his course remaining to the sun;\r    There it was evening, and \xc3\x95twas midnight here;\r\rAnd the rays smote the middle of our faces,\r    Because by us the mount was so encircled,\r    That straight towards the west we now were going\r\rWhen I perceived my forehead overpowered\r    Beneath the splendour far more than at first,\r    And stupor were to me the things unknown,\r\rWhereat towards the summit of my brow\r    I raised my hands, and made myself the visor\r    Which the excessive glare diminishes.\r\rAs when from off the water, or a mirror,\r    The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,\r    Ascending upward in the selfsame measure\r\rThat it descends, and deviates as far\r    From falling of a stone in line direct,\r    (As demonstrate experiment and art,)\r\rSo it appeared to me that by a light\r    Refracted there before me I was smitten;\r    On which account my sight was swift to flee.\r\r\xc3\x92What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot\r    So fully screen my sight that it avail me,\xc3\x93\r    Said I, \xc3\x92and seems towards us to be moving?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet\r    The family of heaven,\xc3\x93 he answered me;\r    \xc3\x92An angel \xc3\x95tis, who comes to invite us upward.\r\rSoon will it be, that to behold these things\r    Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee\r    As much as nature fashioned thee to feel.\xc3\x93\r\rWhen we had reached the Angel benedight,\r    With joyful voice he said: \xc3\x92Here enter in\r    To stairway far less steep than are the others.\xc3\x93\r\rWe mounting were, already thence departed,\r    And \xc3\x92Beati misericordes\xc3\x93 was\r    Behind us sung, \xc3\x92Rejoice, thou that o\xc3\x95ercomest!\xc3\x93\r\rMy Master and myself, we two alone\r    Were going upward, and I thought, in going,\r    Some profit to acquire from words of his;\r\rAnd I to him directed me, thus asking:\r    \xc3\x92What did the spirit of Romagna mean,\r    Mentioning interdict and partnership?\xc3\x93\r\rWhence he to me: \xc3\x92Of his own greatest failing\r    He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not\r    If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.\r\rBecause are thither pointed your desires\r    Where by companionship each share is lessened,\r    Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.\r\rBut if the love of the supernal sphere\r    Should upwardly direct your aspiration,\r    There would not be that fear within your breast;\r\rFor there, as much the more as one says \xc3\x94Our,\xc3\x95\r    So much the more of good each one possesses,\r    And more of charity in that cloister burns.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92I am more hungering to be satisfied,\xc3\x93\r    I said, \xc3\x92than if I had before been silent,\r    And more of doubt within my mind I gather.\r\rHow can it be, that boon distributed\r    The more possessors can more wealthy make\r    Therein, than if by few it be possessed?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Because thou fixest still\r    Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,\r    Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.\r\rThat goodness infinite and ineffable\r    Which is above there, runneth unto love,\r    As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.\r\rSo much it gives itself as it finds ardour,\r    So that as far as charity extends,\r    O\xc3\x95er it increases the eternal valour.\r\rAnd the more people thitherward aspire,\r    More are there to love well, and more they love there,\r    And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.\r\rAnd if my reasoning appease thee not,\r    Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully\r    Take from thee this and every other longing.\r\rEndeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,\r    As are the two already, the five wounds\r    That close themselves again by being painful.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as I wished to say, \xc3\x92Thou dost appease me,\xc3\x93\r    I saw that I had reached another circle,\r    So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.\r\rThere it appeared to me that in a vision\r    Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,\r    And in a temple many persons saw;\r\rAnd at the door a woman, with the sweet\r    Behaviour of a mother, saying: \xc3\x92Son,\r    Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?\r\rLo, sorrowing, thy father and myself\r    Were seeking for thee;\xc3\x93\xc3\x91and as here she ceased,\r    That which appeared at first had disappeared.\r\rThen I beheld another with those waters\r    Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever\r    From great disdain of others it is born,\r\rAnd saying: \xc3\x92If of that city thou art lord,\r    For whose name was such strife among the gods,\r    And whence doth every science scintillate,\r\rAvenge thyself on those audacious arms\r    That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;\xc3\x93\r    And the lord seemed to me benign and mild\r\rTo answer her with aspect temperate:\r    \xc3\x92What shall we do to those who wish us ill,\r    If he who loves us be by us condemned?\xc3\x93\r\rThen saw I people hot in fire of wrath,\r    With stones a young man slaying, clamorously\r    Still crying to each other, \xc3\x92Kill him! kill him!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd him I saw bow down, because of death\r    That weighed already on him, to the earth,\r    But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,\r\rImploring the high Lord, in so great strife,\r    That he would pardon those his persecutors,\r    With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.\r\rSoon as my soul had outwardly returned\r    To things external to it which are true,\r    Did I my not false errors recognize.\r\rMy Leader, who could see me bear myself\r    Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,\r    Exclaimed: \xc3\x92What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?\r\rBut hast been coming more than half a league\r    Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,\r    In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,\r    I\xc3\x95ll tell thee,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92what appeared to me,\r    When thus from me my legs were ta\xc3\x95en away.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he: \xc3\x92If thou shouldst have a hundred masks\r    Upon thy face, from me would not be shut\r    Thy cogitations, howsoever small.\r\rWhat thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail\r    To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,\r    Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.\r\rI did not ask, \xc3\x94What ails thee?\xc3\x95 as he does\r    Who only looketh with the eyes that see not\r    When of the soul bereft the body lies,\r\rBut asked it to give vigour to thy feet;\r    Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow\r    To use their wakefulness when it returns.\xc3\x93\r\rWe passed along, athwart the twilight peering\r    Forward as far as ever eye could stretch\r    Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;\r\rAnd lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached\r    In our direction, sombre as the night,\r    Nor was there place to hide one\xc3\x95s self therefrom.\r\rThis of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XVI\r\r\rDarkness of hell, and of a night deprived\r    Of every planet under a poor sky,\r    As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,\r\rNe\xc3\x95er made unto my sight so thick a veil,\r    As did that smoke which there enveloped us,\r    Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;\r\rFor not an eye it suffered to stay open;\r    Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,\r    Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.\r\rE\xc3\x95en as a blind man goes behind his guide,\r    Lest he should wander, or should strike against\r    Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,\r\rSo went I through the bitter and foul air,\r    Listening unto my Leader, who said only,\r    \xc3\x92Look that from me thou be not separated.\xc3\x93\r\rVoices I heard, and every one appeared\r    To supplicate for peace and misericord\r    The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.\r\rStill \xc3\x92Agnus Dei\xc3\x93 their exordium was;\r    One word there was in all, and metre one,\r    So that all harmony appeared among them.\r\r\xc3\x92Master,\xc3\x93 I said, \xc3\x92are spirits those I hear?\xc3\x93\r    And he to me: \xc3\x92Thou apprehendest truly,\r    And they the knot of anger go unloosing.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke\r    And art discoursing of us even as though\r    Thou didst by calends still divide the time?\xc3\x93\r\rAfter this manner by a voice was spoken;\r    Whereon my Master said: \xc3\x92Do thou reply,\r    And ask if on this side the way go upward.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92O creature that dost cleanse thyself\r    To return beautiful to Him who made thee,\r    Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,\xc3\x93\r    He answered; \xc3\x92and if smoke prevent our seeing,\r    Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof.\xc3\x93\r\rThereon began I: \xc3\x92With that swathing band\r    Which death unwindeth am I going upward,\r    And hither came I through the infernal anguish.\r\rAnd if God in his grace has me infolded,\r    So that he wills that I behold his court\r    By method wholly out of modern usage,\r\rConceal not from me who ere death thou wast,\r    But tell it me, and tell me if I go\r    Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;\r    The world I knew, and loved that excellence,\r    At which has each one now unbent his bow.\r\rFor mounting upward, thou art going right.\xc3\x93\r    Thus he made answer, and subjoined: \xc3\x92I pray thee\r    To pray for me when thou shalt be above.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92My faith I pledge to thee\r    To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting\r    Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.\r\rFirst it was simple, and is now made double\r    By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,\r    Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.\r\rThe world forsooth is utterly deserted\r    By every virtue, as thou tellest me,\r    And with iniquity is big and covered;\r\rBut I beseech thee point me out the cause,\r    That I may see it, and to others show it;\r    For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it.\xc3\x93\r\rA sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!\r    He first sent forth, and then began he: \xc3\x92Brother,\r    The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!\r\rYe who are living every cause refer\r    Still upward to the heavens, as if all things\r    They of necessity moved with themselves.\r\rIf this were so, in you would be destroyed\r    Free will, nor any justice would there be\r    In having joy for good, or grief for evil.\r\rThe heavens your movements do initiate,\r    I say not all; but granting that I say it,\r    Light has been given you for good and evil,\r\rAnd free volition; which, if some fatigue\r    In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,\r    Afterwards conquers all, if well \xc3\x95tis nurtured.\r\rTo greater force and to a better nature,\r    Though free, ye subject are, and that creates\r    The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.\r\rHence, if the present world doth go astray,\r    In you the cause is, be it sought in you;\r    And I therein will now be thy true spy.\r\rForth from the hand of Him, who fondles it\r    Before it is, like to a little girl\r    Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,\r\rIssues the simple soul, that nothing knows,\r    Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,\r    Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.\r\rOf trivial good at first it tastes the savour;\r    Is cheated by it, and runs after it,\r    If guide or rein turn not aside its love.\r\rHence it behoved laws for a rein to place,\r    Behoved a king to have, who at the least\r    Of the true city should discern the tower.\r\rThe laws exist, but who sets hand to them?\r    No one; because the shepherd who precedes\r    Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;\r\rWherefore the people that perceives its guide\r    Strike only at the good for which it hankers,\r    Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.\r\rClearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance\r    The cause is that has made the world depraved,\r    And not that nature is corrupt in you.\r\rRome, that reformed the world, accustomed was\r    Two suns to have, which one road and the other,\r    Of God and of the world, made manifest.\r\rOne has the other quenched, and to the crosier\r    The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it\r    That by main force one with the other go,\r\rBecause, being joined, one feareth not the other;\r    If thou believe not, think upon the grain,\r    For by its seed each herb is recognized.\r\rIn the land laved by Po and Adige,\r    Valour and courtesy used to be found,\r    Before that Frederick had his controversy;\r\rNow in security can pass that way\r    Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,\r    From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.\r\rTrue, three old men are left, in whom upbraids\r    The ancient age the new, and late they deem it\r    That God restore them to the better life:\r\rCurrado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,\r    And Guido da Castel, who better named is,\r    In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:\r\rSay thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,\r    Confounding in itself two governments,\r    Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O Marco mine,\xc3\x93 I said, \xc3\x92thou reasonest well;\r    And now discern I why the sons of Levi\r    Have been excluded from the heritage.\r\rBut what Gherardo is it, who, as sample\r    Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained\r    In reprobation of the barbarous age?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,\xc3\x93\r    He answered me; \xc3\x92for speaking Tuscan to me,\r    It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.\r\rBy other surname do I know him not,\r    Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.\r    May God be with you, for I come no farther.\r\rBehold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,\r    Already whitening; and I must depart\xc3\x91\r    Yonder the Angel is\xc3\x91ere he appear.\xc3\x93\r\rThus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XVII\r\r\rRemember, Reader, if e\xc3\x95er in the Alps\r    A mist o\xc3\x95ertook thee, through which thou couldst see\r    Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,\r\rHow, when the vapours humid and condensed\r    Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere\r    Of the sun feebly enters in among them,\r\rAnd thy imagination will be swift\r    In coming to perceive how I re-saw\r    The sun at first, that was already setting.\r\rThus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master\r    Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud\r    To rays already dead on the low shores.\r\rO thou, Imagination, that dost steal us\r    So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,\r    Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,\r\rWho moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?\r    Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,\r    By self, or by a will that downward guides it.\r\rOf her impiety, who changed her form\r    Into the bird that most delights in singing,\r    In my imagining appeared the trace;\r\rAnd hereupon my mind was so withdrawn\r    Within itself, that from without there came\r    Nothing that then might be received by it.\r\rThen reigned within my lofty fantasy\r    One crucified, disdainful and ferocious\r    In countenance, and even thus was dying.\r\rAround him were the great Ahasuerus,\r    Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,\r    Who was in word and action so entire.\r\rAnd even as this image burst asunder\r    Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble\r    In which the water it was made of fails,\r\rThere rose up in my vision a young maiden\r    Bitterly weeping, and she said: \xc3\x92O queen,\r    Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?\r\rThou\xc3\x95st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;\r    Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,\r    Mother, at thine ere at another\xc3\x95s ruin.\xc3\x93\r\rAs sleep is broken, when upon a sudden\r    New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,\r    And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,\r\rSo this imagining of mine fell down\r    As soon as the effulgence smote my face,\r    Greater by far than what is in our wont.\r\rI turned me round to see where I might be,\r    When said a voice, \xc3\x92Here is the passage up;\xc3\x93\r    Which from all other purposes removed me,\r\rAnd made my wish so full of eagerness\r    To look and see who was it that was speaking,\r    It never rests till meeting face to face;\r\rBut as before the sun, which quells the sight,\r    And in its own excess its figure veils,\r    Even so my power was insufficient here.\r\r\xc3\x92This is a spirit divine, who in the way\r    Of going up directs us without asking,\r    And who with his own light himself conceals.\r\rHe does with us as man doth with himself;\r    For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,\r    Malignly leans already tow\xc3\x95rds denial.\r\rAccord we now our feet to such inviting,\r    Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;\r    For then we could not till the day return.\xc3\x93\r\rThus my Conductor said; and I and he\r    Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;\r    And I, as soon as the first step I reached,\r\rNear me perceived a motion as of wings,\r    And fanning in the face, and saying, \xc3\x92\xc3\x94Beati\r    Pacifici,\xc3\x95 who are without ill anger.\xc3\x93\r\rAlready over us were so uplifted\r    The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,\r    That upon many sides the stars appeared.\r\r\xc3\x92O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?\xc3\x93\r    I said within myself; for I perceived\r    The vigour of my legs was put in truce.\r\rWe at the point were where no more ascends\r    The stairway upward, and were motionless,\r    Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;\r\rAnd I gave heed a little, if I might hear\r    Aught whatsoever in the circle new;\r    Then to my Master turned me round and said:\r\r\xc3\x92Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency\r    Is purged here in the circle where we are?\r    Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92The love of good, remiss\r    In what it should have done, is here restored;\r    Here plied again the ill-belated oar;\r\rBut still more openly to understand,\r    Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather\r    Some profitable fruit from our delay.\r\rNeither Creator nor a creature ever,\r    Son,\xc3\x93 he began, \xc3\x92was destitute of love\r    Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.\r\rThe natural was ever without error;\r    But err the other may by evil object,\r    Or by too much, or by too little vigour.\r\rWhile in the first it well directed is,\r    And in the second moderates itself,\r    It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;\r\rBut when to ill it turns, and, with more care\r    Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,\r    \xc3\x95Gainst the Creator works his own creation.\r\rHence thou mayst comprehend that love must be\r    The seed within yourselves of every virtue,\r    And every act that merits punishment.\r\rNow inasmuch as never from the welfare\r    Of its own subject can love turn its sight,\r    From their own hatred all things are secure;\r\rAnd since we cannot think of any being\r    Standing alone, nor from the First divided,\r    Of hating Him is all desire cut off.\r\rHence if, discriminating, I judge well,\r    The evil that one loves is of one\xc3\x95s neighbour,\r    And this is born in three modes in your clay.\r\rThere are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,\r    Hope to excel, and therefore only long\r    That from his greatness he may be cast down;\r\rThere are, who power, grace, honour, and renown\r    Fear they may lose because another rises,\r    Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;\r\rAnd there are those whom injury seems to chafe,\r    So that it makes them greedy for revenge,\r    And such must needs shape out another\xc3\x95s harm.\r\rThis threefold love is wept for down below;\r    Now of the other will I have thee hear,\r    That runneth after good with measure faulty.\r\rEach one confusedly a good conceives\r    Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;\r    Therefore to overtake it each one strives.\r\rIf languid love to look on this attract you,\r    Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,\r    After just penitence, torments you for it.\r\rThere\xc3\x95s other good that does not make man happy;\r    \xc3\x95Tis not felicity, \xc3\x95tis not the good\r    Essence, of every good the fruit and root.\r\rThe love that yields itself too much to this\r    Above us is lamented in three circles;\r    But how tripartite it may be described,\r\rI say not, that thou seek it for thyself.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XVIII\r\r\rAn end had put unto his reasoning\r    The lofty Teacher, and attent was looking\r    Into my face, if I appeared content;\r\rAnd I, whom a new thirst still goaded on,\r    Without was mute, and said within: \xc3\x92Perchance\r    The too much questioning I make annoys him.\xc3\x93\r\rBut that true Father, who had comprehended\r    The timid wish, that opened not itself,\r    By speaking gave me hardihood to speak.\r\rWhence I: \xc3\x92My sight is, Master, vivified\r    So in thy light, that clearly I discern\r    Whate\xc3\x95er thy speech importeth or describes.\r\rTherefore I thee entreat, sweet Father dear,\r    To teach me love, to which thou dost refer\r    Every good action and its contrary.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Direct,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92towards me the keen eyes\r    Of intellect, and clear will be to thee\r    The error of the blind, who would be leaders.\r\rThe soul, which is created apt to love,\r    Is mobile unto everything that pleases,\r    Soon as by pleasure she is waked to action.\r\rYour apprehension from some real thing\r    An image draws, and in yourselves displays it\r    So that it makes the soul turn unto it.\r\rAnd if, when turned, towards it she incline,\r    Love is that inclination; it is nature,\r    Which is by pleasure bound in you anew\r\rThen even as the fire doth upward move\r    By its own form, which to ascend is born,\r    Where longest in its matter it endures,\r\rSo comes the captive soul into desire,\r    Which is a motion spiritual, and ne\xc3\x95er rests\r    Until she doth enjoy the thing beloved.\r\rNow may apparent be to thee how hidden\r    The truth is from those people, who aver\r    All love is in itself a laudable thing;\r\rBecause its matter may perchance appear\r    Aye to be good; but yet not each impression\r    Is good, albeit good may be the wax.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Thy words, and my sequacious intellect,\xc3\x93\r    I answered him, \xc3\x92have love revealed to me;\r    But that has made me more impregned with doubt;\r\rFor if love from without be offered us,\r    And with another foot the soul go not,\r    If right or wrong she go, \xc3\x95tis not her merit.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92What reason seeth here,\r    Myself can tell thee; beyond that await\r    For Beatrice, since \xc3\x95tis a work of faith.\r\rEvery substantial form, that segregate\r    From matter is, and with it is united,\r    Specific power has in itself collected,\r\rWhich without act is not perceptible,\r    Nor shows itself except by its effect,\r    As life does in a plant by the green leaves.\r\rBut still, whence cometh the intelligence\r    Of the first notions, man is ignorant,\r    And the affection for the first allurements,\r\rWhich are in you as instinct in the bee\r    To make its honey; and this first desire\r    Merit of praise or blame containeth not.\r\rNow, that to this all others may be gathered,\r    Innate within you is the power that counsels,\r    And it should keep the threshold of assent.\r\rThis is the principle, from which is taken\r    Occasion of desert in you, according\r    As good and guilty loves it takes and winnows.\r\rThose who, in reasoning, to the bottom went,\r    Were of this innate liberty aware,\r    Therefore bequeathed they Ethics to the world.\r\rSupposing, then, that from necessity\r    Springs every love that is within you kindled,\r    Within yourselves the power is to restrain it.\r\rThe noble virtue Beatrice understands\r    By the free will; and therefore see that thou\r    Bear it in mind, if she should speak of it.\xc3\x93\r\rThe moon, belated almost unto midnight,\r    Now made the stars appear to us more rare,\r    Formed like a bucket, that is all ablaze,\r\rAnd counter to the heavens ran through those paths\r    Which the sun sets aflame, when he of Rome\r    Sees it \xc3\x95twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down;\r\rAnd that patrician shade, for whom is named\r    Pietola more than any Mantuan town,\r    Had laid aside the burden of my lading;\r\rWhence I, who reason manifest and plain\r    In answer to my questions had received,\r    Stood like a man in drowsy reverie.\r\rBut taken from me was this drowsiness\r    Suddenly by a people, that behind\r    Our backs already had come round to us.\r\rAnd as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus\r    Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,\r    If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,\r\rSo they along that circle curve their step,\r    From what I saw of those approaching us,\r    Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.\r\rFull soon they were upon us, because running\r    Moved onward all that mighty multitude,\r    And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,\r\r\xc3\x92Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,\r    And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,\r    Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost\r    By little love!\xc3\x93 forthwith the others cried,\r    \xc3\x92For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O folk, in whom an eager fervour now\r    Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,\r    Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness,\r\rThis one who lives, and truly I lie not,\r    Would fain go up, if but the sun relight us;\r    So tell us where the passage nearest is.\xc3\x93\r\rThese were the words of him who was my Guide;\r    And some one of those spirits said: \xc3\x92Come on\r    Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;\r\rSo full of longing are we to move onward,\r    That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,\r    If thou for churlishness our justice take.\r\rI was San Zeno\xc3\x95s Abbot at Verona,\r    Under the empire of good Barbarossa,\r    Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse;\r\rAnd he has one foot in the grave already,\r    Who shall erelong lament that monastery,\r    And sorry be of having there had power,\r\rBecause his son, in his whole body sick,\r    And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,\r    He put into the place of its true pastor.\xc3\x93\r\rIf more he said, or silent was, I know not,\r    He had already passed so far beyond us;\r    But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.\r\rAnd he who was in every need my succour\r    Said: \xc3\x92Turn thee hitherward; see two of them\r    Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth.\xc3\x93\r\rIn rear of all they shouted: \xc3\x92Sooner were\r    The people dead to whom the sea was opened,\r    Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;\r\rAnd those who the fatigue did not endure\r    Unto the issue, with Anchises\xc3\x95 son,\r    Themselves to life withouten glory offered.\xc3\x93\r\rThen when from us so separated were\r    Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,\r    Within me a new thought did entrance find,\r\rWhence others many and diverse were born;\r    And so I lapsed from one into another,\r    That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,\r\rAnd meditation into dream transmuted.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XIX\r\r\rIt was the hour when the diurnal heat\r    No more can warm the coldness of the moon,\r    Vanquished by earth, or peradventure Saturn,\r\rWhen geomancers their Fortuna Major\r    See in the orient before the dawn\r    Rise by a path that long remains not dim,\r\rThere came to me in dreams a stammering woman,\r    Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,\r    With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.\r\rI looked at her; and as the sun restores\r    The frigid members which the night benumbs,\r    Even thus my gaze did render voluble\r\rHer tongue, and made her all erect thereafter\r    In little while, and the lost countenance\r    As love desires it so in her did colour.\r\rWhen in this wise she had her speech unloosed,\r    She \xc3\x95gan to sing so, that with difficulty\r    Could I have turned my thoughts away from her.\r\r\xc3\x92I am,\xc3\x93 she sang, \xc3\x92I am the Siren sweet\r    Who mariners amid the main unman,\r    So full am I of pleasantness to hear.\r\rI drew Ulysses from his wandering way\r    Unto my song, and he who dwells with me\r    Seldom departs so wholly I content him.\xc3\x93\r\rHer mouth was not yet closed again, before\r    Appeared a Lady saintly and alert\r    Close at my side to put her to confusion.\r\r\xc3\x92Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?\xc3\x93\r    Sternly she said; and he was drawing near\r    With eyes still fixed upon that modest one.\r\rShe seized the other and in front laid open,\r    Rending her garments, and her belly showed me;\r    This waked me with the stench that issued from it.\r\rI turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said:\r    \xc3\x92At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come;\r    Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter.\xc3\x93\r\rI rose; and full already of high day\r    Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain,\r    And with the new sun at our back we went.\r\rFollowing behind him, I my forehead bore\r    Like unto one who has it laden with thought,\r    Who makes himself the half arch of a bridge,\r\rWhen I heard say, \xc3\x92Come, here the passage is,\xc3\x93\r    Spoken in a manner gentle and benign,\r    Such as we hear not in this mortal region.\r\rWith open wings, which of a swan appeared,\r    Upward he turned us who thus spake to us,\r    Between the two walls of the solid granite.\r\rHe moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us,\r    Affirming those \xc3\x94qui lugent\xc3\x95 to be blessed,\r    For they shall have their souls with comfort filled.\r\r\xc3\x92What aileth thee, that aye to earth thou gazest?\xc3\x93\r    To me my Guide began to say, we both\r    Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted.\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92With such misgiving makes me go\r    A vision new, which bends me to itself,\r    So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Didst thou behold,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92that old enchantress,\r    Who sole above us henceforth is lamented?\r    Didst thou behold how man is freed from her?\r\rSuffice it thee, and smite earth with thy heels,\r    Thine eyes lift upward to the lure, that whirls\r    The Eternal King with revolutions vast.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as the hawk, that first his feet surveys,\r    Then turns him to the call and stretches forward,\r    Through the desire of food that draws him thither,\r\rSuch I became, and such, as far as cleaves\r    The rock to give a way to him who mounts,\r    Went on to where the circling doth begin.\r\rOn the fifth circle when I had come forth,\r    People I saw upon it who were weeping,\r    Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned.\r\r\xc3\x92Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,\xc3\x93\r    I heard them say with sighings so profound,\r    That hardly could the words be understood.\r\r\xc3\x92O ye elect of God, whose sufferings\r    Justice and Hope both render less severe,\r    Direct ye us towards the high ascents.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92If ye are come secure from this prostration,\r    And wish to find the way most speedily,\r    Let your right hands be evermore outside.\xc3\x93\r\rThus did the Poet ask, and thus was answered\r    By them somewhat in front of us; whence I\r    In what was spoken divined the rest concealed,\r\rAnd unto my Lord\xc3\x95s eyes mine eyes I turned;\r    Whence he assented with a cheerful sign\r    To what the sight of my desire implored.\r\rWhen of myself I could dispose at will,\r    Above that creature did I draw myself,\r    Whose words before had caused me to take note,\r\rSaying: \xc3\x92O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens\r    That without which to God we cannot turn,\r    Suspend awhile for me thy greater care.\r\rWho wast thou, and why are your backs turned upwards,\r    Tell me, and if thou wouldst that I procure thee\r    Anything there whence living I departed.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Wherefore our backs the heaven\r    Turns to itself, know shalt thou; but beforehand\r    \xc3\x94Scias quod ego fui successor Petri.\xc3\x95\r\rBetween Siestri and Chiaveri descends\r    A river beautiful, and of its name\r    The title of my blood its summit makes.\r\rA month and little more essayed I how\r    Weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it,\r    For all the other burdens seem a feather.\r\rTardy, ah woe is me! was my conversion;\r    But when the Roman Shepherd I was made,\r    Then I discovered life to be a lie.\r\rI saw that there the heart was not at rest,\r    Nor farther in that life could one ascend;\r    Whereby the love of this was kindled in me.\r\rUntil that time a wretched soul and parted\r    From God was I, and wholly avaricious;\r    Now, as thou seest, I here am punished for it.\r\rWhat avarice does is here made manifest\r    In the purgation of these souls converted,\r    And no more bitter pain the Mountain has.\r\rEven as our eye did not uplift itself\r    Aloft, being fastened upon earthly things,\r    So justice here has merged it in the earth.\r\rAs avarice had extinguished our affection\r    For every good, whereby was action lost,\r    So justice here doth hold us in restraint,\r\rBound and imprisoned by the feet and hands;\r    And so long as it pleases the just Lord\r    Shall we remain immovable and prostrate.\xc3\x93\r\rI on my knees had fallen, and wished to speak;\r    But even as I began, and he was \xc3\x95ware,\r    Only by listening, of my reverence,\r\r\xc3\x92What cause,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92has downward bent thee thus?\xc3\x93\r    And I to him: \xc3\x92For your own dignity,\r    Standing, my conscience stung me with remorse.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Straighten thy legs, and upward raise thee, brother,\xc3\x93\r    He answered: \xc3\x92Err not, fellow-servant am I\r    With thee and with the others to one power.\r\rIf e\xc3\x95er that holy, evangelic sound,\r    Which sayeth \xc3\x94neque nubent,\xc3\x95 thou hast heard,\r    Well canst thou see why in this wise I speak.\r\rNow go; no longer will I have thee linger,\r    Because thy stay doth incommode my weeping,\r    With which I ripen that which thou hast said.\r\rOn earth I have a grandchild named Alagia,\r    Good in herself, unless indeed our house\r    Malevolent may make her by example,\r\rAnd she alone remains to me on earth.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XX\r\r\rIll strives the will against a better will;\r    Therefore, to pleasure him, against my pleasure\r    I drew the sponge not saturate from the water.\r\rOnward I moved, and onward moved my Leader,\r    Through vacant places, skirting still the rock,\r    As on a wall close to the battlements;\r\rFor they that through their eyes pour drop by drop\r    The malady which all the world pervades,\r    On the other side too near the verge approach.\r\rAccursed mayst thou be, thou old she-wolf,\r    That more than all the other beasts hast prey,\r    Because of hunger infinitely hollow!\r\rO heaven, in whose gyrations some appear\r    To think conditions here below are changed,\r    When will he come through whom she shall depart?\r\rOnward we went with footsteps slow and scarce,\r    And I attentive to the shades I heard\r    Piteously weeping and bemoaning them;\r\rAnd I by peradventure heard \xc3\x92Sweet Mary!\xc3\x93\r    Uttered in front of us amid the weeping\r    Even as a woman does who is in child-birth;\r\rAnd in continuance: \xc3\x92How poor thou wast\r    Is manifested by that hostelry\r    Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.\xc3\x93\r\rThereafterward I heard: \xc3\x92O good Fabricius,\r    Virtue with poverty didst thou prefer\r    To the possession of great wealth with vice.\xc3\x93\r\rSo pleasurable were these words to me\r    That I drew farther onward to have knowledge\r    Touching that spirit whence they seemed to come.\r\rHe furthermore was speaking of the largess\r    Which Nicholas unto the maidens gave,\r    In order to conduct their youth to honour.\r\r\xc3\x92O soul that dost so excellently speak,\r    Tell me who wast thou,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92and why only\r    Thou dost renew these praises well deserved?\r\rNot without recompense shall be thy word,\r    If I return to finish the short journey\r    Of that life which is flying to its end.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he: \xc3\x92I\xc3\x95ll tell thee, not for any comfort\r    I may expect from earth, but that so much\r    Grace shines in thee or ever thou art dead.\r\rI was the root of that malignant plant\r    Which overshadows all the Christian world,\r    So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it;\r\rBut if Douay and Ghent, and Lille and Bruges\r    Had Power, soon vengeance would be taken on it;\r    And this I pray of Him who judges all.\r\rHugh Capet was I called upon the earth;\r    From me were born the Louises and Philips,\r    By whom in later days has France been governed.\r\rI was the son of a Parisian butcher,\r    What time the ancient kings had perished all,\r    Excepting one, contrite in cloth of gray.\r\rI found me grasping in my hands the rein\r    Of the realm\xc3\x95s government, and so great power\r    Of new acquest, and so with friends abounding,\r\rThat to the widowed diadem promoted\r    The head of mine own offspring was, from whom\r    The consecrated bones of these began.\r\rSo long as the great dowry of Provence\r    Out of my blood took not the sense of shame,\r    \xc3\x95Twas little worth, but still it did no harm.\r\rThen it began with falsehood and with force\r    Its rapine; and thereafter, for amends,\r    Took Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony.\r\rCharles came to Italy, and for amends\r    A victim made of Conradin, and then\r    Thrust Thomas back to heaven, for amends.\r\rA time I see, not very distant now,\r    Which draweth forth another Charles from France,\r    The better to make known both him and his.\r\rUnarmed he goes, and only with the lance\r    That Judas jousted with; and that he thrusts\r    So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst.\r\rHe thence not land, but sin and infamy,\r    Shall gain, so much more grievous to himself\r    As the more light such damage he accounts.\r\rThe other, now gone forth, ta\xc3\x95en in his ship,\r    See I his daughter sell, and chaffer for her\r    As corsairs do with other female slaves.\r\rWhat more, O Avarice, canst thou do to us,\r    Since thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn,\r    It careth not for its own proper flesh?\r\rThat less may seem the future ill and past,\r    I see the flower-de-luce Alagna enter,\r    And Christ in his own Vicar captive made.\r\rI see him yet another time derided;\r    I see renewed the vinegar and gall,\r    And between living thieves I see him slain.\r\rI see the modern Pilate so relentless,\r    This does not sate him, but without decretal\r    He to the temple bears his sordid sails!\r\rWhen, O my Lord! shall I be joyful made\r    By looking on the vengeance which, concealed,\r    Makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy?\r\rWhat I was saying of that only bride\r    Of the Holy Ghost, and which occasioned thee\r    To turn towards me for some commentary,\r\rSo long has been ordained to all our prayers\r    As the day lasts; but when the night comes on,\r    Contrary sound we take instead thereof.\r\rAt that time we repeat Pygmalion,\r    Of whom a traitor, thief, and parricide\r    Made his insatiable desire of gold;\r\rAnd the misery of avaricious Midas,\r    That followed his inordinate demand,\r    At which forevermore one needs but laugh.\r\rThe foolish Achan each one then records,\r    And how he stole the spoils; so that the wrath\r    Of Joshua still appears to sting him here.\r\rThen we accuse Sapphira with her husband,\r    We laud the hoof-beats Heliodorus had,\r    And the whole mount in infamy encircles\r\rPolymnestor who murdered Polydorus.\r    Here finally is cried: \xc3\x94O Crassus, tell us,\r    For thou dost know, what is the taste of gold?\xc3\x95\r\rSometimes we speak, one loud, another low,\r    According to desire of speech, that spurs us\r    To greater now and now to lesser pace.\r\rBut in the good that here by day is talked of,\r    Erewhile alone I was not; yet near by\r    No other person lifted up his voice.\xc3\x93\r\rFrom him already we departed were,\r    And made endeavour to o\xc3\x95ercome the road\r    As much as was permitted to our power,\r\rWhen I perceived, like something that is falling,\r    The mountain tremble, whence a chill seized on me,\r    As seizes him who to his death is going.\r\rCertes so violently shook not Delos,\r    Before Latona made her nest therein\r    To give birth to the two eyes of the heaven.\r\rThen upon all sides there began a cry,\r    Such that the Master drew himself towards me,\r    Saying, \xc3\x92Fear not, while I am guiding thee.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Gloria in excelsis Deo,\xc3\x93 all\r    Were saying, from what near I comprehended,\r    Where it was possible to hear the cry.\r\rWe paused immovable and in suspense,\r    Even as the shepherds who first heard that song,\r    Until the trembling ceased, and it was finished.\r\rThen we resumed again our holy path,\r    Watching the shades that lay upon the ground,\r    Already turned to their accustomed plaint.\r\rNo ignorance ever with so great a strife\r    Had rendered me importunate to know,\r    If erreth not in this my memory,\r\rAs meditating then I seemed to have;\r    Nor out of haste to question did I dare,\r    Nor of myself I there could aught perceive;\r\rSo I went onward timorous and thoughtful.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXI\r\r\rThe natural thirst, that ne\xc3\x95er is satisfied\r    Excepting with the water for whose grace\r    The woman of Samaria besought,\r\rPut me in travail, and haste goaded me\r    Along the encumbered path behind my Leader\r    And I was pitying that righteous vengeance;\r\rAnd lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth\r    That Christ appeared to two upon the way\r    From the sepulchral cave already risen,\r\rA shade appeared to us, and came behind us,\r    Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,\r    Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,\r\rSaying, \xc3\x92My brothers, may God give you peace!\xc3\x93\r    We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered\r    To him the countersign thereto conforming.\r\rThereon began he: \xc3\x92In the blessed council,\r    Thee may the court veracious place in peace,\r    That me doth banish in eternal exile!\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92How,\xc3\x93 said he, and the while we went with speed,\r    \xc3\x92If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,\r    Who up his stairs so far has guided you?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd said my Teacher: \xc3\x92If thou note the marks\r    Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces\r    Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.\r\rBut because she who spinneth day and night\r    For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,\r    Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,\r\rHis soul, which is thy sister and my own,\r    In coming upwards could not come alone,\r    By reason that it sees not in our fashion.\r\rWhence I was drawn from out the ample throat\r    Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him\r    As far on as my school has power to lead.\r\rBut tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder\r    Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together\r    All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?\xc3\x93\r\rIn asking he so hit the very eye\r    Of my desire, that merely with the hope\r    My thirst became the less unsatisfied.\r\r\xc3\x92Naught is there,\xc3\x93 he began, \xc3\x92that without order\r    May the religion of the mountain feel,\r    Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom.\r\rFree is it here from every permutation;\r    What from itself heaven in itself receiveth\r    Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;\r\rBecause that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,\r    Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls\r    Than the short, little stairway of three steps.\r\rDense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,\r    Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,\r    That often upon earth her region shifts;\r\rNo arid vapour any farther rises\r    Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,\r    Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.\r\rLower down perchance it trembles less or more,\r    But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden\r    I know not how, up here it never trembled.\r\rIt trembles here, whenever any soul\r    Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves\r    To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.\r\rOf purity the will alone gives proof,\r    Which, being wholly free to change its convent,\r    Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.\r\rFirst it wills well; but the desire permits not,\r    Which divine justice with the self-same will\r    There was to sin, upon the torment sets.\r\rAnd I, who have been lying in this pain\r    Five hundred years and more, but just now felt\r    A free volition for a better seat.\r\rTherefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious\r    Spirits along the mountain rendering praise\r    Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards.\xc3\x93\r\rSo said he to him; and since we enjoy\r    As much in drinking as the thirst is great,\r    I could not say how much it did me good.\r\rAnd the wise Leader: \xc3\x92Now I see the net\r    That snares you here, and how ye are set free,\r    Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice.\r\rNow who thou wast be pleased that I may know;\r    And why so many centuries thou hast here\r    Been lying, let me gather from thy words.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92In days when the good Titus, with the aid\r    Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds\r    Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold,\r\rUnder the name that most endures and honours,\r    Was I on earth,\xc3\x93 that spirit made reply,\r    \xc3\x92Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet.\r\rMy vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome\r    Me, a Thoulousian, drew unto herself,\r    Where I deserved to deck my brows with myrtle.\r\rStatius the people name me still on earth;\r    I sang of Thebes, and then of great Achilles;\r    But on the way fell with my second burden.\r\rThe seeds unto my ardour were the sparks\r    Of that celestial flame which heated me,\r    Whereby more than a thousand have been fired;\r\rOf the Aeneid speak I, which to me\r    A mother was, and was my nurse in song;\r    Without this weighed I not a drachma\xc3\x95s weight.\r\rAnd to have lived upon the earth what time\r    Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun\r    More than I must ere issuing from my ban.\xc3\x93\r\rThese words towards me made Virgilius turn\r    With looks that in their silence said, \xc3\x92Be silent!\xc3\x93\r    But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;\r\rFor tears and laughter are such pursuivants\r    Unto the passion from which each springs forth,\r    In the most truthful least the will they follow.\r\rI only smiled, as one who gives the wink;\r    Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed\r    Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;\r\rAnd, \xc3\x92As thou well mayst consummate a labour\r    So great,\xc3\x93 it said, \xc3\x92why did thy face just now\r    Display to me the lightning of a smile?\xc3\x93\r\rNow am I caught on this side and on that;\r    One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,\r    Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.\r\r\xc3\x92Speak,\xc3\x93 said my Master, \xc3\x92and be not afraid\r    Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him\r    What he demands with such solicitude.\xc3\x93\r\rWhence I: \xc3\x92Thou peradventure marvellest,\r    O antique spirit, at the smile I gave;\r    But I will have more wonder seize upon thee.\r\rThis one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,\r    Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn\r    To sing aloud of men and of the Gods.\r\rIf other cause thou to my smile imputedst,\r    Abandon it as false, and trust it was\r    Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him.\xc3\x93\r\rAlready he was stooping to embrace\r    My Teacher\xc3\x95s feet; but he said to him: \xc3\x92Brother,\r    Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he uprising: \xc3\x92Now canst thou the sum\r    Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,\r    When this our vanity I disremember,\r\rTreating a shadow as substantial thing.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXII\r\r\rAlready was the Angel left behind us,\r    The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us,\r    Having erased one mark from off my face;\r\rAnd those who have in justice their desire\r    Had said to us, \xc3\x92Beati,\xc3\x93 in their voices,\r    With \xc3\x92sitio,\xc3\x93 and without more ended it.\r\rAnd I, more light than through the other passes,\r    Went onward so, that without any labour\r    I followed upward the swift-footed spirits;\r\rWhen thus Virgilius began: \xc3\x92The love\r    Kindled by virtue aye another kindles,\r    Provided outwardly its flame appear.\r\rHence from the hour that Juvenal descended\r    Among us into the infernal Limbo,\r    Who made apparent to me thy affection,\r\rMy kindliness towards thee was as great\r    As ever bound one to an unseen person,\r    So that these stairs will now seem short to me.\r\rBut tell me, and forgive me as a friend,\r    If too great confidence let loose the rein,\r    And as a friend now hold discourse with me;\r\rHow was it possible within thy breast\r    For avarice to find place, \xc3\x95mid so much wisdom\r    As thou wast filled with by thy diligence?\xc3\x93\r\rThese words excited Statius at first\r    Somewhat to laughter; afterward he answered:\r    \xc3\x92Each word of thine is love\xc3\x95s dear sign to me.\r\rVerily oftentimes do things appear\r    Which give fallacious matter to our doubts,\r    Instead of the true causes which are hidden!\r\rThy question shows me thy belief to be\r    That I was niggard in the other life,\r    It may be from the circle where I was;\r\rTherefore know thou, that avarice was removed\r    Too far from me; and this extravagance\r    Thousands of lunar periods have punished.\r\rAnd were it not that I my thoughts uplifted,\r    When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest,\r    As if indignant, unto human nature,\r\r\xc3\x94To what impellest thou not, O cursed hunger\r    Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?\xc3\x95\r    Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings.\r\rThen I perceived the hands could spread too wide\r    Their wings in spending, and repented me\r    As well of that as of my other sins;\r\rHow many with shorn hair shall rise again\r    Because of ignorance, which from this sin\r    Cuts off repentance living and in death!\r\rAnd know that the transgression which rebuts\r    By direct opposition any sin\r    Together with it here its verdure dries.\r\rTherefore if I have been among that folk\r    Which mourns its avarice, to purify me,\r    For its opposite has this befallen me.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Now when thou sangest the relentless weapons\r    Of the twofold affliction of Jocasta,\xc3\x93\r    The singer of the Songs Bucolic said,\r\r\xc3\x92From that which Clio there with thee preludes,\r    It does not seem that yet had made thee faithful\r    That faith without which no good works suffice.\r\rIf this be so, what candles or what sun\r    Scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim\r    Thy sails behind the Fisherman thereafter?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to him: \xc3\x92Thou first directedst me\r    Towards Parnassus, in its grots to drink,\r    And first concerning God didst me enlighten.\r\rThou didst as he who walketh in the night,\r    Who bears his light behind, which helps him not,\r    But wary makes the persons after him,\r\rWhen thou didst say: \xc3\x94The age renews itself,\r    Justice returns, and man\xc3\x95s primeval time,\r    And a new progeny descends from heaven.\xc3\x95\r\rThrough thee I Poet was, through thee a Christian;\r    But that thou better see what I design,\r    To colour it will I extend my hand.\r\rAlready was the world in every part\r    Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated\r    By messengers of the eternal kingdom;\r\rAnd thy assertion, spoken of above,\r    With the new preachers was in unison;\r    Whence I to visit them the custom took.\r\rThen they became so holy in my sight,\r    That, when Domitian persecuted them,\r    Not without tears of mine were their laments;\r\rAnd all the while that I on earth remained,\r    Them I befriended, and their upright customs\r    Made me disparage all the other sects.\r\rAnd ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers\r    Of Thebes, in poetry, I was baptized,\r    But out of fear was covertly a Christian,\r\rFor a long time professing paganism;\r    And this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle\r    To circuit round more than four centuries.\r\rThou, therefore, who hast raised the covering\r    That hid from me whatever good I speak of,\r    While in ascending we have time to spare,\r\rTell me, in what place is our friend Terentius,\r    Caecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou knowest;\r    Tell me if they are damned, and in what alley.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92These, Persius and myself, and others many,\xc3\x93\r    Replied my Leader, \xc3\x92with that Grecian are\r    Whom more than all the rest the Muses suckled,\r\rIn the first circle of the prison blind;\r    Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse\r    Which has our nurses ever with itself.\r\rEuripides is with us, Antiphon,\r    Simonides, Agatho, and many other\r    Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked.\r\rThere some of thine own people may be seen,\r    Antigone, Deiphile and Argia,\r    And there Ismene mournful as of old.\r\rThere she is seen who pointed out Langia;\r    There is Tiresias\xc3\x95 daughter, and there Thetis,\r    And there Deidamia with her sisters.\xc3\x93\r\rSilent already were the poets both,\r    Attent once more in looking round about,\r    From the ascent and from the walls released;\r\rAnd four handmaidens of the day already\r    Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth\r    Was pointing upward still its burning horn,\r\rWhat time my Guide: \xc3\x92I think that tow\xc3\x95rds the edge\r    Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn,\r    Circling the mount as we are wont to do.\xc3\x93\r\rThus in that region custom was our ensign;\r    And we resumed our way with less suspicion\r    For the assenting of that worthy soul\r\rThey in advance went on, and I alone\r    Behind them, and I listened to their speech,\r    Which gave me lessons in the art of song.\r\rBut soon their sweet discourses interrupted\r    A tree which midway in the road we found,\r    With apples sweet and grateful to the smell.\r\rAnd even as a fir-tree tapers upward\r    From bough to bough, so downwardly did that;\r    I think in order that no one might climb it.\r\rOn that side where our pathway was enclosed\r    Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water,\r    And spread itself abroad upon the leaves.\r\rThe Poets twain unto the tree drew near,\r    And from among the foliage a voice\r    Cried: \xc3\x92Of this food ye shall have scarcity.\xc3\x93\r\rThen said: \xc3\x92More thoughtful Mary was of making\r    The marriage feast complete and honourable,\r    Than of her mouth which now for you responds;\r\rAnd for their drink the ancient Roman women\r    With water were content; and Daniel\r    Disparaged food, and understanding won.\r\rThe primal age was beautiful as gold;\r    Acorns it made with hunger savorous,\r    And nectar every rivulet with thirst.\r\rHoney and locusts were the aliments\r    That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;\r    Whence he is glorious, and so magnified\r\rAs by the Evangel is revealed to you.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXIII\r\r\rThe while among the verdant leaves mine eyes\r    I riveted, as he is wont to do\r    Who wastes his life pursuing little birds,\r\rMy more than Father said unto me: \xc3\x92Son,\r    Come now; because the time that is ordained us\r    More usefully should be apportioned out.\xc3\x93\r\rI turned my face and no less soon my steps\r    Unto the Sages, who were speaking so\r    They made the going of no cost to me;\r\rAnd lo! were heard a song and a lament,\r    \xc3\x92Labia mea, Domine,\xc3\x93 in fashion\r    Such that delight and dolence it brought forth.\r\r\xc3\x92O my sweet Father, what is this I hear?\xc3\x93\r    Began I; and he answered: \xc3\x92Shades that go\r    Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt.\xc3\x93\r\rIn the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do,\r    Who, unknown people on the road o\xc3\x95ertaking,\r    Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop,\r\rEven thus, behind us with a swifter motion\r    Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us\r    A crowd of spirits silent and devout.\r\rEach in his eyes was dark and cavernous,\r    Pallid in face, and so emaciate\r    That from the bones the skin did shape itself.\r\rI do not think that so to merest rind\r    Could Erisichthon have been withered up\r    By famine, when most fear he had of it.\r\rThinking within myself I said: \xc3\x92Behold,\r    This is the folk who lost Jerusalem,\r    When Mary made a prey of her own son.\xc3\x93\r\rTheir sockets were like rings without the gems;\r    Whoever in the face of men reads \xc3\x94omo\xc3\x95\r    Might well in these have recognised the \xc3\x94m.\xc3\x95\r\rWho would believe the odour of an apple,\r    Begetting longing, could consume them so,\r    And that of water, without knowing how?\r\rI still was wondering what so famished them,\r    For the occasion not yet manifest\r    Of their emaciation and sad squalor;\r\rAnd lo! from out the hollow of his head\r    His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;\r    Then cried aloud: \xc3\x92What grace to me is this?\xc3\x93\r\rNever should I have known him by his look;\r    But in his voice was evident to me\r    That which his aspect had suppressed within it.\r\rThis spark within me wholly re-enkindled\r    My recognition of his altered face,\r    And I recalled the features of Forese.\r\r\xc3\x92Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,\xc3\x93\r    Entreated he, \xc3\x92which doth my skin discolour,\r    Nor at default of flesh that I may have;\r\rBut tell me truth of thee, and who are those\r    Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;\r    Do not delay in speaking unto me.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,\r    Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,\xc3\x93\r    I answered him, \xc3\x92beholding it so changed!\r\rBut tell me, for God\xc3\x95s sake, what thus denudes you?\r    Make me not speak while I am marvelling,\r    For ill speaks he who\xc3\x95s full of other longings.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92From the eternal council\r    Falls power into the water and the tree\r    Behind us left, whereby I grow so thin.\r\rAll of this people who lamenting sing,\r    For following beyond measure appetite\r    In hunger and thirst are here re-sanctified.\r\rDesire to eat and drink enkindles in us\r    The scent that issues from the apple-tree,\r    And from the spray that sprinkles o\xc3\x95er the verdure;\r\rAnd not a single time alone, this ground\r    Encompassing, is refreshed our pain,\xc3\x91\r    I say our pain, and ought to say our solace,\xc3\x91\r\rFor the same wish doth lead us to the tree\r    Which led the Christ rejoicing to say \xc3\x94Eli,\xc3\x95\r    When with his veins he liberated us.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92Forese, from that day\r    When for a better life thou changedst worlds,\r    Up to this time five years have not rolled round.\r\rIf sooner were the power exhausted in thee\r    Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised\r    Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us,\r\rHow hast thou come up hitherward already?\r    I thought to find thee down there underneath,\r    Where time for time doth restitution make.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Thus speedily has led me\r    To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments,\r    My Nella with her overflowing tears;\r\rShe with her prayers devout and with her sighs\r    Has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits,\r    And from the other circles set me free.\r\rSo much more dear and pleasing is to God\r    My little widow, whom so much I loved,\r    As in good works she is the more alone;\r\rFor the Barbagia of Sardinia\r    By far more modest in its women is\r    Than the Barbagia I have left her in.\r\rO brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say?\r    A future time is in my sight already,\r    To which this hour will not be very old,\r\rWhen from the pulpit shall be interdicted\r    To the unblushing womankind of Florence\r    To go about displaying breast and paps.\r\rWhat savages were e\xc3\x95er, what Saracens,\r    Who stood in need, to make them covered go,\r    Of spiritual or other discipline?\r\rBut if the shameless women were assured\r    Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already\r    Wide open would they have their mouths to howl;\r\rFor if my foresight here deceive me not,\r    They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks\r    Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby.\r\rO brother, now no longer hide thee from me;\r    See that not only I, but all these people\r    Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun.\xc3\x93\r\rWhence I to him: \xc3\x92If thou bring back to mind\r    What thou with me hast been and I with thee,\r    The present memory will be grievous still.\r\rOut of that life he turned me back who goes\r    In front of me, two days agone when round\r    The sister of him yonder showed herself,\xc3\x93\r\rAnd to the sun I pointed.  \xc3\x92Through the deep\r    Night of the truly dead has this one led me,\r    With this true flesh, that follows after him.\r\rThence his encouragements have led me up,\r    Ascending and still circling round the mount\r    That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked.\r\rHe says that he will bear me company,\r    Till I shall be where Beatrice will be;\r    There it behoves me to remain without him.\r\rThis is Virgilius, who thus says to me,\xc3\x93\r    And him I pointed at; \xc3\x92the other is\r    That shade for whom just now shook every slope\r\rYour realm, that from itself discharges him.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXIV\r\r\rNor speech the going, nor the going that\r    Slackened; but talking we went bravely on,\r    Even as a vessel urged by a good wind.\r\rAnd shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,\r    From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed\r    Wonder at me, aware that I was living.\r\rAnd I, continuing my colloquy,\r    Said: \xc3\x92Peradventure he goes up more slowly\r    Than he would do, for other people\xc3\x95s sake.\r\rBut tell me, if thou knowest, where is Piccarda;\r    Tell me if any one of note I see\r    Among this folk that gazes at me so.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92My sister, who, \xc3\x95twixt beautiful and good,\r    I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing\r    Already in her crown on high Olympus.\xc3\x93\r\rSo said he first, and then: \xc3\x92\xc3\x95Tis not forbidden\r    To name each other here, so milked away\r    Is our resemblance by our dieting.\r\rThis,\xc3\x93 pointing with his finger, \xc3\x92is Buonagiunta,\r    Buonagiunta, of Lucca; and that face\r    Beyond him there, more peaked than the others,\r\rHas held the holy Church within his arms;\r    From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting\r    Bolsena\xc3\x95s eels and the Vernaccia wine.\xc3\x93\r\rHe named me many others one by one;\r    And all contented seemed at being named,\r    So that for this I saw not one dark look.\r\rI saw for hunger bite the empty air\r    Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,\r    Who with his crook had pastured many people.\r\rI saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure\r    Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,\r    And he was one who ne\xc3\x95er felt satisfied.\r\rBut as he does who scans, and then doth prize\r    One more than others, did I him of Lucca,\r    Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.\r\rHe murmured, and I know not what Gentucca\r    From that place heard I, where he felt the wound\r    Of justice, that doth macerate them so.\r\r\xc3\x92O soul,\xc3\x93 I said, \xc3\x92that seemest so desirous\r    To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,\r    And with thy speech appease thyself and me.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,\xc3\x93\r    Began he, \xc3\x92who to thee shall pleasant make\r    My city, howsoever men may blame it.\r\rThou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;\r    If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,\r    True things hereafter will declare it to thee.\r\rBut say if him I here behold, who forth\r    Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,\r    \xc3\x94Ladies, that have intelligence of love?\xc3\x95\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92One am I, who, whenever\r    Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure\r    Which he within me dictates, singing go.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O brother, now I see,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92the knot\r    Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held\r    Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.\r\rI do perceive full clearly how your pens\r    Go closely following after him who dictates,\r    Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;\r\rAnd he who sets himself to go beyond,\r    No difference sees from one style to another;\xc3\x93\r    And as if satisfied, he held his peace.\r\rEven as the birds, that winter tow\xc3\x95rds the Nile,\r    Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,\r    Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;\r\rIn such wise all the people who were there,\r    Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,\r    Both by their leanness and their wishes light.\r\rAnd as a man, who weary is with trotting,\r    Lets his companions onward go, and walks,\r    Until he vents the panting of his chest;\r\rSo did Forese let the holy flock\r    Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,\r    \xc3\x92When will it be that I again shall see thee?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92How long,\xc3\x93 I answered, \xc3\x92I may live, I know not;\r    Yet my return will not so speedy be,\r    But I shall sooner in desire arrive;\r\rBecause the place where I was set to live\r    From day to day of good is more depleted,\r    And unto dismal ruin seems ordained.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Now go,\xc3\x93 he said, \xc3\x92for him most guilty of it\r    At a beast\xc3\x95s tail behold I dragged along\r    Towards the valley where is no repentance.\r\rFaster at every step the beast is going,\r    Increasing evermore until it smites him,\r    And leaves the body vilely mutilated.\r\rNot long those wheels shall turn,\xc3\x93 and he uplifted\r    His eyes to heaven, \xc3\x92ere shall be clear to thee\r    That which my speech no farther can declare.\r\rNow stay behind; because the time so precious\r    Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much\r    By coming onward thus abreast with thee.\xc3\x93\r\rAs sometimes issues forth upon a gallop\r    A cavalier from out a troop that ride,\r    And seeks the honour of the first encounter,\r\rSo he with greater strides departed from us;\r    And on the road remained I with those two,\r    Who were such mighty marshals of the world.\r\rAnd when before us he had gone so far\r    Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants\r    As was my understanding to his words,\r\rAppeared to me with laden and living boughs\r    Another apple-tree, and not far distant,\r    From having but just then turned thitherward.\r\rPeople I saw beneath it lift their hands,\r    And cry I know not what towards the leaves,\r    Like little children eager and deluded,\r\rWho pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,\r    But, to make very keen their appetite,\r    Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.\r\rThen they departed as if undeceived;\r    And now we came unto the mighty tree\r    Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.\r\r\xc3\x92Pass farther onward without drawing near;\r    The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,\r    And out of that one has this tree been raised.\xc3\x93\r\rThus said I know not who among the branches;\r    Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself\r    Went crowding forward on the side that rises.\r\r\xc3\x92Be mindful,\xc3\x93 said he, \xc3\x92of the accursed ones\r    Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate\r    Combated Theseus with their double breasts;\r\rAnd of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,\r    Whence Gideon would not have them for companions\r    When he tow\xc3\x95rds Midian the hills descended.\xc3\x93\r\rThus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,\r    On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,\r    Followed forsooth by miserable gains;\r\rThen set at large upon the lonely road,\r    A thousand steps and more we onward went,\r    In contemplation, each without a word.\r\r\xc3\x92What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?\xc3\x93\r    Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started\r    As terrified and timid beasts are wont.\r\rI raised my head to see who this might be,\r    And never in a furnace was there seen\r    Metals or glass so lucent and so red\r\rAs one I saw who said: \xc3\x92If it may please you\r    To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;\r    This way goes he who goeth after peace.\xc3\x93\r\rHis aspect had bereft me of my sight,\r    So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,\r    Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.\r\rAnd as, the harbinger of early dawn,\r    The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,\r    Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,\r\rSo did I feel a breeze strike in the midst\r    My front, and felt the moving of the plumes\r    That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;\r\rAnd heard it said: \xc3\x92Blessed are they whom grace\r    So much illumines, that the love of taste\r    Excites not in their breasts too great desire,\r\rHungering at all times so far as is just.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXV\r\r\rNow was it the ascent no hindrance brooked,\r    Because the sun had his meridian circle\r    To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio;\r\rWherefore as doth a man who tarries not,\r    But goes his way, whate\xc3\x95er to him appear,\r    If of necessity the sting transfix him,\r\rIn this wise did we enter through the gap,\r    Taking the stairway, one before the other,\r    Which by its narrowness divides the climbers.\r\rAnd as the little stork that lifts its wing\r    With a desire to fly, and does not venture\r    To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop,\r\rEven such was I, with the desire of asking\r    Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming\r    He makes who doth address himself to speak.\r\rNot for our pace, though rapid it might be,\r    My father sweet forbore, but said: \xc3\x92Let fly\r    The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn.\xc3\x93\r\rWith confidence I opened then my mouth,\r    And I began: \xc3\x92How can one meagre grow\r    There where the need of nutriment applies not?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager\r    Was wasted by the wasting of a brand,\r    This would not,\xc3\x93 said he, \xc3\x92be to thee so sour;\r\rAnd wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion\r    Trembles within a mirror your own image;\r    That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee.\r\rBut that thou mayst content thee in thy wish\r    Lo Statius here; and him I call and pray\r    He now will be the healer of thy wounds.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,\xc3\x93\r    Responded Statius, \xc3\x92where thou present art,\r    Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee.\xc3\x93\r\rThen he began: \xc3\x92Son, if these words of mine\r    Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive,\r    They\xc3\x95ll be thy light unto the How thou sayest.\r\rThe perfect blood, which never is drunk up\r    Into the thirsty veins, and which remaineth\r    Like food that from the table thou removest,\r\rTakes in the heart for all the human members\r    Virtue informative, as being that\r    Which to be changed to them goes through the veins\r\rAgain digest, descends it where \xc3\x95tis better\r    Silent to be than say; and then drops thence\r    Upon another\xc3\x95s blood in natural vase.\r\rThere one together with the other mingles,\r    One to be passive meant, the other active\r    By reason of the perfect place it springs from;\r\rAnd being conjoined, begins to operate,\r    Coagulating first, then vivifying\r    What for its matter it had made consistent.\r\rThe active virtue, being made a soul\r    As of a plant, (in so far different,\r    This on the way is, that arrived already,)\r\rThen works so much, that now it moves and feels\r    Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes\r    To organize the powers whose seed it is.\r\rNow, Son, dilates and now distends itself\r    The virtue from the generator\xc3\x95s heart,\r    Where nature is intent on all the members.\r\rBut how from animal it man becomes\r    Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point\r    Which made a wiser man than thou once err\r\rSo far, that in his doctrine separate\r    He made the soul from possible intellect,\r    For he no organ saw by this assumed.\r\rOpen thy breast unto the truth that\xc3\x95s coming,\r    And know that, just as soon as in the foetus\r    The articulation of the brain is perfect,\r\rThe primal Motor turns to it well pleased\r    At so great art of nature, and inspires\r    A spirit new with virtue all replete,\r\rWhich what it finds there active doth attract\r    Into its substance, and becomes one soul,\r    Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves.\r\rAnd that thou less may wonder at my word,\r    Behold the sun\xc3\x95s heat, which becometh wine,\r    Joined to the juice that from the vine distils.\r\rWhenever Lachesis has no more thread,\r    It separates from the flesh, and virtually\r    Bears with itself the human and divine;\r\rThe other faculties are voiceless all;\r    The memory, the intelligence, and the will\r    In action far more vigorous than before.\r\rWithout a pause it falleth of itself\r    In marvellous way on one shore or the other;\r    There of its roads it first is cognizant.\r\rSoon as the place there circumscribeth it,\r    The virtue informative rays round about,\r    As, and as much as, in the living members.\r\rAnd even as the air, when full of rain,\r    By alien rays that are therein reflected,\r    With divers colours shows itself adorned,\r\rSo there the neighbouring air doth shape itself\r    Into that form which doth impress upon it\r    Virtually the soul that has stood still.\r\rAnd then in manner of the little flame,\r    Which followeth the fire where\xc3\x95er it shifts,\r    After the spirit followeth its new form.\r\rSince afterwards it takes from this its semblance,\r    It is called shade; and thence it organizes\r    Thereafter every sense, even to the sight.\r\rThence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh;\r    Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs,\r    That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard.\r\rAccording as impress us our desires\r    And other affections, so the shade is shaped,\r    And this is cause of what thou wonderest at.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd now unto the last of all the circles\r    Had we arrived, and to the right hand turned,\r    And were attentive to another care.\r\rThere the embankment shoots forth flames of fire,\r    And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast\r    That drives them back, and from itself sequesters.\r\rHence we must needs go on the open side,\r    And one by one; and I did fear the fire\r    On this side, and on that the falling down.\r\rMy Leader said: \xc3\x92Along this place one ought\r    To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein,\r    Seeing that one so easily might err.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Summae Deus clementiae,\xc3\x93 in the bosom\r    Of the great burning chanted then I heard,\r    Which made me no less eager to turn round;\r\rAnd spirits saw I walking through the flame;\r    Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs\r    Apportioning my sight from time to time.\r\rAfter the close which to that hymn is made,\r    Aloud they shouted, \xc3\x92Virum non cognosco;\xc3\x93\r    Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.\r\rThis also ended, cried they: \xc3\x92To the wood\r    Diana ran, and drove forth Helice\r    Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison.\xc3\x93\r\rThen to their song returned they; then the wives\r    They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste.\r    As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.\r\rAnd I believe that them this mode suffices,\r    For all the time the fire is burning them;\r    With such care is it needful, and such food,\r\rThat the last wound of all should be closed up.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXVI\r\r\rWhile on the brink thus one before the other\r    We went upon our way, oft the good Master\r    Said: \xc3\x92Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee.\xc3\x93\r\rOn the right shoulder smote me now the sun,\r    That, raying out, already the whole west\r    Changed from its azure aspect into white.\r\rAnd with my shadow did I make the flame\r    Appear more red; and even to such a sign\r    Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed.\r\rThis was the cause that gave them a beginning\r    To speak of me; and to themselves began they\r    To say: \xc3\x92That seems not a factitious body!\xc3\x93\r\rThen towards me, as far as they could come,\r    Came certain of them, always with regard\r    Not to step forth where they would not be burned.\r\r\xc3\x92O thou who goest, not from being slower\r    But reverent perhaps, behind the others,\r    Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning.\r\rNor to me only is thine answer needful;\r    For all of these have greater thirst for it\r    Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian.\r\rTell us how is it that thou makest thyself\r    A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not\r    Entered as yet into the net of death.\xc3\x93\r\rThus one of them addressed me, and I straight\r    Should have revealed myself, were I not bent\r    On other novelty that then appeared.\r\rFor through the middle of the burning road\r    There came a people face to face with these,\r    Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.\r\rThere see I hastening upon either side\r    Each of the shades, and kissing one another\r    Without a pause, content with brief salute.\r\rThus in the middle of their brown battalions\r    Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another\r    Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune.\r\rNo sooner is the friendly greeting ended,\r    Or ever the first footstep passes onward,\r    Each one endeavours to outcry the other;\r\rThe new-come people: \xc3\x92Sodom and Gomorrah!\xc3\x93\r    The rest: \xc3\x92Into the cow Pasiphae enters,\r    So that the bull unto her lust may run!\xc3\x93\r\rThen as the cranes, that to Riphaean mountains\r    Might fly in part, and part towards the sands,\r    These of the frost, those of the sun avoidant,\r\rOne folk is going, and the other coming,\r    And weeping they return to their first songs,\r    And to the cry that most befitteth them;\r\rAnd close to me approached, even as before,\r    The very same who had entreated me,\r    Attent to listen in their countenance.\r\rI, who their inclination twice had seen,\r    Began: \xc3\x92O souls secure in the possession,\r    Whene\xc3\x95er it may be, of a state of peace,\r\rNeither unripe nor ripened have remained\r    My members upon earth, but here are with me\r    With their own blood and their articulations.\r\rI go up here to be no longer blind;\r    A Lady is above, who wins this grace,\r    Whereby the mortal through your world I bring.\r\rBut as your greatest longing satisfied\r    May soon become, so that the Heaven may house you\r    Which full of love is, and most amply spreads,\r\rTell me, that I again in books may write it,\r    Who are you, and what is that multitude\r    Which goes upon its way behind your backs?\xc3\x93\r\rNot otherwise with wonder is bewildered\r    The mountaineer, and staring round is dumb,\r    When rough and rustic to the town he goes,\r\rThan every shade became in its appearance;\r    But when they of their stupor were disburdened,\r    Which in high hearts is quickly quieted,\r\r\xc3\x92Blessed be thou, who of our border-lands,\xc3\x93\r    He recommenced who first had questioned us,\r    \xc3\x92Experience freightest for a better life.\r\rThe folk that comes not with us have offended\r    In that for which once Caesar, triumphing,\r    Heard himself called in contumely, \xc3\x94Queen.\xc3\x95\r\rTherefore they separate, exclaiming, \xc3\x94Sodom!\xc3\x95\r    Themselves reproving, even as thou hast heard,\r    And add unto their burning by their shame.\r\rOur own transgression was hermaphrodite;\r    But because we observed not human law,\r    Following like unto beasts our appetite,\r\rIn our opprobrium by us is read,\r    When we part company, the name of her\r    Who bestialized herself in bestial wood.\r\rNow knowest thou our acts, and what our crime was;\r    Wouldst thou perchance by name know who we are,\r    There is not time to tell, nor could I do it.\r\rThy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted;\r    I\xc3\x95m Guido Guinicelli, and now purge me,\r    Having repented ere the hour extreme.\xc3\x93\r\rThe same that in the sadness of Lycurgus\r    Two sons became, their mother re-beholding,\r    Such I became, but rise not to such height,\r\rThe moment I heard name himself the father\r    Of me and of my betters, who had ever\r    Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love;\r\rAnd without speech and hearing thoughtfully\r    For a long time I went, beholding him,\r    Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer.\r\rWhen I was fed with looking, utterly\r    Myself I offered ready for his service,\r    With affirmation that compels belief.\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Thou leavest footprints such\r    In me, from what I hear, and so distinct,\r    Lethe cannot efface them, nor make dim.\r\rBut if thy words just now the truth have sworn,\r    Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest\r    In word and look that dear thou holdest me?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92Those dulcet lays of yours\r    Which, long as shall endure our modern fashion,\r    Shall make for ever dear their very ink!\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O brother,\xc3\x93 said he, \xc3\x92he whom I point out,\xc3\x93\r    And here he pointed at a spirit in front,\r    \xc3\x92Was of the mother tongue a better smith.\r\rVerses of love and proses of romance,\r    He mastered all; and let the idiots talk,\r    Who think the Lemosin surpasses him.\r\rTo clamour more than truth they turn their faces,\r    And in this way establish their opinion,\r    Ere art or reason has by them been heard.\r\rThus many ancients with Guittone did,\r    From cry to cry still giving him applause,\r    Until the truth has conquered with most persons.\r\rNow, if thou hast such ample privilege\r    \xc3\x95Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister\r    Wherein is Christ the abbot of the college,\r\rTo him repeat for me a Paternoster,\r    So far as needful to us of this world,\r    Where power of sinning is no longer ours.\xc3\x93\r\rThen, to give place perchance to one behind,\r    Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire\r    As fish in water going to the bottom.\r\rI moved a little tow\xc3\x95rds him pointed out,\r    And said that to his name my own desire\r    An honourable place was making ready.\r\rHe of his own free will began to say:\r    \xc3\x94Tan m\xc3\x95 abellis vostre cortes deman,\r    Que jeu nom\xc3\x95 puesc ni vueill a vos cobrire;\r\rJeu sui Arnaut, que plor e vai chantan;\r    Consiros vei la passada folor,\r    E vei jauzen lo jorn qu\xc3\x95 esper denan.\r\rAra vus prec per aquella valor,\r    Que vus condus al som de la scalina,\r    Sovenga vus a temprar ma dolor.\xc3\x95*\r\rThen hid him in the fire that purifies them.\r\r* So pleases me your courteous demand,\r    I cannot and I will not hide me from you.\rI am Arnaut, who weep and singing go;\r    Contrite I see the folly of the past,\r    And joyous see the hoped-for day before me.\rTherefore do I implore you, by that power\r    Which guides you to the summit of the stairs,\r    Be mindful to assuage my suffering!\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXVII\r\r\rAs when he vibrates forth his earliest rays,\r    In regions where his Maker shed his blood,\r    (The Ebro falling under lofty Libra,\r\rAnd waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,)\r    So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing,\r    When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.\r\rOutside the flame he stood upon the verge,\r    And chanted forth, \xc3\x92Beati mundo corde,\xc3\x93\r    In voice by far more living than our own.\r\rThen: \xc3\x92No one farther goes, souls sanctified,\r    If first the fire bite not; within it enter,\r    And be not deaf unto the song beyond.\xc3\x93\r\rWhen we were close beside him thus he said;\r    Wherefore e\xc3\x95en such became I, when I heard him,\r    As he is who is put into the grave.\r\rUpon my clasped hands I straightened me,\r    Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling\r    The human bodies I had once seen burned.\r\rTowards me turned themselves my good Conductors,\r    And unto me Virgilius said: \xc3\x92My son,\r    Here may indeed be torment, but not death.\r\rRemember thee, remember! and if I\r    On Geryon have safely guided thee,\r    What shall I do now I am nearer God?\r\rBelieve for certain, shouldst thou stand a full\r    Millennium in the bosom of this flame,\r    It could not make thee bald a single hair.\r\rAnd if perchance thou think that I deceive thee,\r    Draw near to it, and put it to the proof\r    With thine own hands upon thy garment\xc3\x95s hem.\r\rNow lay aside, now lay aside all fear,\r    Turn hitherward, and onward come securely;\xc3\x93\r    And I still motionless, and \xc3\x95gainst my conscience!\r\rSeeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,\r    Somewhat disturbed he said: \xc3\x92Now look thou, Son,\r    \xc3\x95Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall.\xc3\x93\r\rAs at the name of Thisbe oped his lids\r    The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her,\r    What time the mulberry became vermilion,\r\rEven thus, my obduracy being softened,\r    I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name\r    That in my memory evermore is welling.\r\rWhereat he wagged his head, and said: \xc3\x92How now?\r    Shall we stay on this side?\xc3\x93 then smiled as one\r    Does at a child who\xc3\x95s vanquished by an apple.\r\rThen into the fire in front of me he entered,\r    Beseeching Statius to come after me,\r    Who a long way before divided us.\r\rWhen I was in it, into molten glass\r    I would have cast me to refresh myself,\r    So without measure was the burning there!\r\rAnd my sweet Father, to encourage me,\r    Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,\r    Saying: \xc3\x92Her eyes I seem to see already!\xc3\x93\r\rA voice, that on the other side was singing,\r    Directed us, and we, attent alone\r    On that, came forth where the ascent began.\r\r\xc3\x92Venite, benedicti Patris mei,\xc3\x93\r    Sounded within a splendour, which was there\r    Such it o\xc3\x95ercame me, and I could not look.\r\r\xc3\x92The sun departs,\xc3\x93 it added, \xc3\x92and night cometh;\r    Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,\r    So long as yet the west becomes not dark.\xc3\x93\r\rStraight forward through the rock the path ascended\r    In such a way that I cut off the rays\r    Before me of the sun, that now was low.\r\rAnd of few stairs we yet had made assay,\r    Ere by the vanished shadow the sun\xc3\x95s setting\r    Behind us we perceived, I and my Sages.\r\rAnd ere in all its parts immeasurable\r    The horizon of one aspect had become,\r    And Night her boundless dispensation held,\r\rEach of us of a stair had made his bed;\r    Because the nature of the mount took from us\r    The power of climbing, more than the delight.\r\rEven as in ruminating passive grow\r    The goats, who have been swift and venturesome\r    Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,\r\rHushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,\r    Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff\r    Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;\r\rAnd as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,\r    Passes the night beside his quiet flock,\r    Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,\r\rSuch at that hour were we, all three of us,\r    I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,\r    Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.\r\rLittle could there be seen of things without;\r    But through that little I beheld the stars\r    More luminous and larger than their wont.\r\rThus ruminating, and beholding these,\r    Sleep seized upon me,\xc3\x91sleep, that oftentimes\r    Before a deed is done has tidings of it.\r\rIt was the hour, I think, when from the East\r    First on the mountain Citherea beamed,\r    Who with the fire of love seems always burning;\r\rYouthful and beautiful in dreams methought\r    I saw a lady walking in a meadow,\r    Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:\r\r\xc3\x92Know whosoever may my name demand\r    That I am Leah, and go moving round\r    My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.\r\rTo please me at the mirror, here I deck me,\r    But never does my sister Rachel leave\r    Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.\r\rTo see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,\r    As I am to adorn me with my hands;\r    Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd now before the antelucan splendours\r    That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,\r    As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,\r\rThe darkness fled away on every side,\r    And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,\r    Seeing already the great Masters risen.\r\r\xc3\x92That apple sweet, which through so many branches\r    The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,\r    To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings.\xc3\x93\r\rSpeaking to me, Virgilius of such words\r    As these made use; and never were there guerdons\r    That could in pleasantness compare with these.\r\rSuch longing upon longing came upon me\r    To be above, that at each step thereafter\r    For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.\r\rWhen underneath us was the stairway all\r    Run o\xc3\x95er, and we were on the highest step,\r    Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,\r\rAnd said: \xc3\x92The temporal fire and the eternal,\r    Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come\r    Where of myself no farther I discern.\r\rBy intellect and art I here have brought thee;\r    Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth;\r    Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.\r\rBehold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;\r    Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs\r    Which of itself alone this land produces.\r\rUntil rejoicing come the beauteous eyes\r    Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,\r    Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.\r\rExpect no more or word or sign from me;\r    Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,\r    And error were it not to do its bidding;\r\rThee o\xc3\x95er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXVIII\r\r\rEager already to search in and round\r    The heavenly forest, dense and living-green,\r    Which tempered to the eyes the new-born day,\r\rWithouten more delay I left the bank,\r    Taking the level country slowly, slowly\r    Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance.\r\rA softly-breathing air, that no mutation\r    Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me\r    No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,\r\rWhereat the branches, lightly tremulous,\r    Did all of them bow downward toward that side\r    Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain;\r\rYet not from their upright direction swayed,\r    So that the little birds upon their tops\r    Should leave the practice of each art of theirs;\r\rBut with full ravishment the hours of prime,\r    Singing, received they in the midst of leaves,\r    That ever bore a burden to their rhymes,\r\rSuch as from branch to branch goes gathering on\r    Through the pine forest on the shore of Chiassi,\r    When Eolus unlooses the Sirocco.\r\rAlready my slow steps had carried me\r    Into the ancient wood so far, that I\r    Could not perceive where I had entered it.\r\rAnd lo! my further course a stream cut off,\r    Which tow\xc3\x95rd the left hand with its little waves\r    Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang.\r\rAll waters that on earth most limpid are\r    Would seem to have within themselves some mixture\r    Compared with that which nothing doth conceal,\r\rAlthough it moves on with a brown, brown current\r    Under the shade perpetual, that never\r    Ray of the sun lets in, nor of the moon.\r\rWith feet I stayed, and with mine eyes I passed\r    Beyond the rivulet, to look upon\r    The great variety of the fresh may.\r\rAnd there appeared to me (even as appears\r    Suddenly something that doth turn aside\r    Through very wonder every other thought)\r\rA lady all alone, who went along\r    Singing and culling floweret after floweret,\r    With which her pathway was all painted over.\r\r\xc3\x92Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love\r    Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,\r    Which the heart\xc3\x95s witnesses are wont to be,\r\rMay the desire come unto thee to draw\r    Near to this river\xc3\x95s bank,\xc3\x93 I said to her,\r    \xc3\x92So much that I might hear what thou art singing.\r\rThou makest me remember where and what\r    Proserpina that moment was when lost\r    Her mother her, and she herself the Spring.\xc3\x93\r\rAs turns herself, with feet together pressed\r    And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,\r    And hardly puts one foot before the other,\r\rOn the vermilion and the yellow flowerets\r    She turned towards me, not in other wise\r    Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;\r\rAnd my entreaties made to be content,\r    So near approaching, that the dulcet sound\r    Came unto me together with its meaning\r\rAs soon as she was where the grasses are.\r    Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,\r    To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.\r\rI do not think there shone so great a light\r    Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed\r    By her own son, beyond his usual custom!\r\rErect upon the other bank she smiled,\r    Bearing full many colours in her hands,\r    Which that high land produces without seed.\r\rApart three paces did the river make us;\r    But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,\r    (A curb still to all human arrogance,)\r\rMore hatred from Leander did not suffer\r    For rolling between Sestos and Abydos,\r    Than that from me, because it oped not then.\r\r\xc3\x92Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,\xc3\x93\r    Began she, \xc3\x92peradventure, in this place\r    Elect to human nature for its nest,\r\rSome apprehension keeps you marvelling;\r    But the psalm \xc3\x94Delectasti\xc3\x95 giveth light\r    Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.\r\rAnd thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me,\r    Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready\r    To all thy questionings, as far as needful.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92The water,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92and the forest\xc3\x95s sound,\r    Are combating within me my new faith\r    In something which I heard opposed to this.\xc3\x93\r\rWhence she: \xc3\x92I will relate how from its cause\r    Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder,\r    And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee.\r\rThe Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting,\r    Created man good, and this goodly place\r    Gave him as hansel of eternal peace.\r\rBy his default short while he sojourned here;\r    By his default to weeping and to toil\r    He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.\r\rThat the disturbance which below is made\r    By exhalations of the land and water,\r    (Which far as may be follow after heat,)\r\rMight not upon mankind wage any war,\r    This mount ascended tow\xc3\x95rds the heaven so high,\r    And is exempt, from there where it is locked.\r\rNow since the universal atmosphere\r    Turns in a circuit with the primal motion\r    Unless the circle is broken on some side,\r\rUpon this height, that all is disengaged\r    In living ether, doth this motion strike\r    And make the forest sound, for it is dense;\r\rAnd so much power the stricken plant possesses\r    That with its virtue it impregns the air,\r    And this, revolving, scatters it around;\r\rAnd yonder earth, according as \xc3\x95tis worthy\r    In self or in its clime, conceives and bears\r    Of divers qualities the divers trees;\r\rIt should not seem a marvel then on earth,\r    This being heard, whenever any plant\r    Without seed manifest there taketh root.\r\rAnd thou must know, this holy table-land\r    In which thou art is full of every seed,\r    And fruit has in it never gathered there.\r\rThe water which thou seest springs not from vein\r    Restored by vapour that the cold condenses,\r    Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;\r\rBut issues from a fountain safe and certain,\r    Which by the will of God as much regains\r    As it discharges, open on two sides.\r\rUpon this side with virtue it descends,\r    Which takes away all memory of sin;\r    On that, of every good deed done restores it.\r\rHere Lethe, as upon the other side\r    Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not\r    If first on either side it be not tasted.\r\rThis every other savour doth transcend;\r    And notwithstanding slaked so far may be\r    Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,\r\rI\xc3\x95ll give thee a corollary still in grace,\r    Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear\r    If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.\r\rThose who in ancient times have feigned in song\r    The Age of Gold and its felicity,\r    Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.\r\rHere was the human race in innocence;\r    Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;\r    This is the nectar of which each one speaks.\xc3\x93\r\rThen backward did I turn me wholly round\r    Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile\r    They had been listening to these closing words;\r\rThen to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXIX\r\r\rSinging like unto an enamoured lady\r    She, with the ending of her words, continued:\r    \xc3\x92Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone\r    Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous\r    One to avoid and one to see the sun,\r\rShe then against the stream moved onward, going\r    Along the bank, and I abreast of her,\r    Her little steps with little steps attending.\r\rBetween her steps and mine were not a hundred,\r    When equally the margins gave a turn,\r    In such a way, that to the East I faced.\r\rNor even thus our way continued far\r    Before the lady wholly turned herself\r    Unto me, saying, \xc3\x92Brother, look and listen!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd lo! a sudden lustre ran across\r    On every side athwart the spacious forest,\r    Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.\r\rBut since the lightning ceases as it comes,\r    And that continuing brightened more and more,\r    Within my thought I said, \xc3\x92What thing is this?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd a delicious melody there ran\r    Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal\r    Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;\r\rFor there where earth and heaven obedient were,\r    The woman only, and but just created,\r    Could not endure to stay \xc3\x95neath any veil;\r\rUnderneath which had she devoutly stayed,\r    I sooner should have tasted those delights\r    Ineffable, and for a longer time.\r\rWhile \xc3\x95mid such manifold first-fruits I walked\r    Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,\r    And still solicitous of more delights,\r\rIn front of us like an enkindled fire\r    Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,\r    And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.\r\rO Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,\r    Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,\r    The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!\r\rNow Helicon must needs pour forth for me,\r    And with her choir Urania must assist me,\r    To put in verse things difficult to think.\r\rA little farther on, seven trees of gold\r    In semblance the long space still intervening\r    Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;\r\rBut when I had approached so near to them\r    The common object, which the sense deceives,\r    Lost not by distance any of its marks,\r\rThe faculty that lends discourse to reason\r    Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,\r    And in the voices of the song \xc3\x92Hosanna!\xc3\x93\r\rAbove them flamed the harness beautiful,\r    Far brighter than the moon in the serene\r    Of midnight, at the middle of her month.\r\rI turned me round, with admiration filled,\r    To good Virgilius, and he answered me\r    With visage no less full of wonderment.\r\rThen back I turned my face to those high things,\r    Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,\r    They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.\r\rThe lady chid me: \xc3\x92Why dost thou burn only\r    So with affection for the living lights,\r    And dost not look at what comes after them?\xc3\x93\r\rThen saw I people, as behind their leaders,\r    Coming behind them, garmented in white,\r    And such a whiteness never was on earth.\r\rThe water on my left flank was resplendent,\r    And back to me reflected my left side,\r    E\xc3\x95en as a mirror, if I looked therein.\r\rWhen I upon my margin had such post\r    That nothing but the stream divided us,\r    Better to see I gave my steps repose;\r\rAnd I beheld the flamelets onward go,\r    Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,\r    And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,\r\rSo that it overhead remained distinct\r    With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours\r    Whence the sun\xc3\x95s bow is made, and Delia\xc3\x95s girdle.\r\rThese standards to the rearward longer were\r    Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,\r    Ten paces were the outermost apart.\r\rUnder so fair a heaven as I describe\r    The four and twenty Elders, two by two,\r    Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.\r\rThey all of them were singing: \xc3\x92Blessed thou\r    Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed\r    For evermore shall be thy loveliness.\xc3\x93\r\rAfter the flowers and other tender grasses\r    In front of me upon the other margin\r    Were disencumbered of that race elect,\r\rEven as in heaven star followeth after star,\r    There came close after them four animals,\r    Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.\r\rPlumed with six wings was every one of them,\r    The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus\r    If they were living would be such as these.\r\rReader! to trace their forms no more I waste\r    My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,\r    That I in this cannot be prodigal.\r\rBut read Ezekiel, who depicteth them\r    As he beheld them from the region cold\r    Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;\r\rAnd such as thou shalt find them in his pages,\r    Such were they here; saving that in their plumage\r    John is with me, and differeth from him.\r\rThe interval between these four contained\r    A chariot triumphal on two wheels,\r    Which by a Griffin\xc3\x95s neck came drawn along;\r\rAnd upward he extended both his wings\r    Between the middle list and three and three,\r    So that he injured none by cleaving it.\r\rSo high they rose that they were lost to sight;\r    His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,\r    And white the others with vermilion mingled.\r\rNot only Rome with no such splendid car\r    E\xc3\x95er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,\r    But poor to it that of the Sun would be,\xc3\x91\r\rThat of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up\r    At the importunate orison of Earth,\r    When Jove was so mysteriously just.\r\rThree maidens at the right wheel in a circle\r    Came onward dancing; one so very red\r    That in the fire she hardly had been noted.\r\rThe second was as if her flesh and bones\r    Had all been fashioned out of emerald;\r    The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.\r\rAnd now they seemed conducted by the white,\r    Now by the red, and from the song of her\r    The others took their step, or slow or swift.\r\rUpon the left hand four made holiday\r    Vested in purple, following the measure\r    Of one of them with three eyes m her head.\r\rIn rear of all the group here treated of\r    Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,\r    But like in gait, each dignified and grave.\r\rOne showed himself as one of the disciples\r    Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature\r    Made for the animals she holds most dear;\r\rContrary care the other manifested,\r    With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused\r    Terror to me on this side of the river.\r\rThereafter four I saw of humble aspect,\r    And behind all an aged man alone\r    Walking in sleep with countenance acute.\r\rAnd like the foremost company these seven\r    Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce\r    No garland round about the head they wore,\r\rBut of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;\r    At little distance would the sight have sworn\r    That all were in a flame above their brows.\r\rAnd when the car was opposite to me\r    Thunder was heard; and all that folk august\r    Seemed to have further progress interdicted,\r\rThere with the vanward ensigns standing still.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXX\r\r\rWhen the Septentrion of the highest heaven\r    (Which never either setting knew or rising,\r    Nor veil of other cloud than that of sin,\r\rAnd which made every one therein aware\r    Of his own duty, as the lower makes\r    Whoever turns the helm to come to port)\r\rMotionless halted, the veracious people,\r    That came at first between it and the Griffin,\r    Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace.\r\rAnd one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned,\r    Singing, \xc3\x92Veni, sponsa, de Libano\xc3\x93\r    Shouted three times, and all the others after.\r\rEven as the Blessed at the final summons\r    Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern,\r    Uplifting light the reinvested flesh,\r\rSo upon that celestial chariot\r    A hundred rose \xc3\x94ad vocem tanti senis,\xc3\x95\r    Ministers and messengers of life eternal.\r\rThey all were saying, \xc3\x92Benedictus qui venis,\xc3\x93\r    And, scattering flowers above and round about,\r    \xc3\x92Manibus o date lilia plenis.\xc3\x93\r\rEre now have I beheld, as day began,\r    The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,\r    And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;\r\rAnd the sun\xc3\x95s face, uprising, overshadowed\r    So that by tempering influence of vapours\r    For a long interval the eye sustained it;\r\rThus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers\r    Which from those hands angelical ascended,\r    And downward fell again inside and out,\r\rOver her snow-white veil with olive cinct\r    Appeared a lady under a green mantle,\r    Vested in colour of the living flame.\r\rAnd my own spirit, that already now\r    So long a time had been, that in her presence\r    Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,\r\rWithout more knowledge having by mine eyes,\r    Through occult virtue that from her proceeded\r    Of ancient love the mighty influence felt.\r\rAs soon as on my vision smote the power\r    Sublime, that had already pierced me through\r    Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,\r\rTo the left hand I turned with that reliance\r    With which the little child runs to his mother,\r    When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,\r\rTo say unto Virgilius: \xc3\x92Not a drachm\r    Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;\r    I know the traces of the ancient flame.\xc3\x93\r\rBut us Virgilius of himself deprived\r    Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,\r    Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:\r\rNor whatsoever lost the ancient mother\r    Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,\r    That weeping they should not again be darkened.\r\r\xc3\x92Dante, because Virgilius has departed\r    Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;\r    For by another sword thou need\xc3\x95st must weep.\xc3\x93\r\rE\xc3\x95en as an admiral, who on poop and prow\r    Comes to behold the people that are working\r    In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,\r\rUpon the left hand border of the car,\r    When at the sound I turned of my own name,\r    Which of necessity is here recorded,\r\rI saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared\r    Veiled underneath the angelic festival,\r    Direct her eyes to me across the river.\r\rAlthough the veil, that from her head descended,\r    Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,\r    Did not permit her to appear distinctly,\r\rIn attitude still royally majestic\r    Continued she, like unto one who speaks,\r    And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:\r\r\xc3\x92Look at me well; in sooth I\xc3\x95m Beatrice!\r    How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?\r    Didst thou not know that man is happy here?\xc3\x93\r\rMine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,\r    But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,\r    So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.\r\rAs to the son the mother seems superb,\r    So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter\r    Tasteth the savour of severe compassion.\r\rSilent became she, and the Angels sang\r    Suddenly, \xc3\x92In te, Domine, speravi:\xc3\x93\r    But beyond \xc3\x94pedes meos\xc3\x95 did not pass.\r\rEven as the snow among the living rafters\r    Upon the back of Italy congeals,\r    Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,\r\rAnd then, dissolving, trickles through itself\r    Whene\xc3\x95er the land that loses shadow breathes,\r    So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;\r\rE\xc3\x95en thus was I without a tear or sigh,\r    Before the song of those who sing for ever\r    After the music of the eternal spheres.\r\rBut when I heard in their sweet melodies\r    Compassion for me, more than had they said,\r    \xc3\x92O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?\xc3\x93\r\rThe ice, that was about my heart congealed,\r    To air and water changed, and in my anguish\r    Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.\r\rShe, on the right-hand border of the car\r    Still firmly standing, to those holy beings\r    Thus her discourse directed afterwards:\r\r\xc3\x92Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,\r    So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you\r    One step the ages make upon their path;\r\rTherefore my answer is with greater care,\r    That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,\r    So that the sin and dole be of one measure.\r\rNot only by the work of those great wheels,\r    That destine every seed unto some end,\r    According as the stars are in conjunction,\r\rBut by the largess of celestial graces,\r    Which have such lofty vapours for their rain\r    That near to them our sight approaches not,\r\rSuch had this man become in his new life\r    Potentially, that every righteous habit\r    Would have made admirable proof in him;\r\rBut so much more malignant and more savage\r    Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,\r    The more good earthly vigour it possesses.\r\rSome time did I sustain him with my look;\r    Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,\r    I led him with me turned in the right way.\r\rAs soon as ever of my second age\r    I was upon the threshold and changed life,\r    Himself from me he took and gave to others.\r\rWhen from the flesh to spirit I ascended,\r    And beauty and virtue were in me increased,\r    I was to him less dear and less delightful;\r\rAnd into ways untrue he turned his steps,\r    Pursuing the false images of good,\r    That never any promises fulfil;\r\rNor prayer for inspiration me availed,\r    By means of which in dreams and otherwise\r    I called him back, so little did he heed them.\r\rSo low he fell, that all appliances\r    For his salvation were already short,\r    Save showing him the people of perdition.\r\rFor this I visited the gates of death,\r    And unto him, who so far up has led him,\r    My intercessions were with weeping borne.\r\rGod\xc3\x95s lofty fiat would be violated,\r    If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands\r    Should tasted be, withouten any scot\r\rOf penitence, that gushes forth in tears.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXXI\r\r\r\xc3\x92O thou who art beyond the sacred river,\xc3\x93\r    Turning to me the point of her discourse,\r    That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,\r\rShe recommenced, continuing without pause,\r    \xc3\x92Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,\r    Thy own confession needs must be conjoined.\xc3\x93\r\rMy faculties were in so great confusion,\r    That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct\r    Than by its organs it was set at large.\r\rAwhile she waited; then she said: \xc3\x92What thinkest?\r    Answer me; for the mournful memories\r    In thee not yet are by the waters injured.\xc3\x93\r\rConfusion and dismay together mingled\r    Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight\r    Was needful to the understanding of it.\r\rEven as a cross-bow breaks, when \xc3\x95tis discharged\r    Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,\r    And with less force the arrow hits the mark,\r\rSo I gave way beneath that heavy burden,\r    Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,\r    And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.\r\rWhence she to me: \xc3\x92In those desires of mine\r    Which led thee to the loving of that good,\r    Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,\r\rWhat trenches lying traverse or what chains\r    Didst thou discover, that of passing onward\r    Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?\r\rAnd what allurements or what vantages\r    Upon the forehead of the others showed,\r    That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?\xc3\x93\r\rAfter the heaving of a bitter sigh,\r    Hardly had I the voice to make response,\r    And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.\r\rWeeping I said: \xc3\x92The things that present were\r    With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,\r    Soon as your countenance concealed itself.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd she: \xc3\x92Shouldst thou be silent, or deny\r    What thou confessest, not less manifest\r    Would be thy fault, by such a Judge \xc3\x95tis known.\r\rBut when from one\xc3\x95s own cheeks comes bursting forth\r    The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal\r    Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.\r\rBut still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame\r    For thy transgression, and another time\r    Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,\r\rCast down the seed of weeping and attend;\r    So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way\r    My buried flesh should have directed thee.\r\rNever to thee presented art or nature\r    Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein\r    I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.\r\rAnd if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee\r    By reason of my death, what mortal thing\r    Should then have drawn thee into its desire?\r\rThou oughtest verily at the first shaft\r    Of things fallacious to have risen up\r    To follow me, who was no longer such.\r\rThou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward\r    To wait for further blows, or little girl,\r    Or other vanity of such brief use.\r\rThe callow birdlet waits for two or three,\r    But to the eyes of those already fledged,\r    In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as children silent in their shame\r    Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,\r    And conscious of their fault, and penitent;\r\rSo was I standing; and she said: \xc3\x92If thou\r    In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard\r    And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing.\xc3\x93\r\rWith less resistance is a robust holm\r    Uprooted, either by a native wind\r    Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,\r\rThan I upraised at her command my chin;\r    And when she by the beard the face demanded,\r    Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.\r\rAnd as my countenance was lifted up,\r    Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful\r    Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;\r\rAnd, still but little reassured, mine eyes\r    Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,\r    That is one person only in two natures.\r\rBeneath her veil, beyond the margent green,\r    She seemed to me far more her ancient self\r    To excel, than others here, when she was here.\r\rSo pricked me then the thorn of penitence,\r    That of all other things the one which turned me\r    Most to its love became the most my foe.\r\rSuch self-conviction stung me at the heart\r    O\xc3\x95erpowered I fell, and what I then became\r    She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.\r\rThen, when the heart restored my outward sense,\r    The lady I had found alone, above me\r    I saw, and she was saying, \xc3\x92Hold me, hold me.\xc3\x93\r\rUp to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,\r    And, dragging me behind her, she was moving\r    Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.\r\rWhen I was near unto the blessed shore,\r    \xc3\x92Asperges me,\xc3\x93 I heard so sweetly sung,\r    Remember it I cannot, much less write it.\r\rThe beautiful lady opened wide her arms,\r    Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,\r    Where I was forced to swallow of the water.\r\rThen forth she drew me, and all dripping brought\r    Into the dance of the four beautiful,\r    And each one with her arm did cover me.\r\r\xc3\x94We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;\r    Ere Beatrice descended to the world,\r    We as her handmaids were appointed her.\r\rWe\xc3\x95ll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant\r    Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine\r    The three beyond, who more profoundly look.\xc3\x95\r\rThus singing they began; and afterwards\r    Unto the Griffin\xc3\x95s breast they led me with them,\r    Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.\r\r\xc3\x92See that thou dost not spare thine eyes,\xc3\x93 they said;\r    \xc3\x92Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,\r    Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons.\xc3\x93\r\rA thousand longings, hotter than the flame,\r    Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,\r    That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.\r\rAs in a glass the sun, not otherwise\r    Within them was the twofold monster shining,\r    Now with the one, now with the other nature.\r\rThink, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,\r    When I beheld the thing itself stand still,\r    And in its image it transformed itself.\r\rWhile with amazement filled and jubilant,\r    My soul was tasting of the food, that while\r    It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,\r\rThemselves revealing of the highest rank\r    In bearing, did the other three advance,\r    Singing to their angelic saraband.\r\r\xc3\x92Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,\xc3\x93\r    Such was their song, \xc3\x92unto thy faithful one,\r    Who has to see thee ta\xc3\x95en so many steps.\r\rIn grace do us the grace that thou unveil\r    Thy face to him, so that he may discern\r    The second beauty which thou dost conceal.\xc3\x93\r\rO splendour of the living light eternal!\r    Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus\r    Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,\r\rHe would not seem to have his mind encumbered\r    Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,\r    Where the harmonious heaven o\xc3\x95ershadowed thee,\r\rWhen in the open air thou didst unveil?\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXXII\r\r\rSo steadfast and attentive were mine eyes\r    In satisfying their decennial thirst,\r    That all my other senses were extinct,\r\rAnd upon this side and on that they had\r    Walls of indifference, so the holy smile\r    Drew them unto itself with the old net\r\rWhen forcibly my sight was turned away\r    Towards my left hand by those goddesses,\r    Because I heard from them a \xc3\x92Too intently!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd that condition of the sight which is\r    In eyes but lately smitten by the sun\r    Bereft me of my vision some short while;\r\rBut to the less when sight re-shaped itself,\r    I say the less in reference to the greater\r    Splendour from which perforce I had withdrawn,\r\rI saw upon its right wing wheeled about\r    The glorious host returning with the sun\r    And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.\r\rAs underneath its shields, to save itself,\r    A squadron turns, and with its banner wheels,\r    Before the whole thereof can change its front,\r\rThat soldiery of the celestial kingdom\r    Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us\r    Before the chariot had turned its pole.\r\rThen to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,\r    And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,\r    But so that not a feather of him fluttered.\r\rThe lady fair who drew me through the ford\r    Followed with Statius and myself the wheel\r    Which made its orbit with the lesser arc.\r\rSo passing through the lofty forest, vacant\r    By fault of her who in the serpent trusted,\r    Angelic music made our steps keep time.\r\rPerchance as great a space had in three flights\r    An arrow loosened from the string o\xc3\x95erpassed,\r    As we had moved when Beatrice descended.\r\rI heard them murmur altogether, \xc3\x92Adam!\xc3\x93\r    Then circled they about a tree despoiled\r    Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.\r\rIts tresses, which so much the more dilate\r    As higher they ascend, had been by Indians\r    Among their forests marvelled at for height.\r\r\xc3\x92Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not\r    Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,\r    Since appetite by this was turned to evil.\xc3\x93\r\rAfter this fashion round the tree robust\r    The others shouted; and the twofold creature:\r    \xc3\x92Thus is preserved the seed of all the just.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd turning to the pole which he had dragged,\r    He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,\r    And what was of it unto it left bound.\r\rIn the same manner as our trees (when downward\r    Falls the great light, with that together mingled\r    Which after the celestial Lasca shines)\r\rBegin to swell, and then renew themselves,\r    Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun\r    Harness his steeds beneath another star:\r\rLess than of rose and more than violet\r    A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree\r    That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.\r\rI never heard, nor here below is sung,\r    The hymn which afterward that people sang,\r    Nor did I bear the melody throughout.\r\rHad I the power to paint how fell asleep\r    Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,\r    Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,\r\rEven as a painter who from model paints\r    I would portray how I was lulled asleep;\r    He may, who well can picture drowsihood.\r\rTherefore I pass to what time I awoke,\r    And say a splendour rent from me the veil\r    Of slumber, and a calling: \xc3\x92Rise, what dost thou?\xc3\x93\r\rAs to behold the apple-tree in blossom\r    Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,\r    And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,\r\rPeter and John and James conducted were,\r    And, overcome, recovered at the word\r    By which still greater slumbers have been broken,\r\rAnd saw their school diminished by the loss\r    Not only of Elias, but of Moses,\r    And the apparel of their Master changed;\r\rSo I revived, and saw that piteous one\r    Above me standing, who had been conductress\r    Aforetime of my steps beside the river,\r\rAnd all in doubt I said, \xc3\x92Where\xc3\x95s Beatrice?\xc3\x93\r    And she: \xc3\x92Behold her seated underneath\r    The leafage new, upon the root of it.\r\rBehold the company that circles her;\r    The rest behind the Griffin are ascending\r    With more melodious song, and more profound.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd if her speech were more diffuse I know not,\r    Because already in my sight was she\r    Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.\r\rAlone she sat upon the very earth,\r    Left there as guardian of the chariot\r    Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.\r\rEncircling her, a cloister made themselves\r    The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands\r    Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.\r\r\xc3\x92Short while shalt thou be here a forester,\r    And thou shalt be with me for evermore\r    A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.\r\rTherefore, for that world\xc3\x95s good which liveth ill,\r    Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,\r    Having returned to earth, take heed thou write.\xc3\x93\r\rThus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet\r    Of her commandments all devoted was,\r    My mind and eyes directed where she willed.\r\rNever descended with so swift a motion\r    Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining\r    From out the region which is most remote,\r\rAs I beheld the bird of Jove descend\r    Down through the tree, rending away the bark,\r    As well as blossoms and the foliage new,\r\rAnd he with all his might the chariot smote,\r    Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest\r    Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.\r\rThereafter saw I leap into the body\r    Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,\r    That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.\r\rBut for his hideous sins upbraiding him,\r    My Lady put him to as swift a flight\r    As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.\r\rThen by the way that it before had come,\r    Into the chariot\xc3\x95s chest I saw the Eagle\r    Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.\r\rAnd such as issues from a heart that mourns,\r    A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:\r    \xc3\x92My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!\xc3\x93\r\rMethought, then, that the earth did yawn between\r    Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,\r    Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,\r\rAnd as a wasp that draweth back its sting,\r    Drawing unto himself his tail malign,\r    Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.\r\rThat which remained behind, even as with grass\r    A fertile region, with the feathers, offered\r    Perhaps with pure intention and benign,\r\rReclothed itself, and with them were reclothed\r    The pole and both the wheels so speedily,\r    A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.\r\rTransfigured thus the holy edifice\r    Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,\r    Three on the pole and one at either corner.\r\rThe first were horned like oxen; but the four\r    Had but a single horn upon the forehead;\r    A monster such had never yet been seen!\r\rFirm as a rock upon a mountain high,\r    Seated upon it, there appeared to me\r    A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,\r\rAnd, as if not to have her taken from him,\r    Upright beside her I beheld a giant;\r    And ever and anon they kissed each other.\r\rBut because she her wanton, roving eye\r    Turned upon me, her angry paramour\r    Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.\r\rThen full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,\r    He loosed the monster, and across the forest\r    Dragged it so far, he made of that alone\r\rA shield unto the whore and the strange beast.\r\r\r\r\rPurgatorio: Canto XXXIII\r\r\r\xc3\x92Deus venerunt gentes,\xc3\x93 alternating\r    Now three, now four, melodious psalmody\r    The maidens in the midst of tears began;\r\rAnd Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,\r    Listened to them with such a countenance,\r    That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.\r\rBut when the other virgins place had given\r    For her to speak, uprisen to her feet\r    With colour as of fire, she made response:\r\r\xc3\x92\xc3\x94Modicum, et non videbitis me;\r    Et iterum,\xc3\x95 my sisters predilect,\r    \xc3\x94Modicum, et vos videbitis me.\xc3\x95\xc3\x93\r\rThen all the seven in front of her she placed;\r    And after her, by beckoning only, moved\r    Me and the lady and the sage who stayed.\r\rSo she moved onward; and I do not think\r    That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,\r    When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote,\r\rAnd with a tranquil aspect, \xc3\x92Come more quickly,\xc3\x93\r    To me she said, \xc3\x92that, if I speak with thee,\r    To listen to me thou mayst be well placed.\xc3\x93\r\rAs soon as I was with her as I should be,\r    She said to me: \xc3\x92Why, brother, dost thou not\r    Venture to question now, in coming with me?\xc3\x93\r\rAs unto those who are too reverential,\r    Speaking in presence of superiors,\r    Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,\r\rIt me befell, that without perfect sound\r    Began I: \xc3\x92My necessity, Madonna,\r    You know, and that which thereunto is good.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd she to me: \xc3\x92Of fear and bashfulness\r    Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,\r    So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.\r\rKnow that the vessel which the serpent broke\r    Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty\r    Think that God\xc3\x95s vengeance does not fear a sop.\r\rWithout an heir shall not for ever be\r    The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,\r    Whence it became a monster, then a prey;\r\rFor verily I see, and hence narrate it,\r    The stars already near to bring the time,\r    From every hindrance safe, and every bar,\r\rWithin which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,\r    One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman\r    And that same giant who is sinning with her.\r\rAnd peradventure my dark utterance,\r    Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,\r    Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;\r\rBut soon the facts shall be the Naiades\r    Who shall this difficult enigma solve,\r    Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.\r\rNote thou; and even as by me are uttered\r    These words, so teach them unto those who live\r    That life which is a running unto death;\r\rAnd bear in mind, whene\xc3\x95er thou writest them,\r    Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,\r    That twice already has been pillaged here.\r\rWhoever pillages or shatters it,\r    With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,\r    Who made it holy for his use alone.\r\rFor biting that, in pain and in desire\r    Five thousand years and more the first-born soul\r    Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.\r\rThy genius slumbers, if it deem it not\r    For special reason so pre-eminent\r    In height, and so inverted in its summit.\r\rAnd if thy vain imaginings had not been\r    Water of Elsa round about thy mind,\r    And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,\r\rThou by so many circumstances only\r    The justice of the interdict of God\r    Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.\r\rBut since I see thee in thine intellect\r    Converted into stone and stained with sin,\r    So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,\r\rI will too, if not written, at least painted,\r    Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason\r    That cinct with palm the pilgrim\xc3\x95s staff is borne.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92As by a signet is the wax\r    Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,\r    My brain is now imprinted by yourself.\r\rBut wherefore so beyond my power of sight\r    Soars your desirable discourse, that aye\r    The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92That thou mayst recognize,\xc3\x93 she said, \xc3\x92the school\r    Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far\r    Its doctrine follows after my discourse,\r\rAnd mayst behold your path from the divine\r    Distant as far as separated is\r    From earth the heaven that highest hastens on.\xc3\x93\r\rWhence her I answered: \xc3\x92I do not remember\r    That ever I estranged myself from you,\r    Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92And if thou art not able to remember,\xc3\x93\r    Smiling she answered, \xc3\x92recollect thee now\r    That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;\r\rAnd if from smoke a fire may be inferred,\r    Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates\r    Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.\r\rTruly from this time forward shall my words\r    Be naked, so far as it is befitting\r    To lay them open unto thy rude gaze.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd more coruscant and with slower steps\r    The sun was holding the meridian circle,\r    Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there\r\rWhen halted (as he cometh to a halt,\r    Who goes before a squadron as its escort,\r    If something new he find upon his way)\r\rThe ladies seven at a dark shadow\xc3\x95s edge,\r    Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,\r    The Alp upon its frigid border wears.\r\rIn front of them the Tigris and Euphrates\r    Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,\r    And slowly part, like friends, from one another.\r\r\xc3\x92O light, O glory of the human race!\r    What stream is this which here unfolds itself\r    From out one source, and from itself withdraws?\xc3\x93\r\rFor such a prayer, \xc3\x95twas said unto me, \xc3\x92Pray\r    Matilda that she tell thee;\xc3\x93 and here answered,\r    As one does who doth free himself from blame,\r\rThe beautiful lady: \xc3\x92This and other things\r    Were told to him by me; and sure I am\r    The water of Lethe has not hid them from him.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd Beatrice: \xc3\x92Perhaps a greater care,\r    Which oftentimes our memory takes away,\r    Has made the vision of his mind obscure.\r\rBut Eunoe behold, that yonder rises;\r    Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,\r    Revive again the half-dead virtue in him.\xc3\x93\r\rLike gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,\r    But makes its own will of another\xc3\x95s will\r    As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,\r\rEven so, when she had taken hold of me,\r    The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius\r    Said, in her womanly manner, \xc3\x92Come with him.\xc3\x93\r\rIf, Reader, I possessed a longer space\r    For writing it, I yet would sing in part\r    Of the sweet draught that ne\xc3\x95er would satiate me;\r\rBut inasmuch as full are all the leaves\r    Made ready for this second canticle,\r    The curb of art no farther lets me go.\r\rFrom the most holy water I returned\r    Regenerate, in the manner of new trees\r    That are renewed with a new foliage,\r\rPure and disposed to mount unto the stars.\r\r\r\r\rPARADISO\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto I\r\r\rThe glory of Him who moveth everything\r    Doth penetrate the universe, and shine\r    In one part more and in another less.\r\rWithin that heaven which most his light receives\r    Was I, and things beheld which to repeat\r    Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;\r\rBecause in drawing near to its desire\r    Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,\r    That after it the memory cannot go.\r\rTruly whatever of the holy realm\r    I had the power to treasure in my mind\r    Shall now become the subject of my song.\r\rO good Apollo, for this last emprise\r    Make of me such a vessel of thy power\r    As giving the beloved laurel asks!\r\rOne summit of Parnassus hitherto\r    Has been enough for me, but now with both\r    I needs must enter the arena left.\r\rEnter into my bosom, thou, and breathe\r    As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw\r    Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.\r\rO power divine, lend\xc3\x95st thou thyself to me\r    So that the shadow of the blessed realm\r    Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,\r\rThou\xc3\x95lt see me come unto thy darling tree,\r    And crown myself thereafter with those leaves\r    Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.\r\rSo seldom, Father, do we gather them\r    For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,\r    (The fault and shame of human inclinations,)\r\rThat the Peneian foliage should bring forth\r    Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,\r    When any one it makes to thirst for it.\r\rA little spark is followed by great flame;\r    Perchance with better voices after me\r    Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!\r\rTo mortal men by passages diverse\r    Uprises the world\xc3\x95s lamp; but by that one\r    Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,\r\rWith better course and with a better star\r    Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax\r    Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.\r\rAlmost that passage had made morning there\r    And evening here, and there was wholly white\r    That hemisphere, and black the other part,\r\rWhen Beatrice towards the left-hand side\r    I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;\r    Never did eagle fasten so upon it!\r\rAnd even as a second ray is wont\r    To issue from the first and reascend,\r    Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,\r\rThus of her action, through the eyes infused\r    In my imagination, mine I made,\r    And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.\r\rThere much is lawful which is here unlawful\r    Unto our powers, by virtue of the place\r    Made for the human species as its own.\r\rNot long I bore it, nor so little while\r    But I beheld it sparkle round about\r    Like iron that comes molten from the fire;\r\rAnd suddenly it seemed that day to day\r    Was added, as if He who has the power\r    Had with another sun the heaven adorned.\r\rWith eyes upon the everlasting wheels\r    Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her\r    Fixing my vision from above removed,\r\rSuch at her aspect inwardly became\r    As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him\r    Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.\r\rTo represent transhumanise in words\r    Impossible were; the example, then, suffice\r    Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.\r\rIf I was merely what of me thou newly\r    Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,\r    Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!\r\rWhen now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal\r    Desiring thee, made me attentive to it\r    By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,\r\rThen seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled\r    By the sun\xc3\x95s flame, that neither rain nor river\r    E\xc3\x95er made a lake so widely spread abroad.\r\rThe newness of the sound and the great light\r    Kindled in me a longing for their cause,\r    Never before with such acuteness felt;\r\rWhence she, who saw me as I saw myself,\r    To quiet in me my perturbed mind,\r    Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,\r\rAnd she began: \xc3\x92Thou makest thyself so dull\r    With false imagining, that thou seest not\r    What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.\r\rThou art not upon earth, as thou believest;\r    But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,\r    Ne\xc3\x95er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest.\xc3\x93\r\rIf of my former doubt I was divested\r    By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,\r    I in a new one was the more ensnared;\r\rAnd said: \xc3\x92Already did I rest content\r    From great amazement; but am now amazed\r    In what way I transcend these bodies light.\xc3\x93\r\rWhereupon she, after a pitying sigh,\r    Her eyes directed tow\xc3\x95rds me with that look\r    A mother casts on a delirious child;\r\rAnd she began: \xc3\x92All things whate\xc3\x95er they be\r    Have order among themselves, and this is form,\r    That makes the universe resemble God.\r\rHere do the higher creatures see the footprints\r    Of the Eternal Power, which is the end\r    Whereto is made the law already mentioned.\r\rIn the order that I speak of are inclined\r    All natures, by their destinies diverse,\r    More or less near unto their origin;\r\rHence they move onward unto ports diverse\r    O\xc3\x95er the great sea of being; and each one\r    With instinct given it which bears it on.\r\rThis bears away the fire towards the moon;\r    This is in mortal hearts the motive power\r    This binds together and unites the earth.\r\rNor only the created things that are\r    Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,\r    But those that have both intellect and love.\r\rThe Providence that regulates all this\r    Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,\r    Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.\r\rAnd thither now, as to a site decreed,\r    Bears us away the virtue of that cord\r    Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.\r\rTrue is it, that as oftentimes the form\r    Accords not with the intention of the art,\r    Because in answering is matter deaf,\r\rSo likewise from this course doth deviate\r    Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,\r    Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,\r\r(In the same wise as one may see the fire\r    Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus\r    Earthward is wrested by some false delight.\r\rThou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,\r    At thine ascent, than at a rivulet\r    From some high mount descending to the lowland.\r\rMarvel it would be in thee, if deprived\r    Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,\r    As if on earth the living fire were quiet.\xc3\x93\r\rThereat she heavenward turned again her face.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto II\r\r\rO Ye, who in some pretty little boat,\r    Eager to listen, have been following\r    Behind my ship, that singing sails along,\r\rTurn back to look again upon your shores;\r    Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,\r    In losing me, you might yourselves be lost.\r\rThe sea I sail has never yet been passed;\r    Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,\r    And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.\r\rYe other few who have the neck uplifted\r    Betimes to th\xc3\x95 bread of Angels upon which\r    One liveth here and grows not sated by it,\r\rWell may you launch upon the deep salt-sea\r    Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you\r    Upon the water that grows smooth again.\r\rThose glorious ones who unto Colchos passed\r    Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,\r    When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!\r\rThe con-created and perpetual thirst\r    For the realm deiform did bear us on,\r    As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.\r\rUpward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;\r    And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt\r    And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,\r\rArrived I saw me where a wondrous thing\r    Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she\r    From whom no care of mine could be concealed,\r\rTowards me turning, blithe as beautiful,\r    Said unto me: \xc3\x92Fix gratefully thy mind\r    On God, who unto the first star has brought us.\xc3\x93\r\rIt seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,\r    Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright\r    As adamant on which the sun is striking.\r\rInto itself did the eternal pearl\r    Receive us, even as water doth receive\r    A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.\r\rIf I was body, (and we here conceive not\r    How one dimension tolerates another,\r    Which needs must be if body enter body,)\r\rMore the desire should be enkindled in us\r    That essence to behold, wherein is seen\r    How God and our own nature were united.\r\rThere will be seen what we receive by faith,\r    Not demonstrated, but self-evident\r    In guise of the first truth that man believes.\r\rI made reply: \xc3\x92Madonna, as devoutly\r    As most I can do I give thanks to Him\r    Who has removed me from the mortal world.\r\rBut tell me what the dusky spots may be\r    Upon this body, which below on earth\r    Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?\xc3\x93\r\rSomewhat she smiled; and then, \xc3\x92If the opinion\r    Of mortals be erroneous,\xc3\x93 she said,\r    \xc3\x92Where\xc3\x95er the key of sense doth not unlock,\r\rCertes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee\r    Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,\r    Thou seest that the reason has short wings.\r\rBut tell me what thou think\xc3\x95st of it thyself.\xc3\x93\r    And I: \xc3\x92What seems to us up here diverse,\r    Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd she: \xc3\x92Right truly shalt thou see immersed\r    In error thy belief, if well thou hearest\r    The argument that I shall make against it.\r\rLights many the eighth sphere displays to you\r    Which in their quality and quantity\r    May noted be of aspects different.\r\rIf this were caused by rare and dense alone,\r    One only virtue would there be in all\r    Or more or less diffused, or equally.\r\rVirtues diverse must be perforce the fruits\r    Of formal principles; and these, save one,\r    Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.\r\rBesides, if rarity were of this dimness\r    The cause thou askest, either through and through\r    This planet thus attenuate were of matter,\r\rOr else, as in a body is apportioned\r    The fat and lean, so in like manner this\r    Would in its volume interchange the leaves.\r\rWere it the former, in the sun\xc3\x95s eclipse\r    It would be manifest by the shining through\r    Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.\r\rThis is not so; hence we must scan the other,\r    And if it chance the other I demolish,\r    Then falsified will thy opinion be.\r\rBut if this rarity go not through and through,\r    There needs must be a limit, beyond which\r    Its contrary prevents the further passing,\r\rAnd thence the foreign radiance is reflected,\r    Even as a colour cometh back from glass,\r    The which behind itself concealeth lead.\r\rNow thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself\r    More dimly there than in the other parts,\r    By being there reflected farther back.\r\rFrom this reply experiment will free thee\r    If e\xc3\x95er thou try it, which is wont to be\r    The fountain to the rivers of your arts.\r\rThree mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove\r    Alike from thee, the other more remote\r    Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.\r\rTurned towards these, cause that behind thy back\r    Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors\r    And coming back to thee by all reflected.\r\rThough in its quantity be not so ample\r    The image most remote, there shalt thou see\r    How it perforce is equally resplendent.\r\rNow, as beneath the touches of warm rays\r    Naked the subject of the snow remains\r    Both of its former colour and its cold,\r\rThee thus remaining in thy intellect,\r    Will I inform with such a living light,\r    That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.\r\rWithin the heaven of the divine repose\r    Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies\r    The being of whatever it contains.\r\rThe following heaven, that has so many eyes,\r    Divides this being by essences diverse,\r    Distinguished from it, and by it contained.\r\rThe other spheres, by various differences,\r    All the distinctions which they have within them\r    Dispose unto their ends and their effects.\r\rThus do these organs of the world proceed,\r    As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;\r    Since from above they take, and act beneath.\r\rObserve me well, how through this place I come\r    Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter\r    Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford\r\rThe power and motion of the holy spheres,\r    As from the artisan the hammer\xc3\x95s craft,\r    Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.\r\rThe heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,\r    From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,\r    The image takes, and makes of it a seal.\r\rAnd even as the soul within your dust\r    Through members different and accommodated\r    To faculties diverse expands itself,\r\rSo likewise this Intelligence diffuses\r    Its virtue multiplied among the stars.\r    Itself revolving on its unity.\r\rVirtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage\r    Make with the precious body that it quickens,\r    In which, as life in you, it is combined.\r\rFrom the glad nature whence it is derived,\r    The mingled virtue through the body shines,\r    Even as gladness through the living pupil.\r\rFrom this proceeds whate\xc3\x95er from light to light\r    Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:\r    This is the formal principle that produces,\r\rAccording to its goodness, dark and bright.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto III\r\r\rThat Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,\r    Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,\r    By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.\r\rAnd, that I might confess myself convinced\r    And confident, so far as was befitting,\r    I lifted more erect my head to speak.\r\rBut there appeared a vision, which withdrew me\r    So close to it, in order to be seen,\r    That my confession I remembered not.\r\rSuch as through polished and transparent glass,\r    Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,\r    But not so deep as that their bed be lost,\r\rCome back again the outlines of our faces\r    So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white\r    Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;\r\rSuch saw I many faces prompt to speak,\r    So that I ran in error opposite\r    To that which kindled love \xc3\x95twixt man and fountain.\r\rAs soon as I became aware of them,\r    Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,\r    To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,\r\rAnd nothing saw, and once more turned them forward\r    Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,\r    Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.\r\r\xc3\x92Marvel thou not,\xc3\x93 she said to me, \xc3\x92because\r    I smile at this thy puerile conceit,\r    Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,\r\rBut turns thee, as \xc3\x95tis wont, on emptiness.\r    True substances are these which thou beholdest,\r    Here relegate for breaking of some vow.\r\rTherefore speak with them, listen and believe;\r    For the true light, which giveth peace to them,\r    Permits them not to turn from it their feet.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I unto the shade that seemed most wishful\r    To speak directed me, and I began,\r    As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:\r\r\xc3\x92O well-created spirit, who in the rays\r    Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste\r    Which being untasted ne\xc3\x95er is comprehended,\r\rGrateful \xc3\x95twill be to me, if thou content me\r    Both with thy name and with your destiny.\xc3\x93\r    Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:\r\r\xc3\x92Our charity doth never shut the doors\r    Against a just desire, except as one\r    Who wills that all her court be like herself.\r\rI was a virgin sister in the world;\r    And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,\r    The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,\r\rBut thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,\r    Who, stationed here among these other blessed,\r    Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.\r\rAll our affections, that alone inflamed\r    Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,\r    Rejoice at being of his order formed;\r\rAnd this allotment, which appears so low,\r    Therefore is given us, because our vows\r    Have been neglected and in some part void.\xc3\x93\r\rWhence I to her: \xc3\x92In your miraculous aspects\r    There shines I know not what of the divine,\r    Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.\r\rTherefore I was not swift in my remembrance;\r    But what thou tellest me now aids me so,\r    That the refiguring is easier to me.\r\rBut tell me, ye who in this place are happy,\r    Are you desirous of a higher place,\r    To see more or to make yourselves more friends?\xc3\x93\r\rFirst with those other shades she smiled a little;\r    Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,\r    She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:\r\r\xc3\x92Brother, our will is quieted by virtue\r    Of charity, that makes us wish alone\r    For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.\r\rIf to be more exalted we aspired,\r    Discordant would our aspirations be\r    Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;\r\rWhich thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,\r    If being in charity is needful here,\r    And if thou lookest well into its nature;\r\rNay, \xc3\x95tis essential to this blest existence\r    To keep itself within the will divine,\r    Whereby our very wishes are made one;\r\rSo that, as we are station above station\r    Throughout this realm, to all the realm \xc3\x95tis pleasing,\r    As to the King, who makes his will our will.\r\rAnd his will is our peace; this is the sea\r    To which is moving onward whatsoever\r    It doth create, and all that nature makes.\xc3\x93\r\rThen it was clear to me how everywhere\r    In heaven is Paradise, although the grace\r    Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.\r\rBut as it comes to pass, if one food sates,\r    And for another still remains the longing,\r    We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,\r\rE\xc3\x95en thus did I; with gesture and with word,\r    To learn from her what was the web wherein\r    She did not ply the shuttle to the end.\r\r\xc3\x92A perfect life and merit high in-heaven\r    A lady o\xc3\x95er us,\xc3\x93 said she, \xc3\x92by whose rule\r    Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,\r\rThat until death they may both watch and sleep\r    Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts\r    Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.\r\rTo follow her, in girlhood from the world\r    I fled, and in her habit shut myself,\r    And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.\r\rThen men accustomed unto evil more\r    Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;\r    God knows what afterward my life became.\r\rThis other splendour, which to thee reveals\r    Itself on my right side, and is enkindled\r    With all the illumination of our sphere,\r\rWhat of myself I say applies to her;\r    A nun was she, and likewise from her head\r    Was ta\xc3\x95en the shadow of the sacred wimple.\r\rBut when she too was to the world returned\r    Against her wishes and against good usage,\r    Of the heart\xc3\x95s veil she never was divested.\r\rOf great Costanza this is the effulgence,\r    Who from the second wind of Suabia\r    Brought forth the third and latest puissance.\xc3\x93\r\rThus unto me she spake, and then began\r    \xc3\x92Ave Maria\xc3\x93 singing, and in singing\r    Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.\r\rMy sight, that followed her as long a time\r    As it was possible, when it had lost her\r    Turned round unto the mark of more desire,\r\rAnd wholly unto Beatrice reverted;\r    But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,\r    That at the first my sight endured it not;\r\rAnd this in questioning more backward made me.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto IV\r\r\rBetween two viands, equally removed\r    And tempting, a free man would die of hunger\r    Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.\r\rSo would a lamb between the ravenings\r    Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;\r    And so would stand a dog between two does.\r\rHence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,\r    Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,\r    Since it must be so, nor do I commend.\r\rI held my peace; but my desire was painted\r    Upon my face, and questioning with that\r    More fervent far than by articulate speech.\r\rBeatrice did as Daniel had done\r    Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath\r    Which rendered him unjustly merciless,\r\rAnd said: \xc3\x92Well see I how attracteth thee\r    One and the other wish, so that thy care\r    Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.\r\rThou arguest, if good will be permanent,\r    The violence of others, for what reason\r    Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?\r\rAgain for doubting furnish thee occasion\r    Souls seeming to return unto the stars,\r    According to the sentiment of Plato.\r\rThese are the questions which upon thy wish\r    Are thrusting equally; and therefore first\r    Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.\r\rHe of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,\r    Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John\r    Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,\r\rHave not in any other heaven their seats,\r    Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,\r    Nor of existence more or fewer years;\r\rBut all make beautiful the primal circle,\r    And have sweet life in different degrees,\r    By feeling more or less the eternal breath.\r\rThey showed themselves here, not because allotted\r    This sphere has been to them, but to give sign\r    Of the celestial which is least exalted.\r\rTo speak thus is adapted to your mind,\r    Since only through the sense it apprehendeth\r    What then it worthy makes of intellect.\r\rOn this account the Scripture condescends\r    Unto your faculties, and feet and hands\r    To God attributes, and means something else;\r\rAnd Holy Church under an aspect human\r    Gabriel and Michael represent to you,\r    And him who made Tobias whole again.\r\rThat which Timaeus argues of the soul\r    Doth not resemble that which here is seen,\r    Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.\r\rHe says the soul unto its star returns,\r    Believing it to have been severed thence\r    Whenever nature gave it as a form.\r\rPerhaps his doctrine is of other guise\r    Than the words sound, and possibly may be\r    With meaning that is not to be derided.\r\rIf he doth mean that to these wheels return\r    The honour of their influence and the blame,\r    Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.\r\rThis principle ill understood once warped\r    The whole world nearly, till it went astray\r    Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.\r\rThe other doubt which doth disquiet thee\r    Less venom has, for its malevolence\r    Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.\r\rThat as unjust our justice should appear\r    In eyes of mortals, is an argument\r    Of faith, and not of sin heretical.\r\rBut still, that your perception may be able\r    To thoroughly penetrate this verity,\r    As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.\r\rIf it be violence when he who suffers\r    Co-operates not with him who uses force,\r    These souls were not on that account excused;\r\rFor will is never quenched unless it will,\r    But operates as nature doth in fire\r    If violence a thousand times distort it.\r\rHence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds\r    The force; and these have done so, having power\r    Of turning back unto the holy place.\r\rIf their will had been perfect, like to that\r    Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,\r    And Mutius made severe to his own hand,\r\rIt would have urged them back along the road\r    Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;\r    But such a solid will is all too rare.\r\rAnd by these words, if thou hast gathered them\r    As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted\r    That would have still annoyed thee many times.\r\rBut now another passage runs across\r    Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself\r    Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.\r\rI have for certain put into thy mind\r    That soul beatified could never lie,\r    For it is near the primal Truth,\r\rAnd then thou from Piccarda might\xc3\x95st have heard\r    Costanza kept affection for the veil,\r    So that she seemeth here to contradict me.\r\rMany times, brother, has it come to pass,\r    That, to escape from peril, with reluctance\r    That has been done it was not right to do,\r\rE\xc3\x95en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father\r    Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)\r    Not to lose pity pitiless became.\r\rAt this point I desire thee to remember\r    That force with will commingles, and they cause\r    That the offences cannot be excused.\r\rWill absolute consenteth not to evil;\r    But in so far consenteth as it fears,\r    If it refrain, to fall into more harm.\r\rHence when Piccarda uses this expression,\r    She meaneth the will absolute, and I\r    The other, so that both of us speak truth.\xc3\x93\r\rSuch was the flowing of the holy river\r    That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;\r    This put to rest my wishes one and all.\r\r\xc3\x92O love of the first lover, O divine,\xc3\x93\r    Said I forthwith, \xc3\x92whose speech inundates me\r    And warms me so, it more and more revives me,\r\rMy own affection is not so profound\r    As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;\r    Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.\r\rWell I perceive that never sated is\r    Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,\r    Beyond which nothing true expands itself.\r\rIt rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,\r    When it attains it; and it can attain it;\r    If not, then each desire would frustrate be.\r\rTherefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,\r    Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,\r    Which to the top from height to height impels us.\r\rThis doth invite me, this assurance give me\r    With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you\r    Another truth, which is obscure to me.\r\rI wish to know if man can satisfy you\r    For broken vows with other good deeds, so\r    That in your balance they will not be light.\xc3\x93\r\rBeatrice gazed upon me with her eyes\r    Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,\r    That, overcome my power, I turned my back\r\rAnd almost lost myself with eyes downcast.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto V\r\r\r\xc3\x92If in the heat of love I flame upon thee\r    Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,\r    So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,\r\rMarvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds\r    From perfect sight, which as it apprehends\r    To the good apprehended moves its feet.\r\rWell I perceive how is already shining\r    Into thine intellect the eternal light,\r    That only seen enkindles always love;\r\rAnd if some other thing your love seduce,\r    \xc3\x95Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,\r    Ill understood, which there is shining through.\r\rThou fain wouldst know if with another service\r    For broken vow can such return be made\r    As to secure the soul from further claim.\xc3\x93\r\rThis Canto thus did Beatrice begin;\r    And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,\r    Continued thus her holy argument:\r\r\xc3\x92The greatest gift that in his largess God\r    Creating made, and unto his own goodness\r    Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize\r\rMost highly, is the freedom of the will,\r    Wherewith the creatures of intelligence\r    Both all and only were and are endowed.\r\rNow wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,\r    The high worth of a vow, if it he made\r    So that when thou consentest God consents:\r\rFor, closing between God and man the compact,\r    A sacrifice is of this treasure made,\r    Such as I say, and made by its own act.\r\rWhat can be rendered then as compensation?\r    Think\xc3\x95st thou to make good use of what thou\xc3\x95st offered,\r    With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.\r\rNow art thou certain of the greater point;\r    But because Holy Church in this dispenses,\r    Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,\r\rBehoves thee still to sit awhile at table,\r    Because the solid food which thou hast taken\r    Requireth further aid for thy digestion.\r\rOpen thy mind to that which I reveal,\r    And fix it there within; for \xc3\x95tis not knowledge,\r    The having heard without retaining it.\r\rIn the essence of this sacrifice two things\r    Convene together; and the one is that\r    Of which \xc3\x95tis made, the other is the agreement.\r\rThis last for evermore is cancelled not\r    Unless complied with, and concerning this\r    With such precision has above been spoken.\r\rTherefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews\r    To offer still, though sometimes what was offered\r    Might be commuted, as thou ought\xc3\x95st to know.\r\rThe other, which is known to thee as matter,\r    May well indeed be such that one errs not\r    If it for other matter be exchanged.\r\rBut let none shift the burden on his shoulder\r    At his arbitrament, without the turning\r    Both of the white and of the yellow key;\r\rAnd every permutation deem as foolish,\r    If in the substitute the thing relinquished,\r    As the four is in six, be not contained.\r\rTherefore whatever thing has so great weight\r    In value that it drags down every balance,\r    Cannot be satisfied with other spending.\r\rLet mortals never take a vow in jest;\r    Be faithful and not blind in doing that,\r    As Jephthah was in his first offering,\r\rWhom more beseemed to say, \xc3\x94I have done wrong,\r    Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish\r    Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,\r\rWhence wept Iphigenia her fair face,\r    And made for her both wise and simple weep,\r    Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.\xc3\x95\r\rChristians, be ye more serious in your movements;\r    Be ye not like a feather at each wind,\r    And think not every water washes you.\r\rYe have the Old and the New Testament,\r    And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you\r    Let this suffice you unto your salvation.\r\rIf evil appetite cry aught else to you,\r    Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,\r    So that the Jew among you may not mock you.\r\rBe ye not as the lamb that doth abandon\r    Its mother\xc3\x95s milk, and frolicsome and simple\r    Combats at its own pleasure with itself.\xc3\x93\r\rThus Beatrice to me even as I write it;\r    Then all desireful turned herself again\r    To that part where the world is most alive.\r\rHer silence and her change of countenance\r    Silence imposed upon my eager mind,\r    That had already in advance new questions;\r\rAnd as an arrow that upon the mark\r    Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,\r    So did we speed into the second realm.\r\rMy Lady there so joyful I beheld,\r    As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,\r    More luminous thereat the planet grew;\r\rAnd if the star itself was changed and smiled,\r    What became I, who by my nature am\r    Exceeding mutable in every guise!\r\rAs, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,\r    The fishes draw to that which from without\r    Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;\r\rSo I beheld more than a thousand splendours\r    Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:\r    \xc3\x92Lo, this is she who shall increase our love.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd as each one was coming unto us,\r    Full of beatitude the shade was seen,\r    By the effulgence clear that issued from it.\r\rThink, Reader, if what here is just beginning\r    No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have\r    An agonizing need of knowing more;\r\rAnd of thyself thou\xc3\x95lt see how I from these\r    Was in desire of hearing their conditions,\r    As they unto mine eyes were manifest.\r\r\xc3\x92O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes\r    To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,\r    Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned\r\rWith light that through the whole of heaven is spread\r    Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest\r    To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee.\xc3\x93\r\rThus by some one among those holy spirits\r    Was spoken, and by Beatrice: \xc3\x92Speak, speak\r    Securely, and believe them even as Gods.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself\r    In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,\r    Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,\r\rBut know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,\r    Spirit august, thy station in the sphere\r    That veils itself to men in alien rays.\xc3\x93\r\rThis said I in direction of the light\r    Which first had spoken to me; whence it became\r    By far more lucent than it was before.\r\rEven as the sun, that doth conceal himself\r    By too much light, when heat has worn away\r    The tempering influence of the vapours dense,\r\rBy greater rapture thus concealed itself\r    In its own radiance the figure saintly,\r    And thus close, close enfolded answered me\r\rIn fashion as the following Canto sings.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto VI\r\r\r\xc3\x92After that Constantine the eagle turned\r    Against the course of heaven, which it had followed\r    Behind the ancient who Lavinia took,\r\rTwo hundred years and more the bird of God\r    In the extreme of Europe held itself,\r    Near to the mountains whence it issued first;\r\rAnd under shadow of the sacred plumes\r    It governed there the world from hand to hand,\r    And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted.\r\rCaesar I was, and am Justinian,\r    Who, by the will of primal Love I feel,\r    Took from the laws the useless and redundant;\r\rAnd ere unto the work I was attent,\r    One nature to exist in Christ, not more,\r    Believed, and with such faith was I contented.\r\rBut blessed Agapetus, he who was\r    The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere\r    Pointed me out the way by words of his.\r\rHim I believed, and what was his assertion\r    I now see clearly, even as thou seest\r    Each contradiction to be false and true.\r\rAs soon as with the Church I moved my feet,\r    God in his grace it pleased with this high task\r    To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it,\r\rAnd to my Belisarius I commended\r    The arms, to which was heaven\xc3\x95s right hand so joined\r    It was a signal that I should repose.\r\rNow here to the first question terminates\r    My answer; but the character thereof\r    Constrains me to continue with a sequel,\r\rIn order that thou see with how great reason\r    Men move against the standard sacrosanct,\r    Both who appropriate and who oppose it.\r\rBehold how great a power has made it worthy\r    Of reverence, beginning from the hour\r    When Pallas died to give it sovereignty.\r\rThou knowest it made in Alba its abode\r    Three hundred years and upward, till at last\r    The three to three fought for it yet again.\r\rThou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong\r    Down to Lucretia\xc3\x95s sorrow, in seven kings\r    O\xc3\x95ercoming round about the neighboring nations;\r\rThou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans\r    Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,\r    Against the other princes and confederates.\r\rTorquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks\r    Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,\r    Received the fame I willingly embalm;\r\rIt struck to earth the pride of the Arabians,\r    Who, following Hannibal, had passed across\r    The Alpine ridges, Po, from which thou glidest;\r\rBeneath it triumphed while they yet were young\r    Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill\r    Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;\r\rThen, near unto the time when heaven had willed\r    To bring the whole world to its mood serene,\r    Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it.\r\rWhat it achieved from Var unto the Rhine,\r    Isere beheld and Saone, beheld the Seine,\r    And every valley whence the Rhone is filled;\r\rWhat it achieved when it had left Ravenna,\r    And leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight\r    That neither tongue nor pen could follow it.\r\rRound towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then\r    Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote\r    That to the calid Nile was felt the pain.\r\rAntandros and the Simois, whence it started,\r    It saw again, and there where Hector lies,\r    And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself.\r\rFrom thence it came like lightning upon Juba;\r    Then wheeled itself again into your West,\r    Where the Pompeian clarion it heard.\r\rFrom what it wrought with the next standard-bearer\r    Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together,\r    And Modena and Perugia dolent were;\r\rStill doth the mournful Cleopatra weep\r    Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it,\r    Took from the adder sudden and black death.\r\rWith him it ran even to the Red Sea shore;\r    With him it placed the world in so great peace,\r    That unto Janus was his temple closed.\r\rBut what the standard that has made me speak\r    Achieved before, and after should achieve\r    Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it,\r\rBecometh in appearance mean and dim,\r    If in the hand of the third Caesar seen\r    With eye unclouded and affection pure,\r\rBecause the living Justice that inspires me\r    Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,\r    The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath.\r\rNow here attend to what I answer thee;\r    Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance\r    Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin.\r\rAnd when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten\r    The Holy Church, then underneath its wings\r    Did Charlemagne victorious succor her.\r\rNow hast thou power to judge of such as those\r    Whom I accused above, and of their crimes,\r    Which are the cause of all your miseries.\r\rTo the public standard one the yellow lilies\r    Opposes, the other claims it for a party,\r    So that \xc3\x95tis hard to see which sins the most.\r\rLet, let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft\r    Beneath some other standard; for this ever\r    Ill follows he who it and justice parts.\r\rAnd let not this new Charles e\xc3\x95er strike it down,\r    He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons\r    That from a nobler lion stripped the fell.\r\rAlready oftentimes the sons have wept\r    The father\xc3\x95s crime; and let him not believe\r    That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies.\r\rThis little planet doth adorn itself\r    With the good spirits that have active been,\r    That fame and honour might come after them;\r\rAnd whensoever the desires mount thither,\r    Thus deviating, must perforce the rays\r    Of the true love less vividly mount upward.\r\rBut in commensuration of our wages\r    With our desert is portion of our joy,\r    Because we see them neither less nor greater.\r\rHerein doth living Justice sweeten so\r    Affection in us, that for evermore\r    It cannot warp to any iniquity.\r\rVoices diverse make up sweet melodies;\r    So in this life of ours the seats diverse\r    Render sweet harmony among these spheres;\r\rAnd in the compass of this present pearl\r    Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom\r    The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded.\r\rBut the Provencals who against him wrought,\r    They have not laughed, and therefore ill goes he\r    Who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others.\r\rFour daughters, and each one of them a queen,\r    Had Raymond Berenger, and this for him\r    Did Romeo, a poor man and a pilgrim;\r\rAnd then malicious words incited him\r    To summon to a reckoning this just man,\r    Who rendered to him seven and five for ten.\r\rThen he departed poor and stricken in years,\r    And if the world could know the heart he had,\r    In begging bit by bit his livelihood,\r\rThough much it laud him, it would laud him more.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto VII\r\r\r\xc3\x92Osanna sanctus Deus Sabaoth,\r    Superillustrans claritate tua\r    Felices ignes horum malahoth!\xc3\x93\r\rIn this wise, to his melody returning,\r    This substance, upon which a double light\r    Doubles itself, was seen by me to sing,\r\rAnd to their dance this and the others moved,\r    And in the manner of swift-hurrying sparks\r    Veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance.\r\rDoubting was I, and saying, \xc3\x92Tell her, tell her,\xc3\x93\r    Within me, \xc3\x92tell her,\xc3\x93 saying, \xc3\x92tell my Lady,\xc3\x93\r    Who slakes my thirst with her sweet effluences;\r\rAnd yet that reverence which doth lord it over\r    The whole of me only by B and ICE,\r    Bowed me again like unto one who drowses.\r\rShort while did Beatrice endure me thus;\r    And she began, lighting me with a smile\r    Such as would make one happy in the fire:\r\r\xc3\x92According to infallible advisement,\r    After what manner a just vengeance justly\r    Could be avenged has put thee upon thinking,\r\rBut I will speedily thy mind unloose;\r    And do thou listen, for these words of mine\r    Of a great doctrine will a present make thee.\r\rBy not enduring on the power that wills\r    Curb for his good, that man who ne\xc3\x95er was born,\r    Damning himself damned all his progeny;\r\rWhereby the human species down below\r    Lay sick for many centuries in great error,\r    Till to descend it pleased the Word of God\r\rTo where the nature, which from its own Maker\r    Estranged itself, he joined to him in person\r    By the sole act of his eternal love.\r\rNow unto what is said direct thy sight;\r    This nature when united to its Maker,\r    Such as created, was sincere and good;\r\rBut by itself alone was banished forth\r    From Paradise, because it turned aside\r    Out of the way of truth and of its life.\r\rTherefore the penalty the cross held out,\r    If measured by the nature thus assumed,\r    None ever yet with so great justice stung,\r\rAnd none was ever of so great injustice,\r    Considering who the Person was that suffered,\r    Within whom such a nature was contracted.\r\rFrom one act therefore issued things diverse;\r    To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing;\r    Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened.\r\rIt should no longer now seem difficult\r    To thee, when it is said that a just vengeance\r    By a just court was afterward avenged.\r\rBut now do I behold thy mind entangled\r    From thought to thought within a knot, from which\r    With great desire it waits to free itself.\r\rThou sayest, \xc3\x94Well discern I what I hear;\r    But it is hidden from me why God willed\r    For our redemption only this one mode.\xc3\x95\r\rBuried remaineth, brother, this decree\r    Unto the eyes of every one whose nature\r    Is in the flame of love not yet adult.\r\rVerily, inasmuch as at this mark\r    One gazes long and little is discerned,\r    Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say.\r\rGoodness Divine, which from itself doth spurn\r    All envy, burning in itself so sparkles\r    That the eternal beauties it unfolds.\r\rWhate\xc3\x95er from this immediately distils\r    Has afterwards no end, for ne\xc3\x95er removed\r    Is its impression when it sets its seal.\r\rWhate\xc3\x95er from this immediately rains down\r    Is wholly free, because it is not subject\r    Unto the influences of novel things.\r\rThe more conformed thereto, the more it pleases;\r    For the blest ardour that irradiates all things\r    In that most like itself is most vivacious.\r\rWith all of these things has advantaged been\r    The human creature; and if one be wanting,\r    From his nobility he needs must fall.\r\r\xc3\x95Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,\r    And render him unlike the Good Supreme,\r    So that he little with its light is blanched,\r\rAnd to his dignity no more returns,\r    Unless he fill up where transgression empties\r    With righteous pains for criminal delights.\r\rYour nature when it sinned so utterly\r    In its own seed, out of these dignities\r    Even as out of Paradise was driven,\r\rNor could itself recover, if thou notest\r    With nicest subtilty, by any way,\r    Except by passing one of these two fords:\r\rEither that God through clemency alone\r    Had pardon granted, or that man himself\r    Had satisfaction for his folly made.\r\rFix now thine eye deep into the abyss\r    Of the eternal counsel, to my speech\r    As far as may be fastened steadfastly!\r\rMan in his limitations had not power\r    To satisfy, not having power to sink\r    In his humility obeying then,\r\rFar as he disobeying thought to rise;\r    And for this reason man has been from power\r    Of satisfying by himself excluded.\r\rTherefore it God behoved in his own ways\r    Man to restore unto his perfect life,\r    I say in one, or else in both of them.\r\rBut since the action of the doer is\r    So much more grateful, as it more presents\r    The goodness of the heart from which it issues,\r\rGoodness Divine, that doth imprint the world,\r    Has been contented to proceed by each\r    And all its ways to lift you up again;\r\rNor \xc3\x95twixt the first day and the final night\r    Such high and such magnificent proceeding\r    By one or by the other was or shall be;\r\rFor God more bounteous was himself to give\r    To make man able to uplift himself,\r    Than if he only of himself had pardoned;\r\rAnd all the other modes were insufficient\r    For justice, were it not the Son of God\r    Himself had humbled to become incarnate.\r\rNow, to fill fully each desire of thine,\r    Return I to elucidate one place,\r    In order that thou there mayst see as I do.\r\rThou sayst: \xc3\x94I see the air, I see the fire,\r    The water, and the earth, and all their mixtures\r    Come to corruption, and short while endure;\r\rAnd these things notwithstanding were created;\xc3\x95\r    Therefore if that which I have said were true,\r    They should have been secure against corruption.\r\rThe Angels, brother, and the land sincere\r    In which thou art, created may be called\r    Just as they are in their entire existence;\r\rBut all the elements which thou hast named,\r    And all those things which out of them are made,\r    By a created virtue are informed.\r\rCreated was the matter which they have;\r    Created was the informing influence\r    Within these stars that round about them go.\r\rThe soul of every brute and of the plants\r    By its potential temperament attracts\r    The ray and motion of the holy lights;\r\rBut your own life immediately inspires\r    Supreme Beneficence, and enamours it\r    So with herself, it evermore desires her.\r\rAnd thou from this mayst argue furthermore\r    Your resurrection, if thou think again\r    How human flesh was fashioned at that time\r\rWhen the first parents both of them were made.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto VIII\r\r\rThe world used in its peril to believe\r    That the fair Cypria delirious love\r    Rayed out, in the third epicycle turning;\r\rWherefore not only unto her paid honour\r    Of sacrifices and of votive cry\r    The ancient nations in the ancient error,\r\rBut both Dione honoured they and Cupid,\r    That as her mother, this one as her son,\r    And said that he had sat in Dido\xc3\x95s lap;\r\rAnd they from her, whence I beginning take,\r    Took the denomination of the star\r    That woos the sun, now following, now in front.\r\rI was not ware of our ascending to it;\r    But of our being in it gave full faith\r    My Lady whom I saw more beauteous grow.\r\rAnd as within a flame a spark is seen,\r    And as within a voice a voice discerned,\r    When one is steadfast, and one comes and goes,\r\rWithin that light beheld I other lamps\r    Move in a circle, speeding more and less,\r    Methinks in measure of their inward vision.\r\rFrom a cold cloud descended never winds,\r    Or visible or not, so rapidly\r    They would not laggard and impeded seem\r\rTo any one who had those lights divine\r    Seen come towards us, leaving the gyration\r    Begun at first in the high Seraphim.\r\rAnd behind those that most in front appeared\r    Sounded \xc3\x92Osanna!\xc3\x93 so that never since\r    To hear again was I without desire.\r\rThen unto us more nearly one approached,\r    And it alone began: \xc3\x92We all are ready\r    Unto thy pleasure, that thou joy in us.\r\rWe turn around with the celestial Princes,\r    One gyre and one gyration and one thirst,\r    To whom thou in the world of old didst say,\r\r\xc3\x94Ye who, intelligent, the third heaven are moving;\xc3\x95\r    And are so full of love, to pleasure thee\r    A little quiet will not be less sweet.\xc3\x93\r\rAfter these eyes of mine themselves had offered\r    Unto my Lady reverently, and she\r    Content and certain of herself had made them,\r\rBack to the light they turned, which so great promise\r    Made of itself, and \xc3\x92Say, who art thou?\xc3\x93 was\r    My voice, imprinted with a great affection.\r\rO how and how much I beheld it grow\r    With the new joy that superadded was\r    Unto its joys, as soon as I had spoken!\r\rThus changed, it said to me: \xc3\x92The world possessed me\r    Short time below; and, if it had been more,\r    Much evil will be which would not have been.\r\rMy gladness keepeth me concealed from thee,\r    Which rayeth round about me, and doth hide me\r    Like as a creature swathed in its own silk.\r\rMuch didst thou love me, and thou hadst good reason;\r    For had I been below, I should have shown thee\r    Somewhat beyond the foliage of my love.\r\rThat left-hand margin, which doth bathe itself\r    In Rhone, when it is mingled with the Sorgue,\r    Me for its lord awaited in due time,\r\rAnd that horn of Ausonia, which is towned\r    With Bari, with Gaeta and Catona,\r    Whence Tronto and Verde in the sea disgorge.\r\rAlready flashed upon my brow the crown\r    Of that dominion which the Danube waters\r    After the German borders it abandons;\r\rAnd beautiful Trinacria, that is murky\r    \xc3\x95Twixt Pachino and Peloro, (on the gulf\r    Which greatest scath from Eurus doth receive,)\r\rNot through Typhoeus, but through nascent sulphur,\r    Would have awaited her own monarchs still,\r    Through me from Charles descended and from Rudolph,\r\rIf evil lordship, that exasperates ever\r    The subject populations, had not moved\r    Palermo to the outcry of \xc3\x94Death! death!\xc3\x95\r\rAnd if my brother could but this foresee,\r    The greedy poverty of Catalonia\r    Straight would he flee, that it might not molest him;\r\rFor verily \xc3\x95tis needful to provide,\r    Through him or other, so that on his bark\r    Already freighted no more freight be placed.\r\rHis nature, which from liberal covetous\r    Descended, such a soldiery would need\r    As should not care for hoarding in a chest.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Because I do believe the lofty joy\r    Thy speech infuses into me, my Lord,\r    Where every good thing doth begin and end\r\rThou seest as I see it, the more grateful\r    Is it to me; and this too hold I dear,\r    That gazing upon God thou dost discern it.\r\rGlad hast thou made me; so make clear to me,\r    Since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt,\r    How from sweet seed can bitter issue forth.\xc3\x93\r\rThis I to him; and he to me: \xc3\x92If I\r    Can show to thee a truth, to what thou askest\r    Thy face thou\xc3\x95lt hold as thou dost hold thy back.\r\rThe Good which all the realm thou art ascending\r    Turns and contents, maketh its providence\r    To be a power within these bodies vast;\r\rAnd not alone the natures are foreseen\r    Within the mind that in itself is perfect,\r    But they together with their preservation.\r\rFor whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth\r    Falls foreordained unto an end foreseen,\r    Even as a shaft directed to its mark.\r\rIf that were not, the heaven which thou dost walk\r    Would in such manner its effects produce,\r    That they no longer would be arts, but ruins.\r\rThis cannot be, if the Intelligences\r    That keep these stars in motion are not maimed,\r    And maimed the First that has not made them perfect.\r\rWilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee?\xc3\x93\r    And I: \xc3\x92Not so; for \xc3\x95tis impossible\r    That nature tire, I see, in what is needful.\xc3\x93\r\rWhence he again: \xc3\x92Now say, would it be worse\r    For men on earth were they not citizens?\xc3\x93\r    \xc3\x92Yes,\xc3\x93 I replied; \xc3\x92and here I ask no reason.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92And can they be so, if below they live not\r    Diversely unto offices diverse?\r    No, if your master writeth well for you.\xc3\x93\r\rSo came he with deductions to this point;\r    Then he concluded: \xc3\x92Therefore it behoves\r    The roots of your effects to be diverse.\r\rHence one is Solon born, another Xerxes,\r    Another Melchisedec, and another he\r    Who, flying through the air, his son did lose.\r\rRevolving Nature, which a signet is\r    To mortal wax, doth practise well her art,\r    But not one inn distinguish from another;\r\rThence happens it that Esau differeth\r    In seed from Jacob; and Quirinus comes\r    From sire so vile that he is given to Mars.\r\rA generated nature its own way\r    Would always make like its progenitors,\r    If Providence divine were not triumphant.\r\rNow that which was behind thee is before thee;\r    But that thou know that I with thee am pleased,\r    With a corollary will I mantle thee.\r\rEvermore nature, if it fortune find\r    Discordant to it, like each other seed\r    Out of its region, maketh evil thrift;\r\rAnd if the world below would fix its mind\r    On the foundation which is laid by nature,\r    Pursuing that, \xc3\x95twould have the people good.\r\rBut you unto religion wrench aside\r    Him who was born to gird him with the sword,\r    And make a king of him who is for sermons;\r\rTherefore your footsteps wander from the road.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto IX\r\r\rBeautiful Clemence, after that thy Charles\r    Had me enlightened, he narrated to me\r    The treacheries his seed should undergo;\r\rBut said: \xc3\x92Be still and let the years roll round;\xc3\x93\r    So I can only say, that lamentation\r    Legitimate shall follow on your wrongs.\r\rAnd of that holy light the life already\r    Had to the Sun which fills it turned again,\r    As to that good which for each thing sufficeth.\r\rAh, souls deceived, and creatures impious,\r    Who from such good do turn away your hearts,\r    Directing upon vanity your foreheads!\r\rAnd now, behold, another of those splendours\r    Approached me, and its will to pleasure me\r    It signified by brightening outwardly.\r\rThe eyes of Beatrice, that fastened were\r    Upon me, as before, of dear assent\r    To my desire assurance gave to me.\r\r\xc3\x92Ah, bring swift compensation to my wish,\r    Thou blessed spirit,\xc3\x93 I said, \xc3\x92and give me proof\r    That what I think in thee I can reflect!\xc3\x93\r\rWhereat the light, that still was new to me,\r    Out of its depths, whence it before was singing,\r    As one delighted to do good, continued:\r\r\xc3\x92Within that region of the land depraved\r    Of Italy, that lies between Rialto\r    And fountain-heads of Brenta and of Piava,\r\rRises a hill, and mounts not very high,\r    Wherefrom descended formerly a torch\r    That made upon that region great assault.\r\rOut of one root were born both I and it;\r    Cunizza was I called, and here I shine\r    Because the splendour of this star o\xc3\x95ercame me.\r\rBut gladly to myself the cause I pardon\r    Of my allotment, and it does not grieve me;\r    Which would perhaps seem strong unto your vulgar.\r\rOf this so luculent and precious jewel,\r    Which of our heaven is nearest unto me,\r    Great fame remained; and ere it die away\r\rThis hundredth year shall yet quintupled be.\r    See if man ought to make him excellent,\r    So that another life the first may leave!\r\rAnd thus thinks not the present multitude\r    Shut in by Adige and Tagliamento,\r    Nor yet for being scourged is penitent.\r\rBut soon \xc3\x95twill be that Padua in the marsh\r    Will change the water that Vicenza bathes,\r    Because the folk are stubborn against duty;\r\rAnd where the Sile and Cagnano join\r    One lordeth it, and goes with lofty head,\r    For catching whom e\xc3\x95en now the net is making.\r\rFeltro moreover of her impious pastor\r    Shall weep the crime, which shall so monstrous be\r    That for the like none ever entered Malta.\r\rAmple exceedingly would be the vat\r    That of the Ferrarese could hold the blood,\r    And weary who should weigh it ounce by ounce,\r\rOf which this courteous priest shall make a gift\r    To show himself a partisan; and such gifts\r    Will to the living of the land conform.\r\rAbove us there are mirrors, Thrones you call them,\r    From which shines out on us God Judicant,\r    So that this utterance seems good to us.\xc3\x93\r\rHere it was silent, and it had the semblance\r    Of being turned elsewhither, by the wheel\r    On which it entered as it was before.\r\rThe other joy, already known to me,\r    Became a thing transplendent in my sight,\r    As a fine ruby smitten by the sun.\r\rThrough joy effulgence is acquired above,\r    As here a smile; but down below, the shade\r    Outwardly darkens, as the mind is sad.\r\r\xc3\x92God seeth all things, and in Him, blest spirit,\r    Thy sight is,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92so that never will\r    Of his can possibly from thee be hidden;\r\rThy voice, then, that for ever makes the heavens\r    Glad, with the singing of those holy fires\r    Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl,\r\rWherefore does it not satisfy my longings?\r    Indeed, I would not wait thy questioning\r    If I in thee were as thou art in me.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92The greatest of the valleys where the water\r    Expands itself,\xc3\x93 forthwith its words began,\r    \xc3\x92That sea excepted which the earth engarlands,\r\rBetween discordant shores against the sun\r    Extends so far, that it meridian makes\r    Where it was wont before to make the horizon.\r\rI was a dweller on that valley\xc3\x95s shore\r    \xc3\x95Twixt Ebro and Magra that with journey short\r    Doth from the Tuscan part the Genoese.\r\rWith the same sunset and same sunrise nearly\r    Sit Buggia and the city whence I was,\r    That with its blood once made the harbour hot.\r\rFolco that people called me unto whom\r    My name was known; and now with me this heaven\r    Imprints itself, as I did once with it;\r\rFor more the daughter of Belus never burned,\r    Offending both Sichaeus and Creusa,\r    Than I, so long as it became my locks,\r\rNor yet that Rodophean, who deluded\r    was by Demophoon, nor yet Alcides,\r    When Iole he in his heart had locked.\r\rYet here is no repenting, but we smile,\r    Not at the fault, which comes not back to mind,\r    But at the power which ordered and foresaw.\r\rHere we behold the art that doth adorn\r    With such affection, and the good discover\r    Whereby the world above turns that below.\r\rBut that thou wholly satisfied mayst bear\r    Thy wishes hence which in this sphere are born,\r    Still farther to proceed behoveth me.\r\rThou fain wouldst know who is within this light\r    That here beside me thus is scintillating,\r    Even as a sunbeam in the limpid water.\r\rThen know thou, that within there is at rest\r    Rahab, and being to our order joined,\r    With her in its supremest grade \xc3\x95tis sealed.\r\rInto this heaven, where ends the shadowy cone\r    Cast by your world, before all other souls\r    First of Christ\xc3\x95s triumph was she taken up.\r\rFull meet it was to leave her in some heaven,\r    Even as a palm of the high victory\r    Which he acquired with one palm and the other,\r\rBecause she favoured the first glorious deed\r    Of Joshua upon the Holy Land,\r    That little stirs the memory of the Pope.\r\rThy city, which an offshoot is of him\r    Who first upon his Maker turned his back,\r    And whose ambition is so sorely wept,\r\rBrings forth and scatters the accursed flower\r    Which both the sheep and lambs hath led astray\r    Since it has turned the shepherd to a wolf.\r\rFor this the Evangel and the mighty Doctors\r    Are derelict, and only the Decretals\r    So studied that it shows upon their margins.\r\rOn this are Pope and Cardinals intent;\r    Their meditations reach not Nazareth,\r    There where his pinions Gabriel unfolded;\r\rBut Vatican and the other parts elect\r    Of Rome, which have a cemetery been\r    Unto the soldiery that followed Peter\r\rShall soon be free from this adultery.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto X\r\r\rLooking into his Son with all the Love\r    Which each of them eternally breathes forth,\r    The Primal and unutterable Power\r\rWhate\xc3\x95er before the mind or eye revolves\r    With so much order made, there can be none\r    Who this beholds without enjoying Him.\r\rLift up then, Reader, to the lofty wheels\r    With me thy vision straight unto that part\r    Where the one motion on the other strikes,\r\rAnd there begin to contemplate with joy\r    That Master\xc3\x95s art, who in himself so loves it\r    That never doth his eye depart therefrom.\r\rBehold how from that point goes branching off\r    The oblique circle, which conveys the planets,\r    To satisfy the world that calls upon them;\r\rAnd if their pathway were not thus inflected,\r    Much virtue in the heavens would be in vain,\r    And almost every power below here dead.\r\rIf from the straight line distant more or less\r    Were the departure, much would wanting be\r    Above and underneath of mundane order.\r\rRemain now, Reader, still upon thy bench,\r    In thought pursuing that which is foretasted,\r    If thou wouldst jocund be instead of weary.\r\rI\xc3\x95ve set before thee; henceforth feed thyself,\r    For to itself diverteth all my care\r    That theme whereof I have been made the scribe.\r\rThe greatest of the ministers of nature,\r    Who with the power of heaven the world imprints\r    And measures with his light the time for us,\r\rWith that part which above is called to mind\r    Conjoined, along the spirals was revolving,\r    Where each time earlier he presents himself;\r\rAnd I was with him; but of the ascending\r    I was not conscious, saving as a man\r    Of a first thought is conscious ere it come;\r\rAnd Beatrice, she who is seen to pass\r    From good to better, and so suddenly\r    That not by time her action is expressed,\r\rHow lucent in herself must she have been!\r    And what was in the sun, wherein I entered,\r    Apparent not by colour but by light,\r\rI, though I call on genius, art, and practice,\r    Cannot so tell that it could be imagined;\r    Believe one can, and let him long to see it.\r\rAnd if our fantasies too lowly are\r    For altitude so great, it is no marvel,\r    Since o\xc3\x95er the sun was never eye could go.\r\rSuch in this place was the fourth family\r    Of the high Father, who forever sates it,\r    Showing how he breathes forth and how begets.\r\rAnd Beatrice began: \xc3\x92Give thanks, give thanks\r    Unto the Sun of Angels, who to this\r    Sensible one has raised thee by his grace!\xc3\x93\r\rNever was heart of mortal so disposed\r    To worship, nor to give itself to God\r    With all its gratitude was it so ready,\r\rAs at those words did I myself become;\r    And all my love was so absorbed in Him,\r    That in oblivion Beatrice was eclipsed.\r\rNor this displeased her; but she smiled at it\r    So that the splendour of her laughing eyes\r    My single mind on many things divided.\r\rLights many saw I, vivid and triumphant,\r    Make us a centre and themselves a circle,\r    More sweet in voice than luminous in aspect.\r\rThus girt about the daughter of Latona\r    We sometimes see, when pregnant is the air,\r    So that it holds the thread which makes her zone.\r\rWithin the court of Heaven, whence I return,\r    Are many jewels found, so fair and precious\r    They cannot be transported from the realm;\r\rAnd of them was the singing of those lights.\r    Who takes not wings that he may fly up thither,\r    The tidings thence may from the dumb await!\r\rAs soon as singing thus those burning suns\r    Had round about us whirled themselves three times,\r    Like unto stars neighbouring the steadfast poles,\r\rLadies they seemed, not from the dance released,\r    But who stop short, in silence listening\r    Till they have gathered the new melody.\r\rAnd within one I heard beginning: \xc3\x92When\r    The radiance of grace, by which is kindled\r    True love, and which thereafter grows by loving,\r\rWithin thee multiplied is so resplendent\r    That it conducts thee upward by that stair,\r    Where without reascending none descends,\r\rWho should deny the wine out of his vial\r    Unto thy thirst, in liberty were not\r    Except as water which descends not seaward.\r\rFain wouldst thou know with what plants is enflowered\r    This garland that encircles with delight\r    The Lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven.\r\rOf the lambs was I of the holy flock\r    Which Dominic conducteth by a road\r    Where well one fattens if he strayeth not.\r\rHe who is nearest to me on the right\r    My brother and master was; and he Albertus\r    Is of Cologne, I Thomas of Aquinum.\r\rIf thou of all the others wouldst be certain,\r    Follow behind my speaking with thy sight\r    Upward along the blessed garland turning.\r\rThat next effulgence issues from the smile\r    Of Gratian, who assisted both the courts\r    In such wise that it pleased in Paradise.\r\rThe other which near by adorns our choir\r    That Peter was who, e\xc3\x95en as the poor widow,\r    Offered his treasure unto Holy Church.\r\rThe fifth light, that among us is the fairest,\r    Breathes forth from such a love, that all the world\r    Below is greedy to learn tidings of it.\r\rWithin it is the lofty mind, where knowledge\r    So deep was put, that, if the true be true,\r    To see so much there never rose a second.\r\rThou seest next the lustre of that taper,\r    Which in the flesh below looked most within\r    The angelic nature and its ministry.\r\rWithin that other little light is smiling\r    The advocate of the Christian centuries,\r    Out of whose rhetoric Augustine was furnished.\r\rNow if thou trainest thy mind\xc3\x95s eye along\r    From light to light pursuant of my praise,\r    With thirst already of the eighth thou waitest.\r\rBy seeing every good therein exults\r    The sainted soul, which the fallacious world\r    Makes manifest to him who listeneth well;\r\rThe body whence \xc3\x95twas hunted forth is lying\r    Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom\r    And banishment it came unto this peace.\r\rSee farther onward flame the burning breath\r    Of Isidore, of Beda, and of Richard\r    Who was in contemplation more than man.\r\rThis, whence to me returneth thy regard,\r    The light is of a spirit unto whom\r    In his grave meditations death seemed slow.\r\rIt is the light eternal of Sigier,\r    Who, reading lectures in the Street of Straw,\r    Did syllogize invidious verities.\xc3\x93\r\rThen, as a horologe that calleth us\r    What time the Bride of God is rising up\r    With matins to her Spouse that he may love her,\r\rWherein one part the other draws and urges,\r    Ting! ting! resounding with so sweet a note,\r    That swells with love the spirit well disposed,\r\rThus I beheld the glorious wheel move round,\r    And render voice to voice, in modulation\r    And sweetness that can not be comprehended,\r\rExcepting there where joy is made eternal.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XI\r\r\rO Thou insensate care of mortal men,\r    How inconclusive are the syllogisms\r    That make thee beat thy wings in downward flight!\r\rOne after laws and one to aphorisms\r    Was going, and one following the priesthood,\r    And one to reign by force or sophistry,\r\rAnd one in theft, and one in state affairs,\r    One in the pleasures of the flesh involved\r    Wearied himself, one gave himself to ease;\r\rWhen I, from all these things emancipate,\r    With Beatrice above there in the Heavens\r    With such exceeding glory was received!\r\rWhen each one had returned unto that point\r    Within the circle where it was before,\r    It stood as in a candlestick a candle;\r\rAnd from within the effulgence which at first\r    Had spoken unto me, I heard begin\r    Smiling while it more luminous became:\r\r\xc3\x92Even as I am kindled in its ray,\r    So, looking into the Eternal Light,\r    The occasion of thy thoughts I apprehend.\r\rThou doubtest, and wouldst have me to resift\r    In language so extended and so open\r    My speech, that to thy sense it may be plain,\r\rWhere just before I said, \xc3\x94where well one fattens,\xc3\x95\r    And where I said, \xc3\x94there never rose a second;\xc3\x95\r    And here \xc3\x95tis needful we distinguish well.\r\rThe Providence, which governeth the world\r    With counsel, wherein all created vision\r    Is vanquished ere it reach unto the bottom,\r\r(So that towards her own Beloved might go\r    The bride of Him who, uttering a loud cry,\r    Espoused her with his consecrated blood,\r\rSelf-confident and unto Him more faithful,)\r    Two Princes did ordain in her behoof,\r    Which on this side and that might be her guide.\r\rThe one was all seraphical in ardour;\r    The other by his wisdom upon earth\r    A splendour was of light cherubical.\r\rOne will I speak of, for of both is spoken\r    In praising one, whichever may be taken,\r    Because unto one end their labours were.\r\rBetween Tupino and the stream that falls\r    Down from the hill elect of blessed Ubald,\r    A fertile slope of lofty mountain hangs,\r\rFrom which Perugia feels the cold and heat\r    Through Porta Sole, and behind it weep\r    Gualdo and Nocera their grievous yoke.\r\rFrom out that slope, there where it breaketh most\r    Its steepness, rose upon the world a sun\r    As this one does sometimes from out the Ganges;\r\rTherefore let him who speaketh of that place,\r    Say not Ascesi, for he would say little,\r    But Orient, if he properly would speak.\r\rHe was not yet far distant from his rising\r    Before he had begun to make the earth\r    Some comfort from his mighty virtue feel.\r\rFor he in youth his father\xc3\x95s wrath incurred\r    For certain Dame, to whom, as unto death,\r    The gate of pleasure no one doth unlock;\r\rAnd was before his spiritual court\r    \xc3\x94Et coram patre\xc3\x95 unto her united;\r    Then day by day more fervently he loved her.\r\rShe, reft of her first husband, scorned, obscure,\r    One thousand and one hundred years and more,\r    Waited without a suitor till he came.\r\rNaught it availed to hear, that with Amyclas\r    Found her unmoved at sounding of his voice\r    He who struck terror into all the world;\r\rNaught it availed being constant and undaunted,\r    So that, when Mary still remained below,\r    She mounted up with Christ upon the cross.\r\rBut that too darkly I may not proceed,\r    Francis and Poverty for these two lovers\r    Take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse.\r\rTheir concord and their joyous semblances,\r    The love, the wonder, and the sweet regard,\r    They made to be the cause of holy thoughts;\r\rSo much so that the venerable Bernard\r    First bared his feet, and after so great peace\r    Ran, and, in running, thought himself too slow.\r\rO wealth unknown! O veritable good!\r    Giles bares his feet, and bares his feet Sylvester\r    Behind the bridegroom, so doth please the bride!\r\rThen goes his way that father and that master,\r    He and his Lady and that family\r    Which now was girding on the humble cord;\r\rNor cowardice of heart weighed down his brow\r    At being son of Peter Bernardone,\r    Nor for appearing marvellously scorned;\r\rBut regally his hard determination\r    To Innocent he opened, and from him\r    Received the primal seal upon his Order.\r\rAfter the people mendicant increased\r    Behind this man, whose admirable life\r    Better in glory of the heavens were sung,\r\rIncoronated with a second crown\r    Was through Honorius by the Eternal Spirit\r    The holy purpose of this Archimandrite.\r\rAnd when he had, through thirst of martyrdom,\r    In the proud presence of the Sultan preached\r    Christ and the others who came after him,\r\rAnd, finding for conversion too unripe\r    The folk, and not to tarry there in vain,\r    Returned to fruit of the Italic grass,\r\rOn the rude rock \xc3\x95twixt Tiber and the Arno\r    From Christ did he receive the final seal,\r    Which during two whole years his members bore.\r\rWhen He, who chose him unto so much good,\r    Was pleased to draw him up to the reward\r    That he had merited by being lowly,\r\rUnto his friars, as to the rightful heirs,\r    His most dear Lady did he recommend,\r    And bade that they should love her faithfully;\r\rAnd from her bosom the illustrious soul\r    Wished to depart, returning to its realm,\r    And for its body wished no other bier.\r\rThink now what man was he, who was a fit\r    Companion over the high seas to keep\r    The bark of Peter to its proper bearings.\r\rAnd this man was our Patriarch; hence whoever\r    Doth follow him as he commands can see\r    That he is laden with good merchandise.\r\rBut for new pasturage his flock has grown\r    So greedy, that it is impossible\r    They be not scattered over fields diverse;\r\rAnd in proportion as his sheep remote\r    And vagabond go farther off from him,\r    More void of milk return they to the fold.\r\rVerily some there are that fear a hurt,\r    And keep close to the shepherd; but so few,\r    That little cloth doth furnish forth their hoods.\r\rNow if my utterance be not indistinct,\r    If thine own hearing hath attentive been,\r    If thou recall to mind what I have said,\r\rIn part contented shall thy wishes be;\r    For thou shalt see the plant that\xc3\x95s chipped away,\r    And the rebuke that lieth in the words,\r\r\xc3\x94Where well one fattens, if he strayeth not.\xc3\x95\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XII\r\r\rSoon as the blessed flame had taken up\r    The final word to give it utterance,\r    Began the holy millstone to revolve,\r\rAnd in its gyre had not turned wholly round,\r    Before another in a ring enclosed it,\r    And motion joined to motion, song to song;\r\rSong that as greatly doth transcend our Muses,\r    Our Sirens, in those dulcet clarions,\r    As primal splendour that which is reflected.\r\rAnd as are spanned athwart a tender cloud\r    Two rainbows parallel and like in colour,\r    When Juno to her handmaid gives command,\r\r(The one without born of the one within,\r    Like to the speaking of that vagrant one\r    Whom love consumed as doth the sun the vapours,)\r\rAnd make the people here, through covenant\r    God set with Noah, presageful of the world\r    That shall no more be covered with a flood,\r\rIn such wise of those sempiternal roses\r    The garlands twain encompassed us about,\r    And thus the outer to the inner answered.\r\rAfter the dance, and other grand rejoicings,\r    Both of the singing, and the flaming forth\r    Effulgence with effulgence blithe and tender,\r\rTogether, at once, with one accord had stopped,\r    (Even as the eyes, that, as volition moves them,\r    Must needs together shut and lift themselves,)\r\rOut of the heart of one of the new lights\r    There came a voice, that needle to the star\r    Made me appear in turning thitherward.\r\rAnd it began: \xc3\x92The love that makes me fair\r    Draws me to speak about the other leader,\r    By whom so well is spoken here of mine.\r\r\xc3\x95Tis right, where one is, to bring in the other,\r    That, as they were united in their warfare,\r    Together likewise may their glory shine.\r\rThe soldiery of Christ, which it had cost\r    So dear to arm again, behind the standard\r    Moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few,\r\rWhen the Emperor who reigneth evermore\r    Provided for the host that was in peril,\r    Through grace alone and not that it was worthy;\r\rAnd, as was said, he to his Bride brought succour\r    With champions twain, at whose deed, at whose word\r    The straggling people were together drawn.\r\rWithin that region where the sweet west wind\r    Rises to open the new leaves, wherewith\r    Europe is seen to clothe herself afresh,\r\rNot far off from the beating of the waves,\r    Behind which in his long career the sun\r    Sometimes conceals himself from every man,\r\rIs situate the fortunate Calahorra,\r    Under protection of the mighty shield\r    In which the Lion subject is and sovereign.\r\rTherein was born the amorous paramour\r    Of Christian Faith, the athlete consecrate,\r    Kind to his own and cruel to his foes;\r\rAnd when it was created was his mind\r    Replete with such a living energy,\r    That in his mother her it made prophetic.\r\rAs soon as the espousals were complete\r    Between him and the Faith at holy font,\r    Where they with mutual safety dowered each other,\r\rThe woman, who for him had given assent,\r    Saw in a dream the admirable fruit\r    That issue would from him and from his heirs;\r\rAnd that he might be construed as he was,\r    A spirit from this place went forth to name him\r    With His possessive whose he wholly was.\r\rDominic was he called; and him I speak of\r    Even as of the husbandman whom Christ\r    Elected to his garden to assist him.\r\rEnvoy and servant sooth he seemed of Christ,\r    For the first love made manifest in him\r    Was the first counsel that was given by Christ.\r\rSilent and wakeful many a time was he\r    Discovered by his nurse upon the ground,\r    As if he would have said, \xc3\x94For this I came.\xc3\x95\r\rO thou his father, Felix verily!\r    O thou his mother, verily Joanna,\r    If this, interpreted, means as is said!\r\rNot for the world which people toil for now\r    In following Ostiense and Taddeo,\r    But through his longing after the true manna,\r\rHe in short time became so great a teacher,\r    That he began to go about the vineyard,\r    Which fadeth soon, if faithless be the dresser;\r\rAnd of the See, (that once was more benignant\r    Unto the righteous poor, not through itself,\r    But him who sits there and degenerates,)\r\rNot to dispense or two or three for six,\r    Not any fortune of first vacancy,\r    \xc3\x94Non decimas quae sunt pauperum Dei,\xc3\x95\r\rHe asked for, but against the errant world\r    Permission to do battle for the seed,\r    Of which these four and twenty plants surround thee.\r\rThen with the doctrine and the will together,\r    With office apostolical he moved,\r    Like torrent which some lofty vein out-presses;\r\rAnd in among the shoots heretical\r    His impetus with greater fury smote,\r    Wherever the resistance was the greatest.\r\rOf him were made thereafter divers runnels,\r    Whereby the garden catholic is watered,\r    So that more living its plantations stand.\r\rIf such the one wheel of the Biga was,\r    In which the Holy Church itself defended\r    And in the field its civic battle won,\r\rTruly full manifest should be to thee\r    The excellence of the other, unto whom\r    Thomas so courteous was before my coming.\r\rBut still the orbit, which the highest part\r    Of its circumference made, is derelict,\r    So that the mould is where was once the crust.\r\rHis family, that had straight forward moved\r    With feet upon his footprints, are turned round\r    So that they set the point upon the heel.\r\rAnd soon aware they will be of the harvest\r    Of this bad husbandry, when shall the tares\r    Complain the granary is taken from them.\r\rYet say I, he who searcheth leaf by leaf\r    Our volume through, would still some page discover\r    Where he could read, \xc3\x94I am as I am wont.\xc3\x95\r\r\xc3\x95Twill not be from Casal nor Acquasparta,\r    From whence come such unto the written word\r    That one avoids it, and the other narrows.\r\rBonaventura of Bagnoregio\xc3\x95s life\r    Am I, who always in great offices\r    Postponed considerations sinister.\r\rHere are Illuminato and Agostino,\r    Who of the first barefooted beggars were\r    That with the cord the friends of God became.\r\rHugh of Saint Victor is among them here,\r    And Peter Mangiador, and Peter of Spain,\r    Who down below in volumes twelve is shining;\r\rNathan the seer, and metropolitan\r    Chrysostom, and Anselmus, and Donatus\r    Who deigned to lay his hand to the first art;\r\rHere is Rabanus, and beside me here\r    Shines the Calabrian Abbot Joachim,\r    He with the spirit of prophecy endowed.\r\rTo celebrate so great a paladin\r    Have moved me the impassioned courtesy\r    And the discreet discourses of Friar Thomas,\r\rAnd with me they have moved this company.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XIII\r\r\rLet him imagine, who would well conceive\r    What now I saw, and let him while I speak\r    Retain the image as a steadfast rock,\r\rThe fifteen stars, that in their divers regions\r    The sky enliven with a light so great\r    That it transcends all clusters of the air;\r\rLet him the Wain imagine unto which\r    Our vault of heaven sufficeth night and day,\r    So that in turning of its pole it fails not;\r\rLet him the mouth imagine of the horn\r    That in the point beginneth of the axis\r    Round about which the primal wheel revolves,\xc3\x91\r\rTo have fashioned of themselves two signs in heaven,\r    Like unto that which Minos\xc3\x95 daughter made,\r    The moment when she felt the frost of death;\r\rAnd one to have its rays within the other,\r    And both to whirl themselves in such a manner\r    That one should forward go, the other backward;\r\rAnd he will have some shadowing forth of that\r    True constellation and the double dance\r    That circled round the point at which I was;\r\rBecause it is as much beyond our wont,\r    As swifter than the motion of the Chiana\r    Moveth the heaven that all the rest outspeeds.\r\rThere sang they neither Bacchus, nor Apollo,\r    But in the divine nature Persons three,\r    And in one person the divine and human.\r\rThe singing and the dance fulfilled their measure,\r    And unto us those holy lights gave need,\r    Growing in happiness from care to care.\r\rThen broke the silence of those saints concordant\r    The light in which the admirable life\r    Of God\xc3\x95s own mendicant was told to me,\r\rAnd said: \xc3\x92Now that one straw is trodden out\r    Now that its seed is garnered up already,\r    Sweet love invites me to thresh out the other.\r\rInto that bosom, thou believest, whence\r    Was drawn the rib to form the beauteous cheek\r    Whose taste to all the world is costing dear,\r\rAnd into that which, by the lance transfixed,\r    Before and since, such satisfaction made\r    That it weighs down the balance of all sin,\r\rWhate\xc3\x95er of light it has to human nature\r    Been lawful to possess was all infused\r    By the same power that both of them created;\r\rAnd hence at what I said above dost wonder,\r    When I narrated that no second had\r    The good which in the fifth light is enclosed.\r\rNow ope thine eyes to what I answer thee,\r    And thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse\r    Fit in the truth as centre in a circle.\r\rThat which can die, and that which dieth not,\r    Are nothing but the splendour of the idea\r    Which by his love our Lord brings into being;\r\rBecause that living Light, which from its fount\r    Effulgent flows, so that it disunites not\r    From Him nor from the Love in them intrined,\r\rThrough its own goodness reunites its rays\r    In nine subsistences, as in a mirror,\r    Itself eternally remaining One.\r\rThence it descends to the last potencies,\r    Downward from act to act becoming such\r    That only brief contingencies it makes;\r\rAnd these contingencies I hold to be\r    Things generated, which the heaven produces\r    By its own motion, with seed and without.\r\rNeither their wax, nor that which tempers it,\r    Remains immutable, and hence beneath\r    The ideal signet more and less shines through;\r\rTherefore it happens, that the selfsame tree\r    After its kind bears worse and better fruit,\r    And ye are born with characters diverse.\r\rIf in perfection tempered were the wax,\r    And were the heaven in its supremest virtue,\r    The brilliance of the seal would all appear;\r\rBut nature gives it evermore deficient,\r    In the like manner working as the artist,\r    Who has the skill of art and hand that trembles.\r\rIf then the fervent Love, the Vision clear,\r    Of primal Virtue do dispose and seal,\r    Perfection absolute is there acquired.\r\rThus was of old the earth created worthy\r    Of all and every animal perfection;\r    And thus the Virgin was impregnate made;\r\rSo that thine own opinion I commend,\r    That human nature never yet has been,\r    Nor will be, what it was in those two persons.\r\rNow if no farther forth I should proceed,\r    \xc3\x94Then in what way was he without a peer?\xc3\x95\r    Would be the first beginning of thy words.\r\rBut, that may well appear what now appears not,\r    Think who he was, and what occasion moved him\r    To make request, when it was told him, \xc3\x94Ask.\xc3\x95\r\rI\xc3\x95ve not so spoken that thou canst not see\r    Clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom,\r    That he might be sufficiently a king;\r\r\xc3\x95Twas not to know the number in which are\r    The motors here above, or if \xc3\x94necesse\xc3\x95\r    With a contingent e\xc3\x95er \xc3\x94necesse\xc3\x95 make,\r\r\xc3\x94Non si est dare primum motum esse,\xc3\x95\r    Or if in semicircle can be made\r    Triangle so that it have no right angle.\r\rWhence, if thou notest this and what I said,\r    A regal prudence is that peerless seeing\r    In which the shaft of my intention strikes.\r\rAnd if on \xc3\x94rose\xc3\x95 thou turnest thy clear eyes,\r    Thou\xc3\x95lt see that it has reference alone\r    To kings who\xc3\x95re many, and the good are rare.\r\rWith this distinction take thou what I said,\r    And thus it can consist with thy belief\r    Of the first father and of our Delight.\r\rAnd lead shall this be always to thy feet,\r    To make thee, like a weary man, move slowly\r    Both to the Yes and No thou seest not;\r\rFor very low among the fools is he\r    Who affirms without distinction, or denies,\r    As well in one as in the other case;\r\rBecause it happens that full often bends\r    Current opinion in the false direction,\r    And then the feelings bind the intellect.\r\rFar more than uselessly he leaves the shore,\r    (Since he returneth not the same he went,)\r    Who fishes for the truth, and has no skill;\r\rAnd in the world proofs manifest thereof\r    Parmenides, Melissus, Brissus are,\r    And many who went on and knew not whither;\r\rThus did Sabellius, Arius, and those fools\r    Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures\r    In rendering distorted their straight faces.\r\rNor yet shall people be too confident\r    In judging, even as he is who doth count\r    The corn in field or ever it be ripe.\r\rFor I have seen all winter long the thorn\r    First show itself intractable and fierce,\r    And after bear the rose upon its top;\r\rAnd I have seen a ship direct and swift\r    Run o\xc3\x95er the sea throughout its course entire,\r    To perish at the harbour\xc3\x95s mouth at last.\r\rLet not Dame Bertha nor Ser Martin think,\r    Seeing one steal, another offering make,\r    To see them in the arbitrament divine;\r\rFor one may rise, and fall the other may.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XIV\r\r\rFrom centre unto rim, from rim to centre,\r    In a round vase the water moves itself,\r    As from without \xc3\x95tis struck or from within.\r\rInto my mind upon a sudden dropped\r    What I am saying, at the moment when\r    Silent became the glorious life of Thomas,\r\rBecause of the resemblance that was born\r    Of his discourse and that of Beatrice,\r    Whom, after him, it pleased thus to begin:\r\r\xc3\x92This man has need (and does not tell you so,\r    Nor with the voice, nor even in his thought)\r    Of going to the root of one truth more.\r\rDeclare unto him if the light wherewith\r    Blossoms your substance shall remain with you\r    Eternally the same that it is now;\r\rAnd if it do remain, say in what manner,\r    After ye are again made visible,\r    It can be that it injure not your sight.\xc3\x93\r\rAs by a greater gladness urged and drawn\r    They who are dancing in a ring sometimes\r    Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;\r\rSo, at that orison devout and prompt,\r    The holy circles a new joy displayed\r    In their revolving and their wondrous song.\r\rWhoso lamenteth him that here we die\r    That we may live above, has never there\r    Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain.\r\rThe One and Two and Three who ever liveth,\r    And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,\r    Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,\r\rThree several times was chanted by each one\r    Among those spirits, with such melody\r    That for all merit it were just reward;\r\rAnd, in the lustre most divine of all\r    The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,\r    Such as perhaps the Angel\xc3\x95s was to Mary,\r\rAnswer: \xc3\x92As long as the festivity\r    Of Paradise shall be, so long our love\r    Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.\r\rIts brightness is proportioned to the ardour,\r    The ardour to the vision; and the vision\r    Equals what grace it has above its worth.\r\rWhen, glorious and sanctified, our flesh\r    Is reassumed, then shall our persons be\r    More pleasing by their being all complete;\r\rFor will increase whate\xc3\x95er bestows on us\r    Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,\r    Light which enables us to look on Him;\r\rTherefore the vision must perforce increase,\r    Increase the ardour which from that is kindled,\r    Increase the radiance which from this proceeds.\r\rBut even as a coal that sends forth flame,\r    And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it\r    So that its own appearance it maintains,\r\rThus the effulgence that surrounds us now\r    Shall be o\xc3\x95erpowered in aspect by the flesh,\r    Which still to-day the earth doth cover up;\r\rNor can so great a splendour weary us,\r    For strong will be the organs of the body\r    To everything which hath the power to please us.\xc3\x93\r\rSo sudden and alert appeared to me\r    Both one and the other choir to say Amen,\r    That well they showed desire for their dead bodies;\r\rNor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,\r    The fathers, and the rest who had been dear\r    Or ever they became eternal flames.\r\rAnd lo! all round about of equal brightness\r    Arose a lustre over what was there,\r    Like an horizon that is clearing up.\r\rAnd as at rise of early eve begin\r    Along the welkin new appearances,\r    So that the sight seems real and unreal,\r\rIt seemed to me that new subsistences\r    Began there to be seen, and make a circle\r    Outside the other two circumferences.\r\rO very sparkling of the Holy Spirit,\r    How sudden and incandescent it became\r    Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not!\r\rBut Beatrice so beautiful and smiling\r    Appeared to me, that with the other sights\r    That followed not my memory I must leave her.\r\rThen to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed\r    The power, and I beheld myself translated\r    To higher salvation with my Lady only.\r\rWell was I ware that I was more uplifted\r    By the enkindled smiling of the star,\r    That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont.\r\rWith all my heart, and in that dialect\r    Which is the same in all, such holocaust\r    To God I made as the new grace beseemed;\r\rAnd not yet from my bosom was exhausted\r    The ardour of sacrifice, before I knew\r    This offering was accepted and auspicious;\r\rFor with so great a lustre and so red\r    Splendours appeared to me in twofold rays,\r    I said: \xc3\x92O Helios who dost so adorn them!\xc3\x93\r\rEven as distinct with less and greater lights\r    Glimmers between the two poles of the world\r    The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt,\r\rThus constellated in the depths of Mars,\r    Those rays described the venerable sign\r    That quadrants joining in a circle make.\r\rHere doth my memory overcome my genius;\r    For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ,\r    So that I cannot find ensample worthy;\r\rBut he who takes his cross and follows Christ\r    Again will pardon me what I omit,\r    Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ.\r\rFrom horn to horn, and \xc3\x95twixt the top and base,\r    Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating\r    As they together met and passed each other;\r\rThus level and aslant and swift and slow\r    We here behold, renewing still the sight,\r    The particles of bodies long and short,\r\rAcross the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed\r    Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence\r    People with cunning and with art contrive.\r\rAnd as a lute and harp, accordant strung\r    With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make\r    To him by whom the notes are not distinguished,\r\rSo from the lights that there to me appeared\r    Upgathered through the cross a melody,\r    Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn.\r\rWell was I ware it was of lofty laud,\r    Because there came to me, \xc3\x92Arise and conquer!\xc3\x93\r    As unto him who hears and comprehends not.\r\rSo much enamoured I became therewith,\r    That until then there was not anything\r    That e\xc3\x95er had fettered me with such sweet bonds.\r\rPerhaps my word appears somewhat too bold,\r    Postponing the delight of those fair eyes,\r    Into which gazing my desire has rest;\r\rBut who bethinks him that the living seals\r    Of every beauty grow in power ascending,\r    And that I there had not turned round to those,\r\rCan me excuse, if I myself accuse\r    To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly:\r    For here the holy joy is not disclosed,\r\rBecause ascending it becomes more pure.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XV\r\r\rA will benign, in which reveals itself\r    Ever the love that righteously inspires,\r    As in the iniquitous, cupidity,\r\rSilence imposed upon that dulcet lyre,\r    And quieted the consecrated chords,\r    That Heaven\xc3\x95s right hand doth tighten and relax.\r\rHow unto just entreaties shall be deaf\r    Those substances, which, to give me desire\r    Of praying them, with one accord grew silent?\r\r\xc3\x95Tis well that without end he should lament,\r    Who for the love of thing that doth not last\r    Eternally despoils him of that love!\r\rAs through the pure and tranquil evening air\r    There shoots from time to time a sudden fire,\r    Moving the eyes that steadfast were before,\r\rAnd seems to be a star that changeth place,\r    Except that in the part where it is kindled\r    Nothing is missed, and this endureth little;\r\rSo from the horn that to the right extends\r    Unto that cross\xc3\x95s foot there ran a star\r    Out of the constellation shining there;\r\rNor was the gem dissevered from its ribbon,\r    But down the radiant fillet ran along,\r    So that fire seemed it behind alabaster.\r\rThus piteous did Anchises\xc3\x95 shade reach forward,\r    If any faith our greatest Muse deserve,\r    When in Elysium he his son perceived.\r\r\xc3\x92O sanguis meus, O superinfusa\r    Gratia Dei, sicut tibi, cui\r    Bis unquam Coeli janua reclusa?\xc3\x93\r\rThus that effulgence; whence I gave it heed;\r    Then round unto my Lady turned my sight,\r    And on this side and that was stupefied;\r\rFor in her eyes was burning such a smile\r    That with mine own methought I touched the bottom\r    Both of my grace and of my Paradise!\r\rThen, pleasant to the hearing and the sight,\r    The spirit joined to its beginning things\r    I understood not, so profound it spake;\r\rNor did it hide itself from me by choice,\r    But by necessity; for its conception\r    Above the mark of mortals set itself.\r\rAnd when the bow of burning sympathy\r    Was so far slackened, that its speech descended\r    Towards the mark of our intelligence,\r\rThe first thing that was understood by me\r    Was \xc3\x92Benedight be Thou, O Trine and One,\r    Who hast unto my seed so courteous been!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd it continued: \xc3\x92Hunger long and grateful,\r    Drawn from the reading of the mighty volume\r    Wherein is never changed the white nor dark,\r\rThou hast appeased, my son, within this light\r    In which I speak to thee, by grace of her\r    Who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee.\r\rThou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass\r    From Him who is the first, as from the unit,\r    If that be known, ray out the five and six;\r\rAnd therefore who I am thou askest not,\r    And why I seem more joyous unto thee\r    Than any other of this gladsome crowd.\r\rThou think\xc3\x95st the truth; because the small and great\r    Of this existence look into the mirror\r    Wherein, before thou think\xc3\x95st, thy thought thou showest.\r\rBut that the sacred love, in which I watch\r    With sight perpetual, and which makes me thirst\r    With sweet desire, may better be fulfilled,\r\rNow let thy voice secure and frank and glad\r    Proclaim the wishes, the desire proclaim,\r    To which my answer is decreed already.\xc3\x93\r\rTo Beatrice I turned me, and she heard\r    Before I spake, and smiled to me a sign,\r    That made the wings of my desire increase;\r\rThen in this wise began I: \xc3\x92Love and knowledge,\r    When on you dawned the first Equality,\r    Of the same weight for each of you became;\r\rFor in the Sun, which lighted you and burned\r    With heat and radiance, they so equal are,\r    That all similitudes are insufficient.\r\rBut among mortals will and argument,\r    For reason that to you is manifest,\r    Diversely feathered in their pinions are.\r\rWhence I, who mortal am, feel in myself\r    This inequality; so give not thanks,\r    Save in my heart, for this paternal welcome.\r\rTruly do I entreat thee, living topaz!\r    Set in this precious jewel as a gem,\r    That thou wilt satisfy me with thy name.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O leaf of mine, in whom I pleasure took\r    E\xc3\x95en while awaiting, I was thine own root!\xc3\x93\r    Such a beginning he in answer made me.\r\rThen said to me: \xc3\x92That one from whom is named\r    Thy race, and who a hundred years and more\r    Has circled round the mount on the first cornice,\r\rA son of mine and thy great-grandsire was;\r    Well it behoves thee that the long fatigue\r    Thou shouldst for him make shorter with thy works.\r\rFlorence, within the ancient boundary\r    From which she taketh still her tierce and nones,\r    Abode in quiet, temperate and chaste.\r\rNo golden chain she had, nor coronal,\r    Nor ladies shod with sandal shoon, nor girdle\r    That caught the eye more than the person did.\r\rNot yet the daughter at her birth struck fear\r    Into the father, for the time and dower\r    Did not o\xc3\x95errun this side or that the measure.\r\rNo houses had she void of families,\r    Not yet had thither come Sardanapalus\r    To show what in a chamber can be done;\r\rNot yet surpassed had Montemalo been\r    By your Uccellatojo, which surpassed\r    Shall in its downfall be as in its rise.\r\rBellincion Berti saw I go begirt\r    With leather and with bone, and from the mirror\r    His dame depart without a painted face;\r\rAnd him of Nerli saw, and him of Vecchio,\r    Contented with their simple suits of buff\r    And with the spindle and the flax their dames.\r\rO fortunate women! and each one was certain\r    Of her own burial-place, and none as yet\r    For sake of France was in her bed deserted.\r\rOne o\xc3\x95er the cradle kept her studious watch,\r    And in her lullaby the language used\r    That first delights the fathers and the mothers;\r\rAnother, drawing tresses from her distaff,\r    Told o\xc3\x95er among her family the tales\r    Of Trojans and of Fesole and Rome.\r\rAs great a marvel then would have been held\r    A Lapo Salterello, a Cianghella,\r    As Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.\r\rTo such a quiet, such a beautiful\r    Life of the citizen, to such a safe\r    Community, and to so sweet an inn,\r\rDid Mary give me, with loud cries invoked,\r    And in your ancient Baptistery at once\r    Christian and Cacciaguida I became.\r\rMoronto was my brother, and Eliseo;\r    From Val di Pado came to me my wife,\r    And from that place thy surname was derived.\r\rI followed afterward the Emperor Conrad,\r    And he begirt me of his chivalry,\r    So much I pleased him with my noble deeds.\r\rI followed in his train against that law\xc3\x95s\r    Iniquity, whose people doth usurp\r    Your just possession, through your Pastor\xc3\x95s fault.\r\rThere by that execrable race was I\r    Released from bonds of the fallacious world,\r    The love of which defileth many souls,\r\rAnd came from martyrdom unto this peace.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XVI\r\r\rO thou our poor nobility of blood,\r    If thou dost make the people glory in thee\r    Down here where our affection languishes,\r\rA marvellous thing it ne\xc3\x95er will be to me;\r    For there where appetite is not perverted,\r    I say in Heaven, of thee I made a boast!\r\rTruly thou art a cloak that quickly shortens,\r    So that unless we piece thee day by day\r    Time goeth round about thee with his shears!\r\rWith \xc3\x94You,\xc3\x95 which Rome was first to tolerate,\r    (Wherein her family less perseveres,)\r    Yet once again my words beginning made;\r\rWhence Beatrice, who stood somewhat apart,\r    Smiling, appeared like unto her who coughed\r    At the first failing writ of Guenever.\r\rAnd I began: \xc3\x92You are my ancestor,\r    You give to me all hardihood to speak,\r    You lift me so that I am more than I.\r\rSo many rivulets with gladness fill\r    My mind, that of itself it makes a joy\r    Because it can endure this and not burst.\r\rThen tell me, my beloved root ancestral,\r    Who were your ancestors, and what the years\r    That in your boyhood chronicled themselves?\r\rTell me about the sheepfold of Saint John,\r    How large it was, and who the people were\r    Within it worthy of the highest seats.\xc3\x93\r\rAs at the blowing of the winds a coal\r    Quickens to flame, so I beheld that light\r    Become resplendent at my blandishments.\r\rAnd as unto mine eyes it grew more fair,\r    With voice more sweet and tender, but not in\r    This modern dialect, it said to me:\r\r\xc3\x92From uttering of the \xc3\x94Ave,\xc3\x95 till the birth\r    In which my mother, who is now a saint,\r    Of me was lightened who had been her burden,\r\rUnto its Lion had this fire returned\r    Five hundred fifty times and thirty more,\r    To reinflame itself beneath his paw.\r\rMy ancestors and I our birthplace had\r    Where first is found the last ward of the city\r    By him who runneth in your annual game.\r\rSuffice it of my elders to hear this;\r    But who they were, and whence they thither came,\r    Silence is more considerate than speech.\r\rAll those who at that time were there between\r    Mars and the Baptist, fit for bearing arms,\r    Were a fifth part of those who now are living;\r\rBut the community, that now is mixed\r    With Campi and Certaldo and Figghine,\r    Pure in the lowest artisan was seen.\r\rO how much better \xc3\x95twere to have as neighbours\r    The folk of whom I speak, and at Galluzzo\r    And at Trespiano have your boundary,\r\rThan have them in the town, and bear the stench\r    Of Aguglione\xc3\x95s churl, and him of Signa\r    Who has sharp eyes for trickery already.\r\rHad not the folk, which most of all the world\r    Degenerates, been a step-dame unto Caesar,\r    But as a mother to her son benignant,\r\rSome who turn Florentines, and trade and discount,\r    Would have gone back again to Simifonte\r    There where their grandsires went about as beggars.\r\rAt Montemurlo still would be the Counts,\r    The Cerchi in the parish of Acone,\r    Perhaps in Valdigrieve the Buondelmonti.\r\rEver the intermingling of the people\r    Has been the source of malady in cities,\r    As in the body food it surfeits on;\r\rAnd a blind bull more headlong plunges down\r    Than a blind lamb; and very often cuts\r    Better and more a single sword than five.\r\rIf Luni thou regard, and Urbisaglia,\r    How they have passed away, and how are passing\r    Chiusi and Sinigaglia after them,\r\rTo hear how races waste themselves away,\r    Will seem to thee no novel thing nor hard,\r    Seeing that even cities have an end.\r\rAll things of yours have their mortality,\r    Even as yourselves; but it is hidden in some\r    That a long while endure, and lives are short;\r\rAnd as the turning of the lunar heaven\r    Covers and bares the shores without a pause,\r    In the like manner fortune does with Florence.\r\rTherefore should not appear a marvellous thing\r    What I shall say of the great Florentines\r    Of whom the fame is hidden in the Past.\r\rI saw the Ughi, saw the Catellini,\r    Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi,\r    Even in their fall illustrious citizens;\r\rAnd saw, as mighty as they ancient were,\r    With him of La Sannella him of Arca,\r    And Soldanier, Ardinghi, and Bostichi.\r\rNear to the gate that is at present laden\r    With a new felony of so much weight\r    That soon it shall be jetsam from the bark,\r\rThe Ravignani were, from whom descended\r    The County Guido, and whoe\xc3\x95er the name\r    Of the great Bellincione since hath taken.\r\rHe of La Pressa knew the art of ruling\r    Already, and already Galigajo\r    Had hilt and pommel gilded in his house.\r\rMighty already was the Column Vair,\r    Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifant, and Barucci,\r    And Galli, and they who for the bushel blush.\r\rThe stock from which were the Calfucci born\r    Was great already, and already chosen\r    To curule chairs the Sizii and Arrigucci.\r\rO how beheld I those who are undone\r    By their own pride! and how the Balls of Gold\r    Florence enflowered in all their mighty deeds!\r\rSo likewise did the ancestors of those\r    Who evermore, when vacant is your church,\r    Fatten by staying in consistory.\r\rThe insolent race, that like a dragon follows\r    Whoever flees, and unto him that shows\r    His teeth or purse is gentle as a lamb,\r\rAlready rising was, but from low people;\r    So that it pleased not Ubertin Donato\r    That his wife\xc3\x95s father should make him their kin.\r\rAlready had Caponsacco to the Market\r    From Fesole descended, and already\r    Giuda and Infangato were good burghers.\r\rI\xc3\x95ll tell a thing incredible, but true;\r    One entered the small circuit by a gate\r    Which from the Della Pera took its name!\r\rEach one that bears the beautiful escutcheon\r    Of the great baron whose renown and name\r    The festival of Thomas keepeth fresh,\r\rKnighthood and privilege from him received;\r    Though with the populace unites himself\r    To-day the man who binds it with a border.\r\rAlready were Gualterotti and Importuni;\r    And still more quiet would the Borgo be\r    If with new neighbours it remained unfed.\r\rThe house from which is born your lamentation,\r    Through just disdain that death among you brought\r    And put an end unto your joyous life,\r\rWas honoured in itself and its companions.\r    O Buondelmonte, how in evil hour\r    Thou fled\xc3\x95st the bridal at another\xc3\x95s promptings!\r\rMany would be rejoicing who are sad,\r    If God had thee surrendered to the Ema\r    The first time that thou camest to the city.\r\rBut it behoved the mutilated stone\r    Which guards the bridge, that Florence should provide\r    A victim in her latest hour of peace.\r\rWith all these families, and others with them,\r    Florence beheld I in so great repose,\r    That no occasion had she whence to weep;\r\rWith all these families beheld so just\r    And glorious her people, that the lily\r    Never upon the spear was placed reversed,\r\rNor by division was vermilion made.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XVII\r\r\rAs came to Clymene, to be made certain\r    Of that which he had heard against himself,\r    He who makes fathers chary still to children,\r\rEven such was I, and such was I perceived\r    By Beatrice and by the holy light\r    That first on my account had changed its place.\r\rTherefore my Lady said to me: \xc3\x92Send forth\r    The flame of thy desire, so that it issue\r    Imprinted well with the internal stamp;\r\rNot that our knowledge may be greater made\r    By speech of thine, but to accustom thee\r    To tell thy thirst, that we may give thee drink.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O my beloved tree, (that so dost lift thee,\r    That even as minds terrestrial perceive\r    No triangle containeth two obtuse,\r\rSo thou beholdest the contingent things\r    Ere in themselves they are, fixing thine eyes\r    Upon the point in which all times are present,)\r\rWhile I was with Virgilius conjoined\r    Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal,\r    And when descending into the dead world,\r\rWere spoken to me of my future life\r    Some grievous words; although I feel myself\r    In sooth foursquare against the blows of chance.\r\rOn this account my wish would be content\r    To hear what fortune is approaching me,\r    Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly.\xc3\x93\r\rThus did I say unto that selfsame light\r    That unto me had spoken before; and even\r    As Beatrice willed was my own will confessed.\r\rNot in vague phrase, in which the foolish folk\r    Ensnared themselves of old, ere yet was slain\r    The Lamb of God who taketh sins away,\r\rBut with clear words and unambiguous\r    Language responded that paternal love,\r    Hid and revealed by its own proper smile:\r\r\xc3\x92Contingency, that outside of the volume\r    Of your materiality extends not,\r    Is all depicted in the eternal aspect.\r\rNecessity however thence it takes not,\r    Except as from the eye, in which \xc3\x95tis mirrored,\r    A ship that with the current down descends.\r\rFrom thence, e\xc3\x95en as there cometh to the ear\r    Sweet harmony from an organ, comes in sight\r    To me the time that is preparing for thee.\r\rAs forth from Athens went Hippolytus,\r    By reason of his step-dame false and cruel,\r    So thou from Florence must perforce depart.\r\rAlready this is willed, and this is sought for;\r    And soon it shall be done by him who thinks it,\r    Where every day the Christ is bought and sold.\r\rThe blame shall follow the offended party\r    In outcry as is usual; but the vengeance\r    Shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it.\r\rThou shalt abandon everything beloved\r    Most tenderly, and this the arrow is\r    Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth.\r\rThou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt\r    The bread of others, and how hard a road\r    The going down and up another\xc3\x95s stairs.\r\rAnd that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders\r    Will be the bad and foolish company\r    With which into this valley thou shalt fall;\r\rFor all ingrate, all mad and impious\r    Will they become against thee; but soon after\r    They, and not thou, shall have the forehead scarlet.\r\rOf their bestiality their own proceedings\r    Shall furnish proof; so \xc3\x95twill be well for thee\r    A party to have made thee by thyself.\r\rThine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn\r    Shall be the mighty Lombard\xc3\x95s courtesy,\r    Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird,\r\rWho such benign regard shall have for thee\r    That \xc3\x95twixt you twain, in doing and in asking,\r    That shall be first which is with others last.\r\rWith him shalt thou see one who at his birth\r    Has by this star of strength been so impressed,\r    That notable shall his achievements be.\r\rNot yet the people are aware of him\r    Through his young age, since only nine years yet\r    Around about him have these wheels revolved.\r\rBut ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry,\r    Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear\r    In caring not for silver nor for toil.\r\rSo recognized shall his magnificence\r    Become hereafter, that his enemies\r    Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it.\r\rOn him rely, and on his benefits;\r    By him shall many people be transformed,\r    Changing condition rich and mendicant;\r\rAnd written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear\r    Of him, but shalt not say it\xc3\x93\xc3\x91and things said he\r    Incredible to those who shall be present.\r\rThen added: \xc3\x92Son, these are the commentaries\r    On what was said to thee; behold the snares\r    That are concealed behind few revolutions;\r\rYet would I not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy,\r    Because thy life into the future reaches\r    Beyond the punishment of their perfidies.\xc3\x93\r\rWhen by its silence showed that sainted soul\r    That it had finished putting in the woof\r    Into that web which I had given it warped,\r\rBegan I, even as he who yearneth after,\r    Being in doubt, some counsel from a person\r    Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves:\r\r\xc3\x92Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on\r    The time towards me such a blow to deal me\r    As heaviest is to him who most gives way.\r\rTherefore with foresight it is well I arm me,\r    That, if the dearest place be taken from me,\r    I may not lose the others by my songs.\r\rDown through the world of infinite bitterness,\r    And o\xc3\x95er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit\r    The eyes of my own Lady lifted me,\r\rAnd afterward through heaven from light to light,\r    I have learned that which, if I tell again,\r    Will be a savour of strong herbs to many.\r\rAnd if I am a timid friend to truth,\r    I fear lest I may lose my life with those\r    Who will hereafter call this time the olden.\xc3\x93\r\rThe light in which was smiling my own treasure\r    Which there I had discovered, flashed at first\r    As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror;\r\rThen made reply: \xc3\x92A conscience overcast\r    Or with its own or with another\xc3\x95s shame,\r    Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word;\r\rBut ne\xc3\x95ertheless, all falsehood laid aside,\r    Make manifest thy vision utterly,\r    And let them scratch wherever is the itch;\r\rFor if thine utterance shall offensive be\r    At the first taste, a vital nutriment\r    \xc3\x95Twill leave thereafter, when it is digested.\r\rThis cry of thine shall do as doth the wind,\r    Which smiteth most the most exalted summits,\r    And that is no slight argument of honour.\r\rTherefore are shown to thee within these wheels,\r    Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley,\r    Only the souls that unto fame are known;\r\rBecause the spirit of the hearer rests not,\r    Nor doth confirm its faith by an example\r    Which has the root of it unknown and hidden,\r\rOr other reason that is not apparent.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XVIII\r\r\rNow was alone rejoicing in its word\r    That soul beatified, and I was tasting\r    My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,\r\rAnd the Lady who to God was leading me\r    Said: \xc3\x92Change thy thought; consider that I am\r    Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens.\xc3\x93\r\rUnto the loving accents of my comfort\r    I turned me round, and then what love I saw\r    Within those holy eyes I here relinquish;\r\rNot only that my language I distrust,\r    But that my mind cannot return so far\r    Above itself, unless another guide it.\r\rThus much upon that point can I repeat,\r    That, her again beholding, my affection\r    From every other longing was released.\r\rWhile the eternal pleasure, which direct\r    Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face\r    Contented me with its reflected aspect,\r\rConquering me with the radiance of a smile,\r    She said to me, \xc3\x92Turn thee about and listen;\r    Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as sometimes here do we behold\r    The affection in the look, if it be such\r    That all the soul is wrapt away by it,\r\rSo, by the flaming of the effulgence holy\r    To which I turned, I recognized therein\r    The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.\r\rAnd it began: \xc3\x92In this fifth resting-place\r    Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,\r    And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,\r\rAre blessed spirits that below, ere yet\r    They came to Heaven, were of such great renown\r    That every Muse therewith would affluent be.\r\rTherefore look thou upon the cross\xc3\x95s horns;\r    He whom I now shall name will there enact\r    What doth within a cloud its own swift fire.\xc3\x93\r\rI saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn\r    By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)\r    Nor noted I the word before the deed;\r\rAnd at the name of the great Maccabee\r    I saw another move itself revolving,\r    And gladness was the whip unto that top.\r\rLikewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,\r    Two of them my regard attentive followed\r    As followeth the eye its falcon flying.\r\rWilliam thereafterward, and Renouard,\r    And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight\r    Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.\r\rThen, moved and mingled with the other lights,\r    The soul that had addressed me showed how great\r    An artist \xc3\x95twas among the heavenly singers.\r\rTo my right side I turned myself around,\r    My duty to behold in Beatrice\r    Either by words or gesture signified;\r\rAnd so translucent I beheld her eyes,\r    So full of pleasure, that her countenance\r    Surpassed its other and its latest wont.\r\rAnd as, by feeling greater delectation,\r    A man in doing good from day to day\r    Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,\r\rSo I became aware that my gyration\r    With heaven together had increased its arc,\r    That miracle beholding more adorned.\r\rAnd such as is the change, in little lapse\r    Of time, in a pale woman, when her face\r    Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,\r\rSuch was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,\r    Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,\r    The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.\r\rWithin that Jovial torch did I behold\r    The sparkling of the love which was therein\r    Delineate our language to mine eyes.\r\rAnd even as birds uprisen from the shore,\r    As in congratulation o\xc3\x95er their food,\r    Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,\r\rSo from within those lights the holy creatures\r    Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures\r    Made of themselves now D, now I, now L.\r\rFirst singing they to their own music moved;\r    Then one becoming of these characters,\r    A little while they rested and were silent.\r\rO divine Pegasea, thou who genius\r    Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,\r    And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,\r\rIllume me with thyself, that I may bring\r    Their figures out as I have them conceived!\r    Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!\r\rThemselves then they displayed in five times seven\r    Vowels and consonants; and I observed\r    The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.\r\r\xc3\x94Diligite justitiam,\xc3\x95 these were\r    First verb and noun of all that was depicted;\r    \xc3\x94Qui judicatis terram\xc3\x95 were the last.\r\rThereafter in the M of the fifth word\r    Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter\r    Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.\r\rAnd other lights I saw descend where was\r    The summit of the M, and pause there singing\r    The good, I think, that draws them to itself.\r\rThen, as in striking upon burning logs\r    Upward there fly innumerable sparks,\r    Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,\r\rMore than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,\r    And to ascend, some more, and others less,\r    Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;\r\rAnd, each one being quiet in its place,\r    The head and neck beheld I of an eagle\r    Delineated by that inlaid fire.\r\rHe who there paints has none to be his guide;\r    But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered\r    That virtue which is form unto the nest.\r\rThe other beatitude, that contented seemed\r    At first to bloom a lily on the M,\r    By a slight motion followed out the imprint.\r\rO gentle star! what and how many gems\r    Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice\r    Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!\r\rWherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin\r    Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard\r    Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;\r\rSo that a second time it now be wroth\r    With buying and with selling in the temple\r    Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!\r\rO soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate,\r    Implore for those who are upon the earth\r    All gone astray after the bad example!\r\rOnce \xc3\x95twas the custom to make war with swords;\r    But now \xc3\x95tis made by taking here and there\r    The bread the pitying Father shuts from none.\r\rYet thou, who writest but to cancel, think\r    That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard\r    Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!\r\rWell canst thou say: \xc3\x92So steadfast my desire\r    Is unto him who willed to live alone,\r    And for a dance was led to martyrdom,\r\rThat I know not the Fisherman nor Paul.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XIX\r\r\rAppeared before me with its wings outspread\r    The beautiful image that in sweet fruition\r    Made jubilant the interwoven souls;\r\rAppeared a little ruby each, wherein\r    Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled\r    That each into mine eyes refracted it.\r\rAnd what it now behoves me to retrace\r    Nor voice has e\xc3\x95er reported, nor ink written,\r    Nor was by fantasy e\xc3\x95er comprehended;\r\rFor speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,\r    And utter with its voice both \xc3\x94I\xc3\x95 and \xc3\x94My,\xc3\x95\r    When in conception it was \xc3\x94We\xc3\x95 and \xc3\x94Our.\xc3\x95\r\rAnd it began: \xc3\x92Being just and merciful\r    Am I exalted here unto that glory\r    Which cannot be exceeded by desire;\r\rAnd upon earth I left my memory\r    Such, that the evil-minded people there\r    Commend it, but continue not the story.\xc3\x93\r\rSo doth a single heat from many embers\r    Make itself felt, even as from many loves\r    Issued a single sound from out that image.\r\rWhence I thereafter: \xc3\x92O perpetual flowers\r    Of the eternal joy, that only one\r    Make me perceive your odours manifold,\r\rExhaling, break within me the great fast\r    Which a long season has in hunger held me,\r    Not finding for it any food on earth.\r\rWell do I know, that if in heaven its mirror\r    Justice Divine another realm doth make,\r    Yours apprehends it not through any veil.\r\rYou know how I attentively address me\r    To listen; and you know what is the doubt\r    That is in me so very old a fast.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as a falcon, issuing from his hood,\r    Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,\r    Showing desire, and making himself fine,\r\rSaw I become that standard, which of lauds\r    Was interwoven of the grace divine,\r    With such songs as he knows who there rejoices.\r\rThen it began: \xc3\x92He who a compass turned\r    On the world\xc3\x95s outer verge, and who within it\r    Devised so much occult and manifest,\r\rCould not the impress of his power so make\r    On all the universe, as that his Word\r    Should not remain in infinite excess.\r\rAnd this makes certain that the first proud being,\r    Who was the paragon of every creature,\r    By not awaiting light fell immature.\r\rAnd hence appears it, that each minor nature\r    Is scant receptacle unto that good\r    Which has no end, and by itself is measured.\r\rIn consequence our vision, which perforce\r    Must be some ray of that intelligence\r    With which all things whatever are replete,\r\rCannot in its own nature be so potent,\r    That it shall not its origin discern\r    Far beyond that which is apparent to it.\r\rTherefore into the justice sempiternal\r    The power of vision that your world receives,\r    As eye into the ocean, penetrates;\r\rWhich, though it see the bottom near the shore,\r    Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet\r    \xc3\x95Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth.\r\rThere is no light but comes from the serene\r    That never is o\xc3\x95ercast, nay, it is darkness\r    Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.\r\rAmply to thee is opened now the cavern\r    Which has concealed from thee the living justice\r    Of which thou mad\xc3\x95st such frequent questioning.\r\rFor saidst thou: \xc3\x94Born a man is on the shore\r    Of Indus, and is none who there can speak\r    Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;\r\rAnd all his inclinations and his actions\r    Are good, so far as human reason sees,\r    Without a sin in life or in discourse:\r\rHe dieth unbaptised and without faith;\r    Where is this justice that condemneth him?\r    Where is his fault, if he do not believe?\xc3\x95\r\rNow who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit\r    In judgment at a thousand miles away,\r    With the short vision of a single span?\r\rTruly to him who with me subtilizes,\r    If so the Scripture were not over you,\r    For doubting there were marvellous occasion.\r\rO animals terrene, O stolid minds,\r    The primal will, that in itself is good,\r    Ne\xc3\x95er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved.\r\rSo much is just as is accordant with it;\r    No good created draws it to itself,\r    But it, by raying forth, occasions that.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as above her nest goes circling round\r    The stork when she has fed her little ones,\r    And he who has been fed looks up at her,\r\rSo lifted I my brows, and even such\r    Became the blessed image, which its wings\r    Was moving, by so many counsels urged.\r\rCircling around it sang, and said: \xc3\x92As are\r    My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them,\r    Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals.\xc3\x93\r\rThose lucent splendours of the Holy Spirit\r    Grew quiet then, but still within the standard\r    That made the Romans reverend to the world.\r\rIt recommenced: \xc3\x92Unto this kingdom never\r    Ascended one who had not faith in Christ,\r    Before or since he to the tree was nailed.\r\rBut look thou, many crying are, \xc3\x94Christ, Christ!\xc3\x95\r    Who at the judgment shall be far less near\r    To him than some shall be who knew not Christ.\r\rSuch Christians shall the Ethiop condemn,\r    When the two companies shall be divided,\r    The one for ever rich, the other poor.\r\rWhat to your kings may not the Persians say,\r    When they that volume opened shall behold\r    In which are written down all their dispraises?\r\rThere shall be seen, among the deeds of Albert,\r    That which ere long shall set the pen in motion,\r    For which the realm of Prague shall be deserted.\r\rThere shall be seen the woe that on the Seine\r    He brings by falsifying of the coin,\r    Who by the blow of a wild boar shall die.\r\rThere shall be seen the pride that causes thirst,\r    Which makes the Scot and Englishman so mad\r    That they within their boundaries cannot rest;\r\rBe seen the luxury and effeminate life\r    Of him of Spain, and the Bohemian,\r    Who valour never knew and never wished;\r\rBe seen the Cripple of Jerusalem,\r    His goodness represented by an I,\r    While the reverse an M shall represent;\r\rBe seen the avarice and poltroonery\r    Of him who guards the Island of the Fire,\r    Wherein Anchises finished his long life;\r\rAnd to declare how pitiful he is\r    Shall be his record in contracted letters\r    Which shall make note of much in little space.\r\rAnd shall appear to each one the foul deeds\r    Of uncle and of brother who a nation\r    So famous have dishonoured, and two crowns.\r\rAnd he of Portugal and he of Norway\r    Shall there be known, and he of Rascia too,\r    Who saw in evil hour the coin of Venice.\r\rO happy Hungary, if she let herself\r    Be wronged no farther! and Navarre the happy,\r    If with the hills that gird her she be armed!\r\rAnd each one may believe that now, as hansel\r    Thereof, do Nicosia and Famagosta\r    Lament and rage because of their own beast,\r\rWho from the others\xc3\x95 flank departeth not.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XX\r\r\rWhen he who all the world illuminates\r    Out of our hemisphere so far descends\r    That on all sides the daylight is consumed,\r\rThe heaven, that erst by him alone was kindled,\r    Doth suddenly reveal itself again\r    By many lights, wherein is one resplendent.\r\rAnd came into my mind this act of heaven,\r    When the ensign of the world and of its leaders\r    Had silent in the blessed beak become;\r\rBecause those living luminaries all,\r    By far more luminous, did songs begin\r    Lapsing and falling from my memory.\r\rO gentle Love, that with a smile dost cloak thee,\r    How ardent in those sparks didst thou appear,\r    That had the breath alone of holy thoughts!\r\rAfter the precious and pellucid crystals,\r    With which begemmed the sixth light I beheld,\r    Silence imposed on the angelic bells,\r\rI seemed to hear the murmuring of a river\r    That clear descendeth down from rock to rock,\r    Showing the affluence of its mountain-top.\r\rAnd as the sound upon the cithern\xc3\x95s neck\r    Taketh its form, and as upon the vent\r    Of rustic pipe the wind that enters it,\r\rEven thus, relieved from the delay of waiting,\r    That murmuring of the eagle mounted up\r    Along its neck, as if it had been hollow.\r\rThere it became a voice, and issued thence\r    From out its beak, in such a form of words\r    As the heart waited for wherein I wrote them.\r\r\xc3\x92The part in me which sees and bears the sun\r    In mortal eagles,\xc3\x93 it began to me,\r    \xc3\x92Now fixedly must needs be looked upon;\r\rFor of the fires of which I make my figure,\r    Those whence the eye doth sparkle in my head\r    Of all their orders the supremest are.\r\rHe who is shining in the midst as pupil\r    Was once the singer of the Holy Spirit,\r    Who bore the ark from city unto city;\r\rNow knoweth he the merit of his song,\r    In so far as effect of his own counsel,\r    By the reward which is commensurate.\r\rOf five, that make a circle for my brow,\r    He that approacheth nearest to my beak\r    Did the poor widow for her son console;\r\rNow knoweth he how dearly it doth cost\r    Not following Christ, by the experience\r    Of this sweet life and of its opposite.\r\rHe who comes next in the circumference\r    Of which I speak, upon its highest arc,\r    Did death postpone by penitence sincere;\r\rNow knoweth he that the eternal judgment\r    Suffers no change, albeit worthy prayer\r    Maketh below to-morrow of to-day.\r\rThe next who follows, with the laws and me,\r    Under the good intent that bore bad fruit\r    Became a Greek by ceding to the pastor;\r\rNow knoweth he how all the ill deduced\r    From his good action is not harmful to him,\r    Although the world thereby may be destroyed.\r\rAnd he, whom in the downward arc thou seest,\r    Guglielmo was, whom the same land deplores\r    That weepeth Charles and Frederick yet alive;\r\rNow knoweth he how heaven enamoured is\r    With a just king; and in the outward show\r    Of his effulgence he reveals it still.\r\rWho would believe, down in the errant world,\r    That e\xc3\x95er the Trojan Ripheus in this round\r    Could be the fifth one of the holy lights?\r\rNow knoweth he enough of what the world\r    Has not the power to see of grace divine,\r    Although his sight may not discern the bottom.\xc3\x93\r\rLike as a lark that in the air expatiates,\r    First singing and then silent with content\r    Of the last sweetness that doth satisfy her,\r\rSuch seemed to me the image of the imprint\r    Of the eternal pleasure, by whose will\r    Doth everything become the thing it is.\r\rAnd notwithstanding to my doubt I was\r    As glass is to the colour that invests it,\r    To wait the time in silence it endured not,\r\rBut forth from out my mouth, \xc3\x92What things are these?\xc3\x93\r    Extorted with the force of its own weight;\r    Whereat I saw great joy of coruscation.\r\rThereafterward with eye still more enkindled\r    The blessed standard made to me reply,\r    To keep me not in wonderment suspended:\r\r\xc3\x92I see that thou believest in these things\r    Because I say them, but thou seest not how;\r    So that, although believed in, they are hidden.\r\rThou doest as he doth who a thing by name\r    Well apprehendeth, but its quiddity\r    Cannot perceive, unless another show it.\r\r\xc3\x94Regnum coelorum\xc3\x95 suffereth violence\r    From fervent love, and from that living hope\r    That overcometh the Divine volition;\r\rNot in the guise that man o\xc3\x95ercometh man,\r    But conquers it because it will be conquered,\r    And conquered conquers by benignity.\r\rThe first life of the eyebrow and the fifth\r    Cause thee astonishment, because with them\r    Thou seest the region of the angels painted.\r\rThey passed not from their bodies, as thou thinkest,\r    Gentiles, but Christians in the steadfast faith\r    Of feet that were to suffer and had suffered.\r\rFor one from Hell, where no one e\xc3\x95er turns back\r    Unto good will, returned unto his bones,\r    And that of living hope was the reward,\xc3\x91\r\rOf living hope, that placed its efficacy\r    In prayers to God made to resuscitate him,\r    So that \xc3\x95twere possible to move his will.\r\rThe glorious soul concerning which I speak,\r    Returning to the flesh, where brief its stay,\r    Believed in Him who had the power to aid it;\r\rAnd, in believing, kindled to such fire\r    Of genuine love, that at the second death\r    Worthy it was to come unto this joy.\r\rThe other one, through grace, that from so deep\r    A fountain wells that never hath the eye\r    Of any creature reached its primal wave,\r\rSet all his love below on righteousness;\r    Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose\r    His eye to our redemption yet to be,\r\rWhence he believed therein, and suffered not\r    From that day forth the stench of paganism,\r    And he reproved therefor the folk perverse.\r\rThose Maidens three, whom at the right-hand wheel\r    Thou didst behold, were unto him for baptism\r    More than a thousand years before baptizing.\r\rO thou predestination, how remote\r    Thy root is from the aspect of all those\r    Who the First Cause do not behold entire!\r\rAnd you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained\r    In judging; for ourselves, who look on God,\r    We do not know as yet all the elect;\r\rAnd sweet to us is such a deprivation,\r    Because our good in this good is made perfect,\r    That whatsoe\xc3\x95er God wills, we also will.\xc3\x93\r\rAfter this manner by that shape divine,\r    To make clear in me my short-sightedness,\r    Was given to me a pleasant medicine;\r\rAnd as good singer a good lutanist\r    Accompanies with vibrations of the chords,\r    Whereby more pleasantness the song acquires,\r\rSo, while it spake, do I remember me\r    That I beheld both of those blessed lights,\r    Even as the winking of the eyes concords,\r\rMoving unto the words their little flames.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXI\r\r\rAlready on my Lady\xc3\x95s face mine eyes\r    Again were fastened, and with these my mind,\r    And from all other purpose was withdrawn;\r\rAnd she smiled not; but \xc3\x92If I were to smile,\xc3\x93\r    She unto me began, \xc3\x92thou wouldst become\r    Like Semele, when she was turned to ashes.\r\rBecause my beauty, that along the stairs\r    Of the eternal palace more enkindles,\r    As thou hast seen, the farther we ascend,\r\rIf it were tempered not, is so resplendent\r    That all thy mortal power in its effulgence\r    Would seem a leaflet that the thunder crushes.\r\rWe are uplifted to the seventh splendour,\r    That underneath the burning Lion\xc3\x95s breast\r    Now radiates downward mingled with his power.\r\rFix in direction of thine eyes the mind,\r    And make of them a mirror for the figure\r    That in this mirror shall appear to thee.\xc3\x93\r\rHe who could know what was the pasturage\r    My sight had in that blessed countenance,\r    When I transferred me to another care,\r\rWould recognize how grateful was to me\r    Obedience unto my celestial escort,\r    By counterpoising one side with the other.\r\rWithin the crystal which, around the world\r    Revolving, bears the name of its dear leader,\r    Under whom every wickedness lay dead,\r\rColoured like gold, on which the sunshine gleams,\r    A stairway I beheld to such a height\r    Uplifted, that mine eye pursued it not.\r\rLikewise beheld I down the steps descending\r    So many splendours, that I thought each light\r    That in the heaven appears was there diffused.\r\rAnd as accordant with their natural custom\r    The rooks together at the break of day\r    Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold;\r\rThen some of them fly off without return,\r    Others come back to where they started from,\r    And others, wheeling round, still keep at home;\r\rSuch fashion it appeared to me was there\r    Within the sparkling that together came,\r    As soon as on a certain step it struck,\r\rAnd that which nearest unto us remained\r    Became so clear, that in my thought I said,\r    \xc3\x92Well I perceive the love thou showest me;\r\rBut she, from whom I wait the how and when\r    Of speech and silence, standeth still; whence I\r    Against desire do well if I ask not.\xc3\x93\r\rShe thereupon, who saw my silentness\r    In the sight of Him who seeth everything,\r    Said unto me, \xc3\x92Let loose thy warm desire.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I began: \xc3\x92No merit of my own\r    Renders me worthy of response from thee;\r    But for her sake who granteth me the asking,\r\rThou blessed life that dost remain concealed\r    In thy beatitude, make known to me\r    The cause which draweth thee so near my side;\r\rAnd tell me why is silent in this wheel\r    The dulcet symphony of Paradise,\r    That through the rest below sounds so devoutly.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight,\xc3\x93\r    It answer made to me; \xc3\x92they sing not here,\r    For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled.\r\rThus far adown the holy stairway\xc3\x95s steps\r    Have I descended but to give thee welcome\r    With words, and with the light that mantles me;\r\rNor did more love cause me to be more ready,\r    For love as much and more up there is burning,\r    As doth the flaming manifest to thee.\r\rBut the high charity, that makes us servants\r    Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,\r    Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92I see full well,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92O sacred lamp!\r    How love unfettered in this court sufficeth\r    To follow the eternal Providence;\r\rBut this is what seems hard for me to see,\r    Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone\r    Unto this office from among thy consorts.\xc3\x93\r\rNo sooner had I come to the last word,\r    Than of its middle made the light a centre,\r    Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.\r\rWhen answer made the love that was therein:\r    \xc3\x92On me directed is a light divine,\r    Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,\r\rOf which the virtue with my sight conjoined\r    Lifts me above myself so far, I see\r    The supreme essence from which this is drawn.\r\rHence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,\r    For to my sight, as far as it is clear,\r    The clearness of the flame I equal make.\r\rBut that soul in the heaven which is most pure,\r    That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,\r    Could this demand of thine not satisfy;\r\rBecause so deeply sinks in the abyss\r    Of the eternal statute what thou askest,\r    From all created sight it is cut off.\r\rAnd to the mortal world, when thou returnest,\r    This carry back, that it may not presume\r    Longer tow\xc3\x95rd such a goal to move its feet.\r\rThe mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke;\r    From this observe how can it do below\r    That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?\xc3\x93\r\rSuch limit did its words prescribe to me,\r    The question I relinquished, and restricted\r    Myself to ask it humbly who it was.\r\r\xc3\x92Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs,\r    And not far distant from thy native place,\r    So high, the thunders far below them sound,\r\rAnd form a ridge that Catria is called,\r    \xc3\x95Neath which is consecrate a hermitage\r    Wont to be dedicate to worship only.\xc3\x93\r\rThus unto me the third speech recommenced,\r    And then, continuing, it said: \xc3\x92Therein\r    Unto God\xc3\x95s service I became so steadfast,\r\rThat feeding only on the juice of olives\r    Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,\r    Contented in my thoughts contemplative.\r\rThat cloister used to render to these heavens\r    Abundantly, and now is empty grown,\r    So that perforce it soon must be revealed.\r\rI in that place was Peter Damiano;\r    And Peter the Sinner was I in the house\r    Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.\r\rLittle of mortal life remained to me,\r    When I was called and dragged forth to the hat\r    Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.\r\rCame Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came\r    Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,\r    Taking the food of any hostelry.\r\rNow some one to support them on each side\r    The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,\r    So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.\r\rThey cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,\r    So that two beasts go underneath one skin;\r    O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!\xc3\x93\r\rAt this voice saw I many little flames\r    From step to step descending and revolving,\r    And every revolution made them fairer.\r\rRound about this one came they and stood still,\r    And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,\r    It here could find no parallel, nor I\r\rDistinguished it, the thunder so o\xc3\x95ercame me.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXII\r\r\rOppressed with stupor, I unto my guide\r    Turned like a little child who always runs\r    For refuge there where he confideth most;\r\rAnd she, even as a mother who straightway\r    Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy\r    With voice whose wont it is to reassure him,\r\rSaid to me: \xc3\x92Knowest thou not thou art in heaven,\r    And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all\r    And what is done here cometh from good zeal?\r\rAfter what wise the singing would have changed thee\r    And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine,\r    Since that the cry has startled thee so much,\r\rIn which if thou hadst understood its prayers\r    Already would be known to thee the vengeance\r    Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest.\r\rThe sword above here smiteth not in haste\r    Nor tardily, howe\xc3\x95er it seem to him\r    Who fearing or desiring waits for it.\r\rBut turn thee round towards the others now,\r    For very illustrious spirits shalt thou see,\r    If thou thy sight directest as I say.\xc3\x93\r\rAs it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,\r    And saw a hundred spherules that together\r    With mutual rays each other more embellished.\r\rI stood as one who in himself represses\r    The point of his desire, and ventures not\r    To question, he so feareth the too much.\r\rAnd now the largest and most luculent\r    Among those pearls came forward, that it might\r    Make my desire concerning it content.\r\rWithin it then I heard: \xc3\x92If thou couldst see\r    Even as myself the charity that burns\r    Among us, thy conceits would be expressed;\r\rBut, that by waiting thou mayst not come late\r    To the high end, I will make answer even\r    Unto the thought of which thou art so chary.\r\rThat mountain on whose slope Cassino stands\r    Was frequented of old upon its summit\r    By a deluded folk and ill-disposed;\r\rAnd I am he who first up thither bore\r    The name of Him who brought upon the earth\r    The truth that so much sublimateth us.\r\rAnd such abundant grace upon me shone\r    That all the neighbouring towns I drew away\r    From the impious worship that seduced the world.\r\rThese other fires, each one of them, were men\r    Contemplative, enkindled by that heat\r    Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up.\r\rHere is Macarius, here is Romualdus,\r    Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters\r    Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to him: \xc3\x92The affection which thou showest\r    Speaking with me, and the good countenance\r    Which I behold and note in all your ardours,\r\rIn me have so my confidence dilated\r    As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes\r    As far unfolded as it hath the power.\r\rTherefore I pray, and thou assure me, father,\r    If I may so much grace receive, that I\r    May thee behold with countenance unveiled.\xc3\x93\r\rHe thereupon: \xc3\x92Brother, thy high desire\r    In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled,\r    Where are fulfilled all others and my own.\r\rThere perfect is, and ripened, and complete,\r    Every desire; within that one alone\r    Is every part where it has always been;\r\rFor it is not in space, nor turns on poles,\r    And unto it our stairway reaches up,\r    Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away.\r\rUp to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it\r    Extending its supernal part, what time\r    So thronged with angels it appeared to him.\r\rBut to ascend it now no one uplifts\r    His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule\r    Below remaineth for mere waste of paper.\r\rThe walls that used of old to be an Abbey\r    Are changed to dens of robbers, and the cowls\r    Are sacks filled full of miserable flour.\r\rBut heavy usury is not taken up\r    So much against God\xc3\x95s pleasure as that fruit\r    Which maketh so insane the heart of monks;\r\rFor whatsoever hath the Church in keeping\r    Is for the folk that ask it in God\xc3\x95s name,\r    Not for one\xc3\x95s kindred or for something worse.\r\rThe flesh of mortals is so very soft,\r    That good beginnings down below suffice not\r    From springing of the oak to bearing acorns.\r\rPeter began with neither gold nor silver,\r    And I with orison and abstinence,\r    And Francis with humility his convent.\r\rAnd if thou lookest at each one\xc3\x95s beginning,\r    And then regardest whither he has run,\r    Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown.\r\rIn verity the Jordan backward turned,\r    And the sea\xc3\x95s fleeing, when God willed were more\r    A wonder to behold, than succour here.\xc3\x93\r\rThus unto me he said; and then withdrew\r    To his own band, and the band closed together;\r    Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt.\r\rThe gentle Lady urged me on behind them\r    Up o\xc3\x95er that stairway by a single sign,\r    So did her virtue overcome my nature;\r\rNor here below, where one goes up and down\r    By natural law, was motion e\xc3\x95er so swift\r    That it could be compared unto my wing.\r\rReader, as I may unto that devout\r    Triumph return, on whose account I often\r    For my transgressions weep and beat my breast,\xc3\x91\r\rThou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire\r    And drawn it out again, before I saw\r    The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it.\r\rO glorious stars, O light impregnated\r    With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge\r    All of my genius, whatsoe\xc3\x95er it be,\r\rWith you was born, and hid himself with you,\r    He who is father of all mortal life,\r    When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;\r\rAnd then when grace was freely given to me\r    To enter the high wheel which turns you round,\r    Your region was allotted unto me.\r\rTo you devoutly at this hour my soul\r    Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire\r    For the stern pass that draws it to itself.\r\r\xc3\x92Thou art so near unto the last salvation,\xc3\x93\r    Thus Beatrice began, \xc3\x92thou oughtest now\r    To have thine eves unclouded and acute;\r\rAnd therefore, ere thou enter farther in,\r    Look down once more, and see how vast a world\r    Thou hast already put beneath thy feet;\r\rSo that thy heart, as jocund as it may,\r    Present itself to the triumphant throng\r    That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether.\xc3\x93\r\rI with my sight returned through one and all\r    The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe\r    Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance;\r\rAnd that opinion I approve as best\r    Which doth account it least; and he who thinks\r    Of something else may truly be called just.\r\rI saw the daughter of Latona shining\r    Without that shadow, which to me was cause\r    That once I had believed her rare and dense.\r\rThe aspect of thy son, Hyperion,\r    Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves\r    Around and near him Maia and Dione.\r\rThence there appeared the temperateness of Jove\r    \xc3\x95Twixt son and father, and to me was clear\r    The change that of their whereabout they make;\r\rAnd all the seven made manifest to me\r    How great they are, and eke how swift they are,\r    And how they are in distant habitations.\r\rThe threshing-floor that maketh us so proud,\r    To me revolving with the eternal Twins,\r    Was all apparent made from hill to harbour!\r\rThen to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXIII\r\r\rEven as a bird, \xc3\x95mid the beloved leaves,\r    Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood\r    Throughout the night, that hideth all things from us,\r\rWho, that she may behold their longed-for looks\r    And find the food wherewith to nourish them,\r    In which, to her, grave labours grateful are,\r\rAnticipates the time on open spray\r    And with an ardent longing waits the sun,\r    Gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn:\r\rEven thus my Lady standing was, erect\r    And vigilant, turned round towards the zone\r    Underneath which the sun displays less haste;\r\rSo that beholding her distraught and wistful,\r    Such I became as he is who desiring\r    For something yearns, and hoping is appeased.\r\rBut brief the space from one When to the other;\r    Of my awaiting, say I, and the seeing\r    The welkin grow resplendent more and more.\r\rAnd Beatrice exclaimed: \xc3\x92Behold the hosts\r    Of Christ\xc3\x95s triumphal march, and all the fruit\r    Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!\xc3\x93\r\rIt seemed to me her face was all aflame;\r    And eyes she had so full of ecstasy\r    That I must needs pass on without describing.\r\rAs when in nights serene of the full moon\r    Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal\r    Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs,\r\rSaw I, above the myriads of lamps,\r    A Sun that one and all of them enkindled,\r    E\xc3\x95en as our own doth the supernal sights,\r\rAnd through the living light transparent shone\r    The lucent substance so intensely clear\r    Into my sight, that I sustained it not.\r\rO Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear!\r    To me she said: \xc3\x92What overmasters thee\r    A virtue is from which naught shields itself.\r\rThere are the wisdom and the omnipotence\r    That oped the thoroughfares \xc3\x95twixt heaven and earth,\r    For which there erst had been so long a yearning.\xc3\x93\r\rAs fire from out a cloud unlocks itself,\r    Dilating so it finds not room therein,\r    And down, against its nature, falls to earth,\r\rSo did my mind, among those aliments\r    Becoming larger, issue from itself,\r    And that which it became cannot remember.\r\r\xc3\x92Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:\r    Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough\r    Hast thou become to tolerate my smile.\xc3\x93\r\rI was as one who still retains the feeling\r    Of a forgotten vision, and endeavours\r    In vain to bring it back into his mind,\r\rWhen I this invitation heard, deserving\r    Of so much gratitude, it never fades\r    Out of the book that chronicles the past.\r\rIf at this moment sounded all the tongues\r    That Polyhymnia and her sisters made\r    Most lubrical with their delicious milk,\r\rTo aid me, to a thousandth of the truth\r    It would not reach, singing the holy smile\r    And how the holy aspect it illumed.\r\rAnd therefore, representing Paradise,\r    The sacred poem must perforce leap over,\r    Even as a man who finds his way cut off;\r\rBut whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,\r    And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,\r    Should blame it not, if under this it tremble.\r\rIt is no passage for a little boat\r    This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,\r    Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.\r\r\xc3\x92Why doth my face so much enamour thee,\r    That to the garden fair thou turnest not,\r    Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?\r\rThere is the Rose in which the Word Divine\r    Became incarnate; there the lilies are\r    By whose perfume the good way was discovered.\xc3\x93\r\rThus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels\r    Was wholly ready, once again betook me\r    Unto the battle of the feeble brows.\r\rAs in the sunshine, that unsullied streams\r    Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers\r    Mine eyes with shadow covered o\xc3\x95er have seen,\r\rSo troops of splendours manifold I saw\r    Illumined from above with burning rays,\r    Beholding not the source of the effulgence.\r\rO power benignant that dost so imprint them!\r    Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope\r    There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough.\r\rThe name of that fair flower I e\xc3\x95er invoke\r    Morning and evening utterly enthralled\r    My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.\r\rAnd when in both mine eyes depicted were\r    The glory and greatness of the living star\r    Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,\r\rAthwart the heavens a little torch descended\r    Formed in a circle like a coronal,\r    And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it.\r\rWhatever melody most sweetly soundeth\r    On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,\r    Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,\r\rCompared unto the sounding of that lyre\r    Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,\r    Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.\r\r\xc3\x92I am Angelic Love, that circle round\r    The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb\r    That was the hostelry of our Desire;\r\rAnd I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while\r    Thou followest thy Son, and mak\xc3\x95st diviner\r    The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there.\xc3\x93\r\rThus did the circulated melody\r    Seal itself up; and all the other lights\r    Were making to resound the name of Mary.\r\rThe regal mantle of the volumes all\r    Of that world, which most fervid is and living\r    With breath of God and with his works and ways,\r\rExtended over us its inner border,\r    So very distant, that the semblance of it\r    There where I was not yet appeared to me.\r\rTherefore mine eyes did not possess the power\r    Of following the incoronated flame,\r    Which mounted upward near to its own seed.\r\rAnd as a little child, that towards its mother\r    Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,\r    Through impulse kindled into outward flame,\r\rEach of those gleams of whiteness upward reached\r    So with its summit, that the deep affection\r    They had for Mary was revealed to me.\r\rThereafter they remained there in my sight,\r    \xc3\x94Regina coeli\xc3\x95 singing with such sweetness,\r    That ne\xc3\x95er from me has the delight departed.\r\rO, what exuberance is garnered up\r    Within those richest coffers, which had been\r    Good husbandmen for sowing here below!\r\rThere they enjoy and live upon the treasure\r    Which was acquired while weeping in the exile\r    Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left.\r\rThere triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son\r    Of God and Mary, in his victory,\r    Both with the ancient council and the new,\r\rHe who doth keep the keys of such a glory.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXIV\r\r\r\xc3\x92O company elect to the great supper\r    Of the Lamb benedight, who feedeth you\r    So that for ever full is your desire,\r\rIf by the grace of God this man foretaste\r    Something of that which falleth from your table,\r    Or ever death prescribe to him the time,\r\rDirect your mind to his immense desire,\r    And him somewhat bedew; ye drinking are\r    For ever at the fount whence comes his thought.\xc3\x93\r\rThus Beatrice; and those souls beatified\r    Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,\r    Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.\r\rAnd as the wheels in works of horologes\r    Revolve so that the first to the beholder\r    Motionless seems, and the last one to fly,\r\rSo in like manner did those carols, dancing\r    In different measure, of their affluence\r    Give me the gauge, as they were swift or slow.\r\rFrom that one which I noted of most beauty\r    Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy\r    That none it left there of a greater brightness;\r\rAnd around Beatrice three several times\r    It whirled itself with so divine a song,\r    My fantasy repeats it not to me;\r\rTherefore the pen skips, and I write it not,\r    Since our imagination for such folds,\r    Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring.\r\r\xc3\x92O holy sister mine, who us implorest\r    With such devotion, by thine ardent love\r    Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!\xc3\x93\r\rThereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire\r    Unto my Lady did direct its breath,\r    Which spake in fashion as I here have said.\r\rAnd she: \xc3\x92O light eterne of the great man\r    To whom our Lord delivered up the keys\r    He carried down of this miraculous joy,\r\rThis one examine on points light and grave,\r    As good beseemeth thee, about the Faith\r    By means of which thou on the sea didst walk.\r\rIf he love well, and hope well, and believe,\r    From thee \xc3\x95tis hid not; for thou hast thy sight\r    There where depicted everything is seen.\r\rBut since this kingdom has made citizens\r    By means of the true Faith, to glorify it\r    \xc3\x95Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof.\xc3\x93\r\rAs baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not\r    Until the master doth propose the question,\r    To argue it, and not to terminate it,\r\rSo did I arm myself with every reason,\r    While she was speaking, that I might be ready\r    For such a questioner and such profession.\r\r\xc3\x92Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;\r    What is the Faith?\xc3\x93 Whereat I raised my brow\r    Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.\r\rThen turned I round to Beatrice, and she\r    Prompt signals made to me that I should pour\r    The water forth from my internal fountain.\r\r\xc3\x92May grace, that suffers me to make confession,\xc3\x93\r    Began I, \xc3\x92to the great centurion,\r    Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I continued: \xc3\x92As the truthful pen,\r    Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it,\r    Who put with thee Rome into the good way,\r\rFaith is the substance of the things we hope for,\r    And evidence of those that are not seen;\r    And this appears to me its quiddity.\xc3\x93\r\rThen heard I: \xc3\x92Very rightly thou perceivest,\r    If well thou understandest why he placed it\r    With substances and then with evidences.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I thereafterward: \xc3\x92The things profound,\r    That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,\r    Unto all eyes below are so concealed,\r\rThat they exist there only in belief,\r    Upon the which is founded the high hope,\r    And hence it takes the nature of a substance.\r\rAnd it behoveth us from this belief\r    To reason without having other sight,\r    And hence it has the nature of evidence.\xc3\x93\r\rThen heard I: \xc3\x92If whatever is acquired\r    Below by doctrine were thus understood,\r    No sophist\xc3\x95s subtlety would there find place.\xc3\x93\r\rThus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;\r    Then added: \xc3\x92Very well has been gone over\r    Already of this coin the alloy and weight;\r\rBut tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?\xc3\x93\r    And I: \xc3\x92Yes, both so shining and so round\r    That in its stamp there is no peradventure.\xc3\x93\r\rThereafter issued from the light profound\r    That there resplendent was: \xc3\x92This precious jewel,\r    Upon the which is every virtue founded,\r\rWhence hadst thou it?\xc3\x93 And I: \xc3\x92The large outpouring\r    Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused\r    Upon the ancient parchments and the new,\r\rA syllogism is, which proved it to me\r    With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,\r    All demonstration seems to me obtuse.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd then I heard: \xc3\x92The ancient and the new\r    Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,\r    Why dost thou take them for the word divine?\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92The proofs, which show the truth to me,\r    Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature\r    Ne\xc3\x95er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x95Twas answered me: \xc3\x92Say, who assureth thee\r    That those works ever were? the thing itself\r    That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92Were the world to Christianity converted,\xc3\x93\r    I said, \xc3\x92withouten miracles, this one\r    Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;\r\rBecause that poor and fasting thou didst enter\r    Into the field to sow there the good plant,\r    Which was a vine and has become a thorn!\xc3\x93\r\rThis being finished, the high, holy Court\r    Resounded through the spheres, \xc3\x92One God we praise!\xc3\x93\r    In melody that there above is chanted.\r\rAnd then that Baron, who from branch to branch,\r    Examining, had thus conducted me,\r    Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,\r\rAgain began: \xc3\x92The Grace that dallying\r    Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,\r    Up to this point, as it should opened be,\r\rSo that I do approve what forth emerged;\r    But now thou must express what thou believest,\r    And whence to thy belief it was presented.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92O holy father, spirit who beholdest\r    What thou believedst so that thou o\xc3\x95ercamest,\r    Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,\xc3\x93\r\rBegan I, \xc3\x92thou dost wish me in this place\r    The form to manifest of my prompt belief,\r    And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.\r\rAnd I respond: In one God I believe,\r    Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens\r    With love and with desire, himself unmoved;\r\rAnd of such faith not only have I proofs\r    Physical and metaphysical, but gives them\r    Likewise the truth that from this place rains down\r\rThrough Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,\r    Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote\r    After the fiery Spirit sanctified you;\r\rIn Persons three eterne believe, and these\r    One essence I believe, so one and trine\r    They bear conjunction both with \xc3\x94sunt\xc3\x95 and \xc3\x94est.\xc3\x95\r\rWith the profound condition and divine\r    Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind\r    Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.\r\rThis the beginning is, this is the spark\r    Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,\r    And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as a lord who hears what pleaseth him\r    His servant straight embraces, gratulating\r    For the good news as soon as he is silent;\r\rSo, giving me its benediction, singing,\r    Three times encircled me, when I was silent,\r    The apostolic light, at whose command\r\rI spoken had, in speaking I so pleased him.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXV\r\r\rIf e\xc3\x95er it happen that the Poem Sacred,\r    To which both heaven and earth have set their hand,\r    So that it many a year hath made me lean,\r\rO\xc3\x95ercome the cruelty that bars me out\r    From the fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered,\r    An enemy to the wolves that war upon it,\r\rWith other voice forthwith, with other fleece\r    Poet will I return, and at my font\r    Baptismal will I take the laurel crown;\r\rBecause into the Faith that maketh known\r    All souls to God there entered I, and then\r    Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled.\r\rThereafterward towards us moved a light\r    Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits\r    Which of his vicars Christ behind him left,\r\rAnd then my Lady, full of ecstasy,\r    Said unto me: \xc3\x92Look, look! behold the Baron\r    For whom below Galicia is frequented.\xc3\x93\r\rIn the same way as, when a dove alights\r    Near his companion, both of them pour forth,\r    Circling about and murmuring, their affection,\r\rSo one beheld I by the other grand\r    Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,\r    Lauding the food that there above is eaten.\r\rBut when their gratulations were complete,\r    Silently \xc3\x94coram me\xc3\x95 each one stood still,\r    So incandescent it o\xc3\x95ercame my sight.\r\rSmiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:\r    \xc3\x92Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions\r    Of our Basilica have been described,\r\rMake Hope resound within this altitude;\r    Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it\r    As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness.\xc3\x93\xc3\x91\r\r\xc3\x92Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;\r    For what comes hither from the mortal world\r    Must needs be ripened in our radiance.\xc3\x93\r\rThis comfort came to me from the second fire;\r    Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,\r    Which bent them down before with too great weight.\r\r\xc3\x92Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou\r    Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,\r    In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,\r\rSo that, the truth beholden of this court,\r    Hope, which below there rightfully enamours,\r    Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others,\r\rSay what it is, and how is flowering with it\r    Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee.\xc3\x93\r    Thus did the second light again continue.\r\rAnd the Compassionate, who piloted\r    The plumage of my wings in such high flight,\r    Did in reply anticipate me thus:\r\r\xc3\x92No child whatever the Church Militant\r    Of greater hope possesses, as is written\r    In that Sun which irradiates all our band;\r\rTherefore it is conceded him from Egypt\r    To come into Jerusalem to see,\r    Or ever yet his warfare be completed.\r\rThe two remaining points, that not for knowledge\r    Have been demanded, but that he report\r    How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,\r\rTo him I leave; for hard he will not find them,\r    Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;\r    And may the grace of God in this assist him!\xc3\x93\r\rAs a disciple, who his teacher follows,\r    Ready and willing, where he is expert,\r    That his proficiency may be displayed,\r\r\xc3\x92Hope,\xc3\x93 said I, \xc3\x92is the certain expectation\r    Of future glory, which is the effect\r    Of grace divine and merit precedent.\r\rFrom many stars this light comes unto me;\r    But he instilled it first into my heart\r    Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.\r\r\xc3\x94Sperent in te,\xc3\x95 in the high Theody\r    He sayeth, \xc3\x94those who know thy name;\xc3\x95 and who\r    Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?\r\rThou didst instil me, then, with his instilling\r    In the Epistle, so that I am full,\r    And upon others rain again your rain.\xc3\x93\r\rWhile I was speaking, in the living bosom\r    Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,\r    Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;\r\rThen breathed: \xc3\x92The love wherewith I am inflamed\r    Towards the virtue still which followed me\r    Unto the palm and issue of the field,\r\rWills that I breathe to thee that thou delight\r    In her; and grateful to me is thy telling\r    Whatever things Hope promises to thee.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92The ancient Scriptures and the new\r    The mark establish, and this shows it me,\r    Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.\r\rIsaiah saith, that each one garmented\r    In his own land shall be with twofold garments,\r    And his own land is this delightful life.\r\rThy brother, too, far more explicitly,\r    There where he treateth of the robes of white,\r    This revelation manifests to us.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd first, and near the ending of these words,\r    \xc3\x92Sperent in te\xc3\x93 from over us was heard,\r    To which responsive answered all the carols.\r\rThereafterward a light among them brightened,\r    So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,\r    Winter would have a month of one sole day.\r\rAnd as uprises, goes, and enters the dance\r    A winsome maiden, only to do honour\r    To the new bride, and not from any failing,\r\rEven thus did I behold the brightened splendour\r    Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved\r    As was beseeming to their ardent love.\r\rInto the song and music there it entered;\r    And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,\r    Even as a bride silent and motionless.\r\r\xc3\x92This is the one who lay upon the breast\r    Of him our Pelican; and this is he\r    To the great office from the cross elected.\xc3\x93\r\rMy Lady thus; but therefore none the more\r    Did move her sight from its attentive gaze\r    Before or afterward these words of hers.\r\rEven as a man who gazes, and endeavours\r    To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,\r    And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,\r\rSo I became before that latest fire,\r    While it was said, \xc3\x92Why dost thou daze thyself\r    To see a thing which here hath no existence?\r\rEarth in the earth my body is, and shall be\r    With all the others there, until our number\r    With the eternal proposition tallies.\r\rWith the two garments in the blessed cloister\r    Are the two lights alone that have ascended:\r    And this shalt thou take back into your world.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd at this utterance the flaming circle\r    Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling\r    Of sound that by the trinal breath was made,\r\rAs to escape from danger or fatigue\r    The oars that erst were in the water beaten\r    Are all suspended at a whistle\xc3\x95s sound.\r\rAh, how much in my mind was I disturbed,\r    When I turned round to look on Beatrice,\r    That her I could not see, although I was\r\rClose at her side and in the Happy World!\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXVI\r\r\rWhile I was doubting for my vision quenched,\r    Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it\r    Issued a breathing, that attentive made me,\r\rSaying: \xc3\x92While thou recoverest the sense\r    Of seeing which in me thou hast consumed,\r    \xc3\x95Tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it.\r\rBegin then, and declare to what thy soul\r    Is aimed, and count it for a certainty,\r    Sight is in thee bewildered and not dead;\r\rBecause the Lady, who through this divine\r    Region conducteth thee, has in her look\r    The power the hand of Ananias had.\xc3\x93\r\rI said: \xc3\x92As pleaseth her, or soon or late\r    Let the cure come to eyes that portals were\r    When she with fire I ever burn with entered.\r\rThe Good, that gives contentment to this Court,\r    The Alpha and Omega is of all\r    The writing that love reads me low or loud.\xc3\x93\r\rThe selfsame voice, that taken had from me\r    The terror of the sudden dazzlement,\r    To speak still farther put it in my thought;\r\rAnd said: \xc3\x92In verity with finer sieve\r    Behoveth thee to sift; thee it behoveth\r    To say who aimed thy bow at such a target.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I: \xc3\x92By philosophic arguments,\r    And by authority that hence descends,\r    Such love must needs imprint itself in me;\r\rFor Good, so far as good, when comprehended\r    Doth straight enkindle love, and so much greater\r    As more of goodness in itself it holds;\r\rThen to that Essence (whose is such advantage\r    That every good which out of it is found\r    Is nothing but a ray of its own light)\r\rMore than elsewhither must the mind be moved\r    Of every one, in loving, who discerns\r    The truth in which this evidence is founded.\r\rSuch truth he to my intellect reveals\r    Who demonstrates to me the primal love\r    Of all the sempiternal substances.\r\rThe voice reveals it of the truthful Author,\r    Who says to Moses, speaking of Himself,\r    \xc3\x94I will make all my goodness pass before thee.\xc3\x95\r\rThou too revealest it to me, beginning\r    The loud Evangel, that proclaims the secret\r    Of heaven to earth above all other edict.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I heard say: \xc3\x92By human intellect\r    And by authority concordant with it,\r    Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest.\r\rBut say again if other cords thou feelest,\r    Draw thee towards Him, that thou mayst proclaim\r    With how many teeth this love is biting thee.\xc3\x93\r\rThe holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ\r    Not latent was, nay, rather I perceived\r    Whither he fain would my profession lead.\r\rTherefore I recommenced: \xc3\x92All of those bites\r    Which have the power to turn the heart to God\r    Unto my charity have been concurrent.\r\rThe being of the world, and my own being,\r    The death which He endured that I may live,\r    And that which all the faithful hope, as I do,\r\rWith the forementioned vivid consciousness\r    Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse,\r    And of the right have placed me on the shore.\r\rThe leaves, wherewith embowered is all the garden\r    Of the Eternal Gardener, do I love\r    As much as he has granted them of good.\xc3\x93\r\rAs soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet\r    Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady\r    Said with the others, \xc3\x92Holy, holy, holy!\xc3\x93\r\rAnd as at some keen light one wakes from sleep\r    By reason of the visual spirit that runs\r    Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat,\r\rAnd he who wakes abhorreth what he sees,\r    So all unconscious is his sudden waking,\r    Until the judgment cometh to his aid,\r\rSo from before mine eyes did Beatrice\r    Chase every mote with radiance of her own,\r    That cast its light a thousand miles and more.\r\rWhence better after than before I saw,\r    And in a kind of wonderment I asked\r    About a fourth light that I saw with us.\r\rAnd said my Lady: \xc3\x92There within those rays\r    Gazes upon its Maker the first soul\r    That ever the first virtue did create.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as the bough that downward bends its top\r    At transit of the wind, and then is lifted\r    By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,\r\rLikewise did I, the while that she was speaking,\r    Being amazed, and then I was made bold\r    By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.\r\rAnd I began: \xc3\x92O apple, that mature\r    Alone hast been produced, O ancient father,\r    To whom each wife is daughter and daughter-in-law,\r\rDevoutly as I can I supplicate thee\r    That thou wouldst speak to me; thou seest my wish;\r    And I, to hear thee quickly, speak it not.\xc3\x93\r\rSometimes an animal, when covered, struggles\r    So that his impulse needs must be apparent,\r    By reason of the wrappage following it;\r\rAnd in like manner the primeval soul\r    Made clear to me athwart its covering\r    How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.\r\rThen breathed: \xc3\x92Without thy uttering it to me,\r    Thine inclination better I discern\r    Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee;\r\rFor I behold it in the truthful mirror,\r    That of Himself all things parhelion makes,\r    And none makes Him parhelion of itself.\r\rThou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me\r    Within the lofty garden, where this Lady\r    Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.\r\rAnd how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure,\r    And of the great disdain the proper cause,\r    And the language that I used and that I made.\r\rNow, son of mine, the tasting of the tree\r    Not in itself was cause of so great exile,\r    But solely the o\xc3\x95erstepping of the bounds.\r\rThere, whence thy Lady moved Virgilius,\r    Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits\r    Made by the sun, this Council I desired;\r\rAnd him I saw return to all the lights\r    Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty,\r    Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying.\r\rThe language that I spake was quite extinct\r    Before that in the work interminable\r    The people under Nimrod were employed;\r\rFor nevermore result of reasoning\r    (Because of human pleasure that doth change,\r    Obedient to the heavens) was durable.\r\rA natural action is it that man speaks;\r    But whether thus or thus, doth nature leave\r    To your own art, as seemeth best to you.\r\rEre I descended to the infernal anguish,\r    \xc3\x94El\xc3\x95 was on earth the name of the Chief Good,\r    From whom comes all the joy that wraps me round\r\r\xc3\x94Eli\xc3\x95 he then was called, and that is proper,\r    Because the use of men is like a leaf\r    On bough, which goeth and another cometh.\r\rUpon the mount that highest o\xc3\x95er the wave\r    Rises was I, in life or pure or sinful,\r    From the first hour to that which is the second,\r\rAs the sun changes quadrant, to the sixth.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXVII\r\r\r\xc3\x92Glory be to the Father, to the Son,\r    And Holy Ghost!\xc3\x93 all Paradise began,\r    So that the melody inebriate made me.\r\rWhat I beheld seemed unto me a smile\r    Of the universe; for my inebriation\r    Found entrance through the hearing and the sight.\r\rO joy! O gladness inexpressible!\r    O perfect life of love and peacefulness!\r    O riches without hankering secure!\r\rBefore mine eyes were standing the four torches\r    Enkindled, and the one that first had come\r    Began to make itself more luminous;\r\rAnd even such in semblance it became\r    As Jupiter would become, if he and Mars\r    Were birds, and they should interchange their feathers.\r\rThat Providence, which here distributeth\r    Season and service, in the blessed choir\r    Had silence upon every side imposed.\r\rWhen I heard say: \xc3\x92If I my colour change,\r    Marvel not at it; for while I am speaking\r    Thou shalt behold all these their colour change.\r\rHe who usurps upon the earth my place,\r    My place, my place, which vacant has become\r    Before the presence of the Son of God,\r\rHas of my cemetery made a sewer\r    Of blood and stench, whereby the Perverse One,\r    Who fell from here, below there is appeased!\xc3\x93\r\rWith the same colour which, through sun adverse,\r    Painteth the clouds at evening or at morn,\r    Beheld I then the whole of heaven suffused.\r\rAnd as a modest woman, who abides\r    Sure of herself, and at another\xc3\x95s failing,\r    From listening only, timorous becomes,\r\rEven thus did Beatrice change countenance;\r    And I believe in heaven was such eclipse,\r    When suffered the supreme Omnipotence;\r\rThereafterward proceeded forth his words\r    With voice so much transmuted from itself,\r    The very countenance was not more changed.\r\r\xc3\x92The spouse of Christ has never nurtured been\r    On blood of mine, of Linus and of Cletus,\r    To be made use of in acquest of gold;\r\rBut in acquest of this delightful life\r    Sixtus and Pius, Urban and Calixtus,\r    After much lamentation, shed their blood.\r\rOur purpose was not, that on the right hand\r    Of our successors should in part be seated\r    The Christian folk, in part upon the other;\r\rNor that the keys which were to me confided\r    Should e\xc3\x95er become the escutcheon on a banner,\r    That should wage war on those who are baptized;\r\rNor I be made the figure of a seal\r    To privileges venal and mendacious,\r    Whereat I often redden and flash with fire.\r\rIn garb of shepherds the rapacious wolves\r    Are seen from here above o\xc3\x95er all the pastures!\r    O wrath of God, why dost thou slumber still?\r\rTo drink our blood the Caorsines and Gascons\r    Are making ready. O thou good beginning,\r    Unto how vile an end must thou needs fall!\r\rBut the high Providence, that with Scipio\r    At Rome the glory of the world defended,\r    Will speedily bring aid, as I conceive;\r\rAnd thou, my son, who by thy mortal weight\r    Shalt down return again, open thy mouth;\r    What I conceal not, do not thou conceal.\xc3\x93\r\rAs with its frozen vapours downward falls\r    In flakes our atmosphere, what time the horn\r    Of the celestial Goat doth touch the sun,\r\rUpward in such array saw I the ether\r    Become, and flaked with the triumphant vapours,\r    Which there together with us had remained.\r\rMy sight was following up their semblances,\r    And followed till the medium, by excess,\r    The passing farther onward took from it;\r\rWhereat the Lady, who beheld me freed\r    From gazing upward, said to me: \xc3\x92Cast down\r    Thy sight, and see how far thou art turned round.\xc3\x93\r\rSince the first time that I had downward looked,\r    I saw that I had moved through the whole arc\r    Which the first climate makes from midst to end;\r\rSo that I saw the mad track of Ulysses\r    Past Gades, and this side, well nigh the shore\r    Whereon became Europa a sweet burden.\r\rAnd of this threshing-floor the site to me\r    Were more unveiled, but the sun was proceeding\r    Under my feet, a sign and more removed.\r\rMy mind enamoured, which is dallying\r    At all times with my Lady, to bring back\r    To her mine eyes was more than ever ardent.\r\rAnd if or Art or Nature has made bait\r    To catch the eyes and so possess the mind,\r    In human flesh or in its portraiture,\r\rAll joined together would appear as nought\r    To the divine delight which shone upon me\r    When to her smiling face I turned me round.\r\rThe virtue that her look endowed me with\r    From the fair nest of Leda tore me forth,\r    And up into the swiftest heaven impelled me.\r\rIts parts exceeding full of life and lofty\r    Are all so uniform, I cannot say\r    Which Beatrice selected for my place.\r\rBut she, who was aware of my desire,\r    Began, the while she smiled so joyously\r    That God seemed in her countenance to rejoice:\r\r\xc3\x92The nature of that motion, which keeps quiet\r    The centre and all the rest about it moves,\r    From hence begins as from its starting point.\r\rAnd in this heaven there is no other Where\r    Than in the Mind Divine, wherein is kindled\r    The love that turns it, and the power it rains.\r\rWithin a circle light and love embrace it,\r    Even as this doth the others, and that precinct\r    He who encircles it alone controls.\r\rIts motion is not by another meted,\r    But all the others measured are by this,\r    As ten is by the half and by the fifth.\r\rAnd in what manner time in such a pot\r    May have its roots, and in the rest its leaves,\r    Now unto thee can manifest be made.\r\rO Covetousness, that mortals dost ingulf\r    Beneath thee so, that no one hath the power\r    Of drawing back his eyes from out thy waves!\r\rFull fairly blossoms in mankind the will;\r    But the uninterrupted rain converts\r    Into abortive wildings the true plums.\r\rFidelity and innocence are found\r    Only in children; afterwards they both\r    Take flight or e\xc3\x95er the cheeks with down are covered.\r\rOne, while he prattles still, observes the fasts,\r    Who, when his tongue is loosed, forthwith devours\r    Whatever food under whatever moon;\r\rAnother, while he prattles, loves and listens\r    Unto his mother, who when speech is perfect\r    Forthwith desires to see her in her grave.\r\rEven thus is swarthy made the skin so white\r    In its first aspect of the daughter fair\r    Of him who brings the morn, and leaves the night.\r\rThou, that it may not be a marvel to thee,\r    Think that on earth there is no one who governs;\r    Whence goes astray the human family.\r\rEre January be unwintered wholly\r    By the centesimal on earth neglected,\r    Shall these supernal circles roar so loud\r\rThe tempest that has been so long awaited\r    Shall whirl the poops about where are the prows;\r    So that the fleet shall run its course direct,\r\rAnd the true fruit shall follow on the flower.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXVIII\r\r\rAfter the truth against the present life\r    Of miserable mortals was unfolded\r    By her who doth imparadise my mind,\r\rAs in a looking-glass a taper\xc3\x95s flame\r    He sees who from behind is lighted by it,\r    Before he has it in his sight or thought,\r\rAnd turns him round to see if so the glass\r    Tell him the truth, and sees that it accords\r    Therewith as doth a music with its metre,\r\rIn similar wise my memory recollecteth\r    That I did, looking into those fair eyes,\r    Of which Love made the springes to ensnare me.\r\rAnd as I turned me round, and mine were touched\r    By that which is apparent in that volume,\r    Whenever on its gyre we gaze intent,\r\rA point beheld I, that was raying out\r    Light so acute, the sight which it enkindles\r    Must close perforce before such great acuteness.\r\rAnd whatsoever star seems smallest here\r    Would seem to be a moon, if placed beside it.\r    As one star with another star is placed.\r\rPerhaps at such a distance as appears\r    A halo cincturing the light that paints it,\r    When densest is the vapour that sustains it,\r\rThus distant round the point a circle of fire\r    So swiftly whirled, that it would have surpassed\r    Whatever motion soonest girds the world;\r\rAnd this was by another circumcinct,\r    That by a third, the third then by a fourth,\r    By a fifth the fourth, and then by a sixth the fifth;\r\rThe seventh followed thereupon in width\r    So ample now, that Juno\xc3\x95s messenger\r    Entire would be too narrow to contain it.\r\rEven so the eighth and ninth; and every one\r    More slowly moved, according as it was\r    In number distant farther from the first.\r\rAnd that one had its flame most crystalline\r    From which less distant was the stainless spark,\r    I think because more with its truth imbued.\r\rMy Lady, who in my anxiety\r    Beheld me much perplexed, said: \xc3\x92From that point\r    Dependent is the heaven and nature all.\r\rBehold that circle most conjoined to it,\r    And know thou, that its motion is so swift\r    Through burning love whereby it is spurred on.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd I to her: \xc3\x92If the world were arranged\r    In the order which I see in yonder wheels,\r    What\xc3\x95s set before me would have satisfied me;\r\rBut in the world of sense we can perceive\r    That evermore the circles are diviner\r    As they are from the centre more remote\r\rWherefore if my desire is to be ended\r    In this miraculous and angelic temple,\r    That has for confines only love and light,\r\rTo hear behoves me still how the example\r    And the exemplar go not in one fashion,\r    Since for myself in vain I contemplate it.\xc3\x93\r\r\xc3\x92If thine own fingers unto such a knot\r    Be insufficient, it is no great wonder,\r    So hard hath it become for want of trying.\xc3\x93\r\rMy Lady thus; then said she: \xc3\x92Do thou take\r    What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated,\r    And exercise on that thy subtlety.\r\rThe circles corporal are wide and narrow\r    According to the more or less of virtue\r    Which is distributed through all their parts.\r\rThe greater goodness works the greater weal,\r    The greater weal the greater body holds,\r    If perfect equally are all its parts.\r\rTherefore this one which sweeps along with it\r    The universe sublime, doth correspond\r    Unto the circle which most loves and knows.\r\rOn which account, if thou unto the virtue\r    Apply thy measure, not to the appearance\r    Of substances that unto thee seem round,\r\rThou wilt behold a marvellous agreement,\r    Of more to greater, and of less to smaller,\r    In every heaven, with its Intelligence.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as remaineth splendid and serene\r    The hemisphere of air, when Boreas\r    Is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest,\r\rBecause is purified and resolved the rack\r    That erst disturbed it, till the welkin laughs\r    With all the beauties of its pageantry;\r\rThus did I likewise, after that my Lady\r    Had me provided with her clear response,\r    And like a star in heaven the truth was seen.\r\rAnd soon as to a stop her words had come,\r    Not otherwise does iron scintillate\r    When molten, than those circles scintillated.\r\rTheir coruscation all the sparks repeated,\r    And they so many were, their number makes\r    More millions than the doubling of the chess.\r\rI heard them sing hosanna choir by choir\r    To the fixed point which holds them at the \xc3\x94Ubi,\xc3\x95\r    And ever will, where they have ever been.\r\rAnd she, who saw the dubious meditations\r    Within my mind, \xc3\x92The primal circles,\xc3\x93 said,\r    \xc3\x92Have shown thee Seraphim and Cherubim.\r\rThus rapidly they follow their own bonds,\r    To be as like the point as most they can,\r    And can as far as they are high in vision.\r\rThose other Loves, that round about them go,\r    Thrones of the countenance divine are called,\r    Because they terminate the primal Triad.\r\rAnd thou shouldst know that they all have delight\r    As much as their own vision penetrates\r    The Truth, in which all intellect finds rest.\r\rFrom this it may be seen how blessedness\r    Is founded in the faculty which sees,\r    And not in that which loves, and follows next;\r\rAnd of this seeing merit is the measure,\r    Which is brought forth by grace, and by good will;\r    Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed.\r\rThe second Triad, which is germinating\r    In such wise in this sempiternal spring,\r    That no nocturnal Aries despoils,\r\rPerpetually hosanna warbles forth\r    With threefold melody, that sounds in three\r    Orders of joy, with which it is intrined.\r\rThe three Divine are in this hierarchy,\r    First the Dominions, and the Virtues next;\r    And the third order is that of the Powers.\r\rThen in the dances twain penultimate\r    The Principalities and Archangels wheel;\r    The last is wholly of angelic sports.\r\rThese orders upward all of them are gazing,\r    And downward so prevail, that unto God\r    They all attracted are and all attract.\r\rAnd Dionysius with so great desire\r    To contemplate these Orders set himself,\r    He named them and distinguished them as I do.\r\rBut Gregory afterwards dissented from him;\r    Wherefore, as soon as he unclosed his eyes\r    Within this heaven, he at himself did smile.\r\rAnd if so much of secret truth a mortal\r    Proffered on earth, I would not have thee marvel,\r    For he who saw it here revealed it to him,\r\rWith much more of the truth about these circles.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXIX\r\r\rAt what time both the children of Latona,\r    Surmounted by the Ram and by the Scales,\r    Together make a zone of the horizon,\r\rAs long as from the time the zenith holds them\r    In equipoise, till from that girdle both\r    Changing their hemisphere disturb the balance,\r\rSo long, her face depicted with a smile,\r    Did Beatrice keep silence while she gazed\r    Fixedly at the point which had o\xc3\x95ercome me.\r\rThen she began: \xc3\x92I say, and I ask not\r    What thou dost wish to hear, for I have seen it\r    Where centres every When and every \xc3\x94Ubi.\xc3\x95\r\rNot to acquire some good unto himself,\r    Which is impossible, but that his splendour\r    In its resplendency may say, \xc3\x94Subsisto,\xc3\x95\r\rIn his eternity outside of time,\r    Outside all other limits, as it pleased him,\r    Into new Loves the Eternal Love unfolded.\r\rNor as if torpid did he lie before;\r    For neither after nor before proceeded\r    The going forth of God upon these waters.\r\rMatter and Form unmingled and conjoined\r    Came into being that had no defect,\r    E\xc3\x95en as three arrows from a three-stringed bow.\r\rAnd as in glass, in amber, or in crystal\r    A sunbeam flashes so, that from its coming\r    To its full being is no interval,\r\rSo from its Lord did the triform effect\r    Ray forth into its being all together,\r    Without discrimination of beginning.\r\rOrder was con-created and constructed\r    In substances, and summit of the world\r    Were those wherein the pure act was produced.\r\rPure potentiality held the lowest part;\r    Midway bound potentiality with act\r    Such bond that it shall never be unbound.\r\rJerome has written unto you of angels\r    Created a long lapse of centuries\r    Or ever yet the other world was made;\r\rBut written is this truth in many places\r    By writers of the Holy Ghost, and thou\r    Shalt see it, if thou lookest well thereat.\r\rAnd even reason seeth it somewhat,\r    For it would not concede that for so long\r    Could be the motors without their perfection.\r\rNow dost thou know both where and when these Loves\r    Created were, and how; so that extinct\r    In thy desire already are three fires.\r\rNor could one reach, in counting, unto twenty\r    So swiftly, as a portion of these angels\r    Disturbed the subject of your elements.\r\rThe rest remained, and they began this art\r    Which thou discernest, with so great delight\r    That never from their circling do they cease.\r\rThe occasion of the fall was the accursed\r    Presumption of that One, whom thou hast seen\r    By all the burden of the world constrained.\r\rThose whom thou here beholdest modest were\r    To recognise themselves as of that goodness\r    Which made them apt for so much understanding;\r\rOn which account their vision was exalted\r    By the enlightening grace and their own merit,\r    So that they have a full and steadfast will.\r\rI would not have thee doubt, but certain be,\r    \xc3\x95Tis meritorious to receive this grace,\r    According as the affection opens to it.\r\rNow round about in this consistory\r    Much mayst thou contemplate, if these my words\r    Be gathered up, without all further aid.\r\rBut since upon the earth, throughout your schools,\r    They teach that such is the angelic nature\r    That it doth hear, and recollect, and will,\r\rMore will I say, that thou mayst see unmixed\r    The truth that is confounded there below,\r    Equivocating in such like prelections.\r\rThese substances, since in God\xc3\x95s countenance\r    They jocund were, turned not away their sight\r    From that wherefrom not anything is hidden;\r\rHence they have not their vision intercepted\r    By object new, and hence they do not need\r    To recollect, through interrupted thought.\r\rSo that below, not sleeping, people dream,\r    Believing they speak truth, and not believing;\r    And in the last is greater sin and shame.\r\rBelow you do not journey by one path\r    Philosophising; so transporteth you\r    Love of appearance and the thought thereof.\r\rAnd even this above here is endured\r    With less disdain, than when is set aside\r    The Holy Writ, or when it is distorted.\r\rThey think not there how much of blood it costs\r    To sow it in the world, and how he pleases\r    Who in humility keeps close to it.\r\rEach striveth for appearance, and doth make\r    His own inventions; and these treated are\r    By preachers, and the Evangel holds its peace.\r\rOne sayeth that the moon did backward turn,\r    In the Passion of Christ, and interpose herself\r    So that the sunlight reached not down below;\r\rAnd lies; for of its own accord the light\r    Hid itself; whence to Spaniards and to Indians,\r    As to the Jews, did such eclipse respond.\r\rFlorence has not so many Lapi and Bindi\r    As fables such as these, that every year\r    Are shouted from the pulpit back and forth,\r\rIn such wise that the lambs, who do not know,\r    Come back from pasture fed upon the wind,\r    And not to see the harm doth not excuse them.\r\rChrist did not to his first disciples say,\r    \xc3\x94Go forth, and to the world preach idle tales,\xc3\x95\r    But unto them a true foundation gave;\r\rAnd this so loudly sounded from their lips,\r    That, in the warfare to enkindle Faith,\r    They made of the Evangel shields and lances.\r\rNow men go forth with jests and drolleries\r    To preach, and if but well the people laugh,\r    The hood puffs out, and nothing more is asked.\r\rBut in the cowl there nestles such a bird,\r    That, if the common people were to see it,\r    They would perceive what pardons they confide in,\r\rFor which so great on earth has grown the folly,\r    That, without proof of any testimony,\r    To each indulgence they would flock together.\r\rBy this Saint Anthony his pig doth fatten,\r    And many others, who are worse than pigs,\r    Paying in money without mark of coinage.\r\rBut since we have digressed abundantly,\r    Turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path,\r    So that the way be shortened with the time.\r\rThis nature doth so multiply itself\r    In numbers, that there never yet was speech\r    Nor mortal fancy that can go so far.\r\rAnd if thou notest that which is revealed\r    By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands\r    Number determinate is kept concealed.\r\rThe primal light, that all irradiates it,\r    By modes as many is received therein,\r    As are the splendours wherewith it is mated.\r\rHence, inasmuch as on the act conceptive\r    The affection followeth, of love the sweetness\r    Therein diversely fervid is or tepid.\r\rThe height behold now and the amplitude\r    Of the eternal power, since it hath made\r    Itself so many mirrors, where \xc3\x95tis broken,\r\rOne in itself remaining as before.\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXX\r\r\rPerchance six thousand miles remote from us\r    Is glowing the sixth hour, and now this world\r    Inclines its shadow almost to a level,\r\rWhen the mid-heaven begins to make itself\r    So deep to us, that here and there a star\r    Ceases to shine so far down as this depth,\r\rAnd as advances bright exceedingly\r    The handmaid of the sun, the heaven is closed\r    Light after light to the most beautiful;\r\rNot otherwise the Triumph, which for ever\r    Plays round about the point that vanquished me,\r    Seeming enclosed by what itself encloses,\r\rLittle by little from my vision faded;\r    Whereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice\r    My seeing nothing and my love constrained me.\r\rIf what has hitherto been said of her\r    Were all concluded in a single praise,\r    Scant would it be to serve the present turn.\r\rNot only does the beauty I beheld\r    Transcend ourselves, but truly I believe\r    Its Maker only may enjoy it all.\r\rVanquished do I confess me by this passage\r    More than by problem of his theme was ever\r    O\xc3\x95ercome the comic or the tragic poet;\r\rFor as the sun the sight that trembles most,\r    Even so the memory of that sweet smile\r    My mind depriveth of its very self.\r\rFrom the first day that I beheld her face\r    In this life, to the moment of this look,\r    The sequence of my song has ne\xc3\x95er been severed;\r\rBut now perforce this sequence must desist\r    From following her beauty with my verse,\r    As every artist at his uttermost.\r\rSuch as I leave her to a greater fame\r    Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing\r    Its arduous matter to a final close,\r\rWith voice and gesture of a perfect leader\r    She recommenced: \xc3\x92We from the greatest body\r    Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;\r\rLight intellectual replete with love,\r    Love of true good replete with ecstasy,\r    Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness.\r\rHere shalt thou see the one host and the other\r    Of Paradise, and one in the same aspects\r    Which at the final judgment thou shalt see.\xc3\x93\r\rEven as a sudden lightning that disperses\r    The visual spirits, so that it deprives\r    The eye of impress from the strongest objects,\r\rThus round about me flashed a living light,\r    And left me swathed around with such a veil\r    Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw.\r\r\xc3\x92Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven\r    Welcomes into itself with such salute,\r    To make the candle ready for its flame.\xc3\x93\r\rNo sooner had within me these brief words\r    An entrance found, than I perceived myself\r    To be uplifted over my own power,\r\rAnd I with vision new rekindled me,\r    Such that no light whatever is so pure\r    But that mine eyes were fortified against it.\r\rAnd light I saw in fashion of a river\r    Fulvid with its effulgence, \xc3\x95twixt two banks\r    Depicted with an admirable Spring.\r\rOut of this river issued living sparks,\r    And on all sides sank down into the flowers,\r    Like unto rubies that are set in gold;\r\rAnd then, as if inebriate with the odours,\r    They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,\r    And as one entered issued forth another.\r\r\xc3\x92The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee\r    To have intelligence of what thou seest,\r    Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells.\r\rBut of this water it behoves thee drink\r    Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked.\xc3\x93\r    Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;\r\rAnd added: \xc3\x92The river and the topazes\r    Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,\r    Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;\r\rNot that these things are difficult in themselves,\r    But the deficiency is on thy side,\r    For yet thou hast not vision so exalted.\xc3\x93\r\rThere is no babe that leaps so suddenly\r    With face towards the milk, if he awake\r    Much later than his usual custom is,\r\rAs I did, that I might make better mirrors\r    Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave\r    Which flows that we therein be better made.\r\rAnd even as the penthouse of mine eyelids\r    Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me\r    Out of its length to be transformed to round.\r\rThen as a folk who have been under masks\r    Seem other than before, if they divest\r    The semblance not their own they disappeared in,\r\rThus into greater pomp were changed for me\r    The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw\r    Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.\r\rO splendour of God! by means of which I saw\r    The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,\r    Give me the power to say how it I saw!\r\rThere is a light above, which visible\r    Makes the Creator unto every creature,\r    Who only in beholding Him has peace,\r\rAnd it expands itself in circular form\r    To such extent, that its circumference\r    Would be too large a girdle for the sun.\r\rThe semblance of it is all made of rays\r    Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,\r    Which takes therefrom vitality and power.\r\rAnd as a hill in water at its base\r    Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty\r    When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,\r\rSo, ranged aloft all round about the light,\r    Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand\r    All who above there have from us returned.\r\rAnd if the lowest row collect within it\r    So great a light, how vast the amplitude\r    Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves!\r\rMy vision in the vastness and the height\r    Lost not itself, but comprehended all\r    The quantity and quality of that gladness.\r\rThere near and far nor add nor take away;\r    For there where God immediately doth govern,\r    The natural law in naught is relevant.\r\rInto the yellow of the Rose Eternal\r    That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odour\r    Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun,\r\rAs one who silent is and fain would speak,\r    Me Beatrice drew on, and said: \xc3\x92Behold\r    Of the white stoles how vast the convent is!\r\rBehold how vast the circuit of our city!\r    Behold our seats so filled to overflowing,\r    That here henceforward are few people wanting!\r\rOn that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed\r    For the crown\xc3\x95s sake already placed upon it,\r    Before thou suppest at this wedding feast\r\rShall sit the soul (that is to be Augustus\r    On earth) of noble Henry, who shall come\r    To redress Italy ere she be ready.\r\rBlind covetousness, that casts its spell upon you,\r    Has made you like unto the little child,\r    Who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse.\r\rAnd in the sacred forum then shall be\r    A Prefect such, that openly or covert\r    On the same road he will not walk with him.\r\rBut long of God he will not be endured\r    In holy office; he shall be thrust down\r    Where Simon Magus is for his deserts,\r\rAnd make him of Alagna lower go!\xc3\x93\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXXI\r\r\rIn fashion then as of a snow-white rose\r    Displayed itself to me the saintly host,\r    Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride,\r\rBut the other host, that flying sees and sings\r    The glory of Him who doth enamour it,\r    And the goodness that created it so noble,\r\rEven as a swarm of bees, that sinks in flowers\r    One moment, and the next returns again\r    To where its labour is to sweetness turned,\r\rSank into the great flower, that is adorned\r    With leaves so many, and thence reascended\r    To where its love abideth evermore.\r\rTheir faces had they all of living flame,\r    And wings of gold, and all the rest so white\r    No snow unto that limit doth attain.\r\rFrom bench to bench, into the flower descending,\r    They carried something of the peace and ardour\r    Which by the fanning of their flanks they won.\r\rNor did the interposing \xc3\x95twixt the flower\r    And what was o\xc3\x95er it of such plenitude\r    Of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour;\r\rBecause the light divine so penetrates\r    The universe, according to its merit,\r    That naught can be an obstacle against it.\r\rThis realm secure and full of gladsomeness,\r    Crowded with ancient people and with modern,\r    Unto one mark had all its look and love.\r\rO Trinal Light, that in a single star\r    Sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them,\r    Look down upon our tempest here below!\r\rIf the barbarians, coming from some region\r    That every day by Helice is covered,\r    Revolving with her son whom she delights in,\r\rBeholding Rome and all her noble works,\r    Were wonder-struck, what time the Lateran\r    Above all mortal things was eminent,\xc3\x91\r\rI who to the divine had from the human,\r    From time unto eternity, had come,\r    From Florence to a people just and sane,\r\rWith what amazement must I have been filled!\r    Truly between this and the joy, it was\r    My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute.\r\rAnd as a pilgrim who delighteth him\r    In gazing round the temple of his vow,\r    And hopes some day to retell how it was,\r\rSo through the living light my way pursuing\r    Directed I mine eyes o\xc3\x95er all the ranks,\r    Now up, now down, and now all round about.\r\rFaces I saw of charity persuasive,\r    Embellished by His light and their own smile,\r    And attitudes adorned with every grace.\r\rThe general form of Paradise already\r    My glance had comprehended as a whole,\r    In no part hitherto remaining fixed,\r\rAnd round I turned me with rekindled wish\r    My Lady to interrogate of things\r    Concerning which my mind was in suspense.\r\rOne thing I meant, another answered me;\r    I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw\r    An Old Man habited like the glorious people.\r\rO\xc3\x95erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks\r    With joy benign, in attitude of pity\r    As to a tender father is becoming.\r\rAnd \xc3\x92She, where is she?\xc3\x93 instantly I said;\r    Whence he: \xc3\x92To put an end to thy desire,\r    Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place.\r\rAnd if thou lookest up to the third round\r    Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her\r    Upon the throne her merits have assigned her.\xc3\x93\r\rWithout reply I lifted up mine eyes,\r    And saw her, as she made herself a crown\r    Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.\r\rNot from that region which the highest thunders\r    Is any mortal eye so far removed,\r    In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,\r\rAs there from Beatrice my sight; but this\r    Was nothing unto me; because her image\r    Descended not to me by medium blurred.\r\r\xc3\x92O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,\r    And who for my salvation didst endure\r    In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,\r\rOf whatsoever things I have beheld,\r    As coming from thy power and from thy goodness\r    I recognise the virtue and the grace.\r\rThou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,\r    By all those ways, by all the expedients,\r    Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.\r\rPreserve towards me thy magnificence,\r    So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,\r    Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body.\xc3\x93\r\rThus I implored; and she, so far away,\r    Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;\r    Then unto the eternal fountain turned.\r\rAnd said the Old Man holy: \xc3\x92That thou mayst\r    Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,\r    Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,\r\rFly with thine eyes all round about this garden;\r    For seeing it will discipline thy sight\r    Farther to mount along the ray divine.\r\rAnd she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn\r    Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,\r    Because that I her faithful Bernard am.\xc3\x93\r\rAs he who peradventure from Croatia\r    Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,\r    Who through its ancient fame is never sated,\r\rBut says in thought, the while it is displayed,\r    \xc3\x92My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,\r    Now was your semblance made like unto this?\xc3\x93\r\rEven such was I while gazing at the living\r    Charity of the man, who in this world\r    By contemplation tasted of that peace.\r\r\xc3\x92Thou son of grace, this jocund life,\xc3\x93 began he,\r    \xc3\x92Will not be known to thee by keeping ever\r    Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;\r\rBut mark the circles to the most remote,\r    Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen\r    To whom this realm is subject and devoted.\xc3\x93\r\rI lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn\r    The oriental part of the horizon\r    Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,\r\rThus, as if going with mine eyes from vale\r    To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness\r    Surpass in splendour all the other front.\r\rAnd even as there where we await the pole\r    That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more\r    The light, and is on either side diminished,\r\rSo likewise that pacific oriflamme\r    Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side\r    In equal measure did the flame abate.\r\rAnd at that centre, with their wings expanded,\r    More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,\r    Each differing in effulgence and in kind.\r\rI saw there at their sports and at their songs\r    A beauty smiling, which the gladness was\r    Within the eyes of all the other saints;\r\rAnd if I had in speaking as much wealth\r    As in imagining, I should not dare\r    To attempt the smallest part of its delight.\r\rBernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes\r    Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour,\r    His own with such affection turned to her\r\rThat it made mine more ardent to behold.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXXII\r\r\rAbsorbed in his delight, that contemplator\r    Assumed the willing office of a teacher,\r    And gave beginning to these holy words:\r\r\xc3\x92The wound that Mary closed up and anointed,\r    She at her feet who is so beautiful,\r    She is the one who opened it and pierced it.\r\rWithin that order which the third seats make\r    Is seated Rachel, lower than the other,\r    With Beatrice, in manner as thou seest.\r\rSarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was\r    Ancestress of the Singer, who for dole\r    Of the misdeed said, \xc3\x94Miserere mei,\xc3\x95\r\rCanst thou behold from seat to seat descending\r    Down in gradation, as with each one\xc3\x95s name\r    I through the Rose go down from leaf to leaf.\r\rAnd downward from the seventh row, even as\r    Above the same, succeed the Hebrew women,\r    Dividing all the tresses of the flower;\r\rBecause, according to the view which Faith\r    In Christ had taken, these are the partition\r    By which the sacred stairways are divided.\r\rUpon this side, where perfect is the flower\r    With each one of its petals, seated are\r    Those who believed in Christ who was to come.\r\rUpon the other side, where intersected\r    With vacant spaces are the semicircles,\r    Are those who looked to Christ already come.\r\rAnd as, upon this side, the glorious seat\r    Of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats\r    Below it, such a great division make,\r\rSo opposite doth that of the great John,\r    Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom\r    Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell.\r\rAnd under him thus to divide were chosen\r    Francis, and Benedict, and Augustine,\r    And down to us the rest from round to round.\r\rBehold now the high providence divine;\r    For one and other aspect of the Faith\r    In equal measure shall this garden fill.\r\rAnd know that downward from that rank which cleaves\r    Midway the sequence of the two divisions,\r    Not by their proper merit are they seated;\r\rBut by another\xc3\x95s under fixed conditions;\r    For these are spirits one and all assoiled\r    Before they any true election had.\r\rWell canst thou recognise it in their faces,\r    And also in their voices puerile,\r    If thou regard them well and hearken to them.\r\rNow doubtest thou, and doubting thou art silent;\r    But I will loosen for thee the strong bond\r    In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast.\r\rWithin the amplitude of this domain\r    No casual point can possibly find place,\r    No more than sadness can, or thirst, or hunger;\r\rFor by eternal law has been established\r    Whatever thou beholdest, so that closely\r    The ring is fitted to the finger here.\r\rAnd therefore are these people, festinate\r    Unto true life, not \xc3\x94sine causa\xc3\x95 here\r    More and less excellent among themselves.\r\rThe King, by means of whom this realm reposes\r    In so great love and in so great delight\r    That no will ventureth to ask for more,\r\rIn his own joyous aspect every mind\r    Creating, at his pleasure dowers with grace\r    Diversely; and let here the effect suffice.\r\rAnd this is clearly and expressly noted\r    For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins\r    Who in their mother had their anger roused.\r\rAccording to the colour of the hair,\r    Therefore, with such a grace the light supreme\r    Consenteth that they worthily be crowned.\r\rWithout, then, any merit of their deeds,\r    Stationed are they in different gradations,\r    Differing only in their first acuteness.\r\r\xc3\x95Tis true that in the early centuries,\r    With innocence, to work out their salvation\r    Sufficient was the faith of parents only.\r\rAfter the earlier ages were completed,\r    Behoved it that the males by circumcision\r    Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;\r\rBut after that the time of grace had come\r    Without the baptism absolute of Christ,\r    Such innocence below there was retained.\r\rLook now into the face that unto Christ\r    Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only\r    Is able to prepare thee to see Christ.\xc3\x93\r\rOn her did I behold so great a gladness\r    Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds\r    Created through that altitude to fly,\r\rThat whatsoever I had seen before\r    Did not suspend me in such admiration,\r    Nor show me such similitude of God.\r\rAnd the same Love that first descended there,\r    \xc3\x92Ave Maria, gratia plena,\xc3\x93 singing,\r    In front of her his wings expanded wide.\r\rUnto the canticle divine responded\r    From every part the court beatified,\r    So that each sight became serener for it.\r\r\xc3\x92O holy father, who for me endurest\r    To be below here, leaving the sweet place\r    In which thou sittest by eternal lot,\r\rWho is the Angel that with so much joy\r    Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,\r    Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?\xc3\x93\r\rThus I again recourse had to the teaching\r    Of that one who delighted him in Mary\r    As doth the star of morning in the sun.\r\rAnd he to me: \xc3\x92Such gallantry and grace\r    As there can be in Angel and in soul,\r    All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;\r\rBecause he is the one who bore the palm\r    Down unto Mary, when the Son of God\r    To take our burden on himself decreed.\r\rBut now come onward with thine eyes, as I\r    Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians\r    Of this most just and merciful of empires.\r\rThose two that sit above there most enrapture\r    As being very near unto Augusta,\r    Are as it were the two roots of this Rose.\r\rHe who upon the left is near her placed\r    The father is, by whose audacious taste\r    The human species so much bitter tastes.\r\rUpon the right thou seest that ancient father\r    Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ\r    The keys committed of this lovely flower.\r\rAnd he who all the evil days beheld,\r    Before his death, of her the beauteous bride\r    Who with the spear and with the nails was won,\r\rBeside him sits, and by the other rests\r    That leader under whom on manna lived\r    The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.\r\rOpposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,\r    So well content to look upon her daughter,\r    Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.\r\rAnd opposite the eldest household father\r    Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved\r    When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.\r\rBut since the moments of thy vision fly,\r    Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor\r    Who makes the gown according to his cloth,\r\rAnd unto the first Love will turn our eyes,\r    That looking upon Him thou penetrate\r    As far as possible through his effulgence.\r\rTruly, lest peradventure thou recede,\r    Moving thy wings believing to advance,\r    By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;\r\rGrace from that one who has the power to aid thee;\r    And thou shalt follow me with thy affection\r    That from my words thy heart turn not aside.\xc3\x93\r\rAnd he began this holy orison.\r\r\r\r\rParadiso: Canto XXXIII\r\r\r\xc3\x92Thou Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son,\r    Humble and high beyond all other creature,\r    The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,\r\rThou art the one who such nobility\r    To human nature gave, that its Creator\r    Did not disdain to make himself its creature.\r\rWithin thy womb rekindled was the love,\r    By heat of which in the eternal peace\r    After such wise this flower has germinated.\r\rHere unto us thou art a noonday torch\r    Of charity, and below there among mortals\r    Thou art the living fountain-head of hope.\r\rLady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,\r    That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,\r    His aspirations without wings would fly.\r\rNot only thy benignity gives succour\r    To him who asketh it, but oftentimes\r    Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.\r\rIn thee compassion is, in thee is pity,\r    In thee magnificence; in thee unites\r    Whate\xc3\x95er of goodness is in any creature.\r\rNow doth this man, who from the lowest depth\r    Of the universe as far as here has seen\r    One after one the spiritual lives,\r\rSupplicate thee through grace for so much power\r    That with his eyes he may uplift himself\r    Higher towards the uttermost salvation.\r\rAnd I, who never burned for my own seeing\r    More than I do for his, all of my prayers\r    Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,\r\rThat thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud\r    Of his mortality so with thy prayers,\r    That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.\r\rStill farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst\r    Whate\xc3\x95er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve\r    After so great a vision his affections.\r\rLet thy protection conquer human movements;\r    See Beatrice and all the blessed ones\r    My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!\xc3\x93\r\rThe eyes beloved and revered of God,\r    Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us\r    How grateful unto her are prayers devout;\r\rThen unto the Eternal Light they turned,\r    On which it is not credible could be\r    By any creature bent an eye so clear.\r\rAnd I, who to the end of all desires\r    Was now approaching, even as I ought\r    The ardour of desire within me ended.\r\rBernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,\r    That I should upward look; but I already\r    Was of my own accord such as he wished;\r\rBecause my sight, becoming purified,\r    Was entering more and more into the ray\r    Of the High Light which of itself is true.\r\rFrom that time forward what I saw was greater\r    Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,\r    And yields the memory unto such excess.\r\rEven as he is who seeth in a dream,\r    And after dreaming the imprinted passion\r    Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,\r\rEven such am I, for almost utterly\r    Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet\r    Within my heart the sweetness born of it;\r\rEven thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,\r    Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves\r    Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.\r\rO Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee\r    From the conceits of mortals, to my mind\r    Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,\r\rAnd make my tongue of so great puissance,\r    That but a single sparkle of thy glory\r    It may bequeath unto the future people;\r\rFor by returning to my memory somewhat,\r    And by a little sounding in these verses,\r    More of thy victory shall be conceived!\r\rI think the keenness of the living ray\r    Which I endured would have bewildered me,\r    If but mine eyes had been averted from it;\r\rAnd I remember that I was more bold\r    On this account to bear, so that I joined\r    My aspect with the Glory Infinite.\r\rO grace abundant, by which I presumed\r    To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,\r    So that the seeing I consumed therein!\r\rI saw that in its depth far down is lying\r    Bound up with love together in one volume,\r    What through the universe in leaves is scattered;\r\rSubstance, and accident, and their operations,\r    All interfused together in such wise\r    That what I speak of is one simple light.\r\rThe universal fashion of this knot\r    Methinks I saw, since more abundantly\r    In saying this I feel that I rejoice.\r\rOne moment is more lethargy to me,\r    Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise\r    That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!\r\rMy mind in this wise wholly in suspense,\r    Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,\r    And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.\r\rIn presence of that light one such becomes,\r    That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect\r    It is impossible he e\xc3\x95er consent;\r\rBecause the good, which object is of will,\r    Is gathered all in this, and out of it\r    That is defective which is perfect there.\r\rShorter henceforward will my language fall\r    Of what I yet remember, than an infant\xc3\x95s\r    Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.\r\rNot because more than one unmingled semblance\r    Was in the living light on which I looked,\r    For it is always what it was before;\r\rBut through the sight, that fortified itself\r    In me by looking, one appearance only\r    To me was ever changing as I changed.\r\rWithin the deep and luminous subsistence\r    Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,\r    Of threefold colour and of one dimension,\r\rAnd by the second seemed the first reflected\r    As Iris is by Iris, and the third\r    Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.\r\rO how all speech is feeble and falls short\r    Of my conceit, and this to what I saw\r    Is such, \xc3\x95tis not enough to call it little!\r\rO Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,\r    Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself\r    And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!\r\rThat circulation, which being thus conceived\r    Appeared in thee as a reflected light,\r    When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,\r\rWithin itself, of its own very colour\r    Seemed to me painted with our effigy,\r    Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.\r\rAs the geometrician, who endeavours\r    To square the circle, and discovers not,\r    By taking thought, the principle he wants,\r\rEven such was I at that new apparition;\r    I wished to see how the image to the circle\r    Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;\r\rBut my own wings were not enough for this,\r    Had it not been that then my mind there smote\r    A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.\r\rHere vigour failed the lofty fantasy:\r    But now was turning my desire and will,\r    Even as a wheel that equally is moved,\r\rThe Love which moves the sun and the other stars.\r\r\r\r\rAPPENDIX\r\rSIX SONNETS ON DANTE\xc3\x95S DIVINE COMEDY BY HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW\r(1807-1882)\r\r\rI\r\rOft have I seen at some cathedral door\r    A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat,\r    Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet\r    Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor\rKneel to repeat his paternoster o\xc3\x95er;\r    Far off the noises of the world retreat;\r    The loud vociferations of the street\r    Become an undistinguishable roar.\rSo, as I enter here from day to day,\r    And leave my burden at this minster gate,\r    Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,\rThe tumult of the time disconsolate\r    To inarticulate murmurs dies away,\r    While the eternal ages watch and wait.\r\r\rII\r\rHow strange the sculptures that adorn these towers!\r    This crowd of statues, in whose folded sleeves\r    Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves\r    Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers,\rAnd the vast minster seems a cross of flowers!\r    But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves\r    Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves,\r    And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers!\rAh! from what agonies of heart and brain,\r    What exultations trampling on despair,\r    What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,\rWhat passionate outcry of a soul in pain,\r    Uprose this poem of the earth and air,\r    This mediaeval miracle of song!\r\r\rIII\r\rI enter, and I see thee in the gloom\r    Of the long aisles, O poet saturnine!\r    And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine.\r    The air is filled with some unknown perfume;\rThe congregation of the dead make room\r    For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine;\r    Like rooks that haunt Ravenna\xc3\x95s groves of pine,\r    The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb.\rFrom the confessionals I hear arise\r    Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies,\r    And lamentations from the crypts below\rAnd then a voice celestial that begins\r    With the pathetic words, \xc3\x92Although your sins\r    As scarlet be,\xc3\x93 and ends with \xc3\x92as the snow.\xc3\x93\r\r\rIV\r\rWith snow-white veil, and garments as of flame,\r    She stands before thee, who so long ago\r    Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe\r    From which thy song in all its splendors came;\rAnd while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name,\r    The ice about thy heart melts as the snow\r    On mountain heights, and in swift overflow\r    Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame.\rThou makest full confession; and a gleam\r    As of the dawn on some dark forest cast,\r    Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase;\rLethe and Eunoe\xc3\x91the remembered dream\r    And the forgotten sorrow\xc3\x91bring at last\r    That perfect pardon which is perfect peace.\r\r\rV\r\rI Lift mine eyes, and all the windows blaze\r    With forms of saints and holy men who died,\r    Here martyred and hereafter glorified;\r    And the great Rose upon its leaves displays\rChrist\xc3\x95s Triumph, and the angelic roundelays,\r    With splendor upon splendor multiplied;\r    And Beatrice again at Dante\xc3\x95s side\r    No more rebukes, but smiles her words of praise.\rAnd then the organ sounds, and unseen choirs\r    Sing the old Latin hymns of peace and love\r    And benedictions of the Holy Ghost;\rAnd the melodious bells among the spires\r    O\xc3\x95er all the house-tops and through heaven above\r    Proclaim the elevation of the Host!\r\r\rVI\r\rO star of morning and of liberty!\r    O bringer of the light, whose splendor shines\r    Above the darkness of the Apennines,\r    Forerunner of the day that is to be!\rThe voices of the city and the sea,\r    The voices of the mountains and the pines,\r    Repeat thy song, till the familiar lines\r    Are footpaths for the thought of Italy!\rThy fame is blown abroad from all the heights,\r    Through all the nations; and a sound is heard,\r    As of a mighty wind, and men devout,\rStrangers of Rome, and the new proselytes,\r    In their own language hear thy wondrous word,\r    And many are amazed and many doubt.\r\r\r\r\r*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DIVINE COMEDY ***\r\r***** This file should be named 1004-0.txt or 1004-0.zip

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\rLiterary Archive Foundation\r\rProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\rwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\rincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\rfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\rarray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\rstatus with the IRS.\r\rThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\rcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\rStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\rconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\rwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\rwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\rDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\rstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\rWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\rhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\ragainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\rapproach us with offers to donate.\r\rInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\rany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\routside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\rPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\rmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\rways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\rdonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\rSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\rProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\rGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\rfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\rdistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\rvolunteer support.\r\rProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\reditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\rthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\rnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\redition.\r\rMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\rfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\rThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\rincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\rArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\rsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\r\r\r\n'
