The Burial of the Dead\r\r\xc3\x8a April is the cruellest month, breeding\rLilacs out of the dead land, mixing\rMemory and desire, stirring\rDull roots with spring rain.\rWinter kept us warm, covering\rEarth in forgetful snow, feeding\rA little life with dried tubers.\rSummer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee\rWith a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,\rAnd went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,\rAnd drank coffee, and talked for an hour.\rBin gar keine Russin, stamm\xc3\x95 aus Litauen, echt deutsch.\rAnd when we were children, staying at the arch-duke\xc3\x95s,\rMy cousin\xc3\x95s, he took me out on a sled,\rAnd I was frightened. He said, Marie,\rMarie, hold on tight. And down we went.\rIn the mountains, there you feel free.\rI read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.\r\r\xc3\x8a What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow\rOut of this stony rubbish? Son of man,\rYou cannot say, or guess, for you know only\rA heap of broken images, where the sun beats,\rAnd the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,\rAnd the dry stone no sound of water. Only\rThere is shadow under this red rock,\r(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),\rAnd I will show you something different from either\rYour shadow at morning striding behind you\rOr your shadow at evening rising to meet you;\rI will show you fear in a handful of dust.\r\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a Frisch weht der Wind\r\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8aDer Heimat zu\r\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8aMein Irisch Kind,\r\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8a\xc3\x8aWo weilest du?\r\xc3\x92You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;\r\xc3\x92They called me the hyacinth girl.\xc3\x93\r\xc3\x91Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,\rYour arms full, and your hair wet, I could not\rSpeak, and my eyes failed, I was neither\rLiving nor dead, and I knew nothing,\rLooking into the heart of light, the silence.\rOed\xc3\x95 und leer das Meer.\r\r\xc3\x8a Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,\rHad a bad cold, nevertheless\rIs known to be the wisest woman in Europe,\rWith a wicked pack of cards.

The Fire Sermon\r\r\xc3\x8a The river\xc3\x95s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf\rClutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind\rCrosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.\rSweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\rThe river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,\rSilk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends\rOr other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.\rAnd their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;\rDeparted, have left no addresses.\rBy the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .\rSweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,\rSweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.\rBut at my back in a cold blast I hear\rThe rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.\r\rA rat crept softly through the vegetation\rDragging its slimy belly on the bank\rWhile I was fishing in the dull canal\rOn a winter evening round behind the gashouse\rMusing upon the king my brother\xc3\x95s wreck\rAnd on the king my father\xc3\x95s death before him.\rWhite bodies naked on the low damp ground\rAnd bones cast in a little low dry garret,\rRattled by the rat\xc3\x95s foot only, year to year.\rBut at my back from time to time I hear\rThe sound of horns and motors, which shall bring\rSweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.\rO the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter\rAnd on her daughter\rThey wash their feet in soda water\rEt O ces voix d\xc3\x95enfants, chantant dans la coupole!\r\rTwit twit twit\rJug jug jug jug jug jug\rSo rudely forc\xc3\x95d.\rTereu\r\rUnreal City\rUnder the brown fog of a winter noon\rMr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant\rUnshaven, with a pocket full of currants\rC.i.f. London: documents at sight,\rAsked me in demotic French\rTo luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel\rFollowed by a weekend at the Metropole.\r\rAt the violet hour, when the eyes and back\rTurn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits\rLike a taxi throbbing waiting,\rI Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,\rOld man with wrinkled female breasts, can see\rAt the violet hour, the evening hour that strives\rHomeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,\rThe typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights\rHer stove, and lays out food in tins.\rOut of the window perilously spread\rHer drying combinations touched by the sun\xc3\x95s last rays,\rOn the divan are piled (at night her bed)\rStockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.\rI Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs\rPerceived the scene, and foretold the rest\xc3\x91\rI too awaited the expected guest.\rHe, the young man carbuncular, arrives,\rA small house agent\xc3\x95s clerk, with one bold stare,\rOne of the low on whom assurance sits\rAs a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.\rThe time is now propitious, as he guesses,\rThe meal is ended, she is bored and tired,\rEndeavours to engage her in caresses\rWhich still are unreproved, if undesired.\rFlushed and decided, he assaults at once;\rExploring hands encounter no defence;\rHis vanity requires no response,\rAnd makes a welcome of indifference.\r(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all\rEnacted on this same divan or bed;\rI who have sat by Thebes below the wall\rAnd walked among the lowest of the dead.)\rBestows one final patronising kiss,\rAnd gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .\r\rShe turns and looks a moment in the glass,\rHardly aware of her departed lover;\rHer brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:\r\xc3\x92Well now that\xc3\x95s done: and I\xc3\x95m glad it\xc3\x95s over.\xc3\x93\rWhen lovely woman stoops to folly and\rPaces about her room again, alone,\rShe smoothes her hair with automatic hand,\rAnd puts a record on the gramophone.\r\r\xc3\x92This music crept by me upon the waters\xc3\x93\rAnd along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.\rO City city, I can sometimes hear\rBeside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,\rThe pleasant whining of a mandoline\rAnd a clatter and a chatter from within\rWhere fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls\rOf Magnus Martyr
