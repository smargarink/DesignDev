Many a brave soul did it send hurrying\rdown to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures,\rfor so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the\rson of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with\rone another. \r\rAnd which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the\rson of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence\rupon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had\rdishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships\rof the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great\rransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed\rwith a suppliant\'s wreath and he besought the Achaeans, but most of\rall the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs. \r\r"Sons of Atreus," he cried, "and all other Achaeans, may the gods\rwho dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach\ryour homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for\rher, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove." \r\rOn this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting\rthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,\rwho spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. "Old man," said\rhe, "let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming\rhereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you\rnothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos\rfar from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting\rmy couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for\ryou." \r\rThe old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by\rthe shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom\rlovely Leto had borne. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of the silver bow,\rthat protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy\rmight, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple\rwith garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats,\rgrant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the\rDanaans." \r\rThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious\rfrom the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his\rshoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled\rwithin him. He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as\rdark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow\rin the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their hounds,\rbut presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, and all\rday long the pyres of the dead were burning. \r\rFor nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon\rthe tenth day Achilles called them in assembly- moved thereto by Juno,\rwho saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon\rthem. Then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.\r\r"Son of Atreus," said he, "I deem that we should now turn roving home\rif we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and\rpestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some reader\rof dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why Phoebus\rApollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we have\rbroken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will\raccept the savour of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take\raway the plague from us." \r\rWith these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest of\raugurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He\rit was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius, through\rthe prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With\rall sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:- \r\r"Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger of\rKing Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear\rthat you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that\rI shall offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the\rAchaeans are in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger\rof a king, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge\rtill he has wreaked it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you will\rprotect me." \r\rAnd Achilles answered, "Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon\ryou from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose\roracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his\rhand upon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth-\rno, not though you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost\rof the Achaeans." \r\rThereon the seer spoke boldly. "The god," he said, "is angry neither\rabout vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest\'s sake, whom Agamemnon\rhas dishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take a\rransom for her; therefore has he sent these evils upon us, and will\ryet send others. He will not deliver the Danaans from this pestilence\rtill Agamemnon has restored the girl without fee or ransom to her\rfather, and has sent a holy hecatomb to Chryse. Thus we may perhaps\rappease him." \r\rWith these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His heart\rwas black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on Calchas\rand said, "Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth things concerning\rme, but have ever loved to foretell that which was evil. You have\rbrought me neither comfort nor performance; and now you come seeing\ramong Danaans, and saying that Apollo has plagued us because I would\rnot take a ransom for this girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have set\rmy heart on keeping her in my own house, for I love her better even\rthan my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer she is alike in form and\rfeature, in understanding and accomplishments. Still I will give her\rup if I must, for I would have the people live, not die; but you must\rfind me a prize instead, or I alone among the Argives shall be without\rone. This is not well; for you behold, all of you, that my prize is\rto go elsewhither." \r\rAnd Achilles answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond\rall mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have\rno common store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities\rhave been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made\ralready. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jove grants\rus to sack the city of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold."\r\rThen Agamemnon said, "Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall not\rthus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade\rme. Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss\rand give up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize\rin fair exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, or\rthat of Ajax or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shall\rrue my coming. But of this we will take thought hereafter; for the\rpresent, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her\rexpressly; let us put a hecatomb on board, and let us send Chryseis\ralso; further, let some chief man among us be in command, either Ajax,\ror Idomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you\rare, that we may offer sacrifice and appease the the anger of the\rgod." \r\rAchilles scowled at him and answered, "You are steeped in insolence\rand lust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your\rbidding, either on foray or in open fighting? I came not warring here\rfor any ill the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrel with them.\rThey have not raided my cattle nor my horses, nor cut down my harvests\ron the rich plains of Phthia; for between me and them there is a great\rspace, both mountain and sounding sea. We have followed you, Sir Insolence!\rfor your pleasure, not ours- to gain satisfaction from the Trojans\rfor your shameless self and for Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten\rto rob me of the prize for which I have toiled, and which the sons\rof the Achaeans have given me. Never when the Achaeans sack any rich\rcity of the Trojans do I receive so good a prize as you do, though\rit is my hands that do the better part of the fighting. When the sharing\rcomes, your share is far the largest, and I, forsooth, must go back\rto my ships, take what I can get and be thankful, when my labour of\rfighting is done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will\rbe much better for me to return home with my ships, for I will not\rstay here dishonoured to gather gold and substance for you."\r\rAnd Agamemnon answered, "Fly if you will, I shall make you no prayers\rto stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, and above all\rJove, the lord of counsel. There is no king here so hateful to me\ras you are, for you are ever quarrelsome and ill affected. What though\ryou be brave? Was it not heaven that made you so? Go home, then, with\ryour ships and comrades to lord it over the Myrmidons. I care neither\rfor you nor for your anger; and thus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo\ris taking Chryseis from me, I shall send her with my ship and my followers,\rbut I shall come to your tent and take your own prize Briseis, that\ryou may learn how much stronger I am than you are, and that another\rmay fear to set himself up as equal or comparable with me."\r\rThe son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy breast\rwas divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside, and\rkill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check his anger.\rWhile he was thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from\rits scabbard, Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno had sent her\rin the love she bore to them both), and seized the son of Peleus by\rhis yellow hair, visible to him alone, for of the others no man could\rsee her. Achilles turned in amaze, and by the fire that flashed from\rher eyes at once knew that she was Minerva. "Why are you here," said\rhe, "daughter of aegis-bearing Jove? To see the pride of Agamemnon,\rson of Atreus? Let me tell you- and it shall surely be- he shall pay\rfor this insolence with his life." \r\rAnd Minerva said, "I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to bid\ryou stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of you alike.\rCease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him\rif you will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you- and\rit shall surely be- that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times\ras splendid by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore, and\robey." \r\r"Goddess," answered Achilles, "however angry a man may be, he must\rdo as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hear\rthe prayers of him who has obeyed them." \r\rHe stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust it\rback into the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back to\rOlympus among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing Jove.\r\rBut the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus, for\rhe was still in a rage. "Wine-bibber," he cried, "with the face of\ra dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the host\rin fight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun this\ras you do death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizes\rfrom any man who contradicts you. You devour your people, for you\rare king over a feeble folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforward\ryou would insult no man. Therefore I say, and swear it with a great\roath- nay, by this my sceptre which shalt sprout neither leaf nor\rshoot, nor bud anew from the day on which it left its parent stem\rupon the mountains- for the axe stripped it of leaf and bark, and\rnow the sons of the Achaeans bear it as judges and guardians of the\rdecrees of heaven- so surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter\rthey shall look fondly for Achilles and shall not find him. In the\rday of your distress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand\rof Hector, you shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your\rheart with rage for the hour when you offered insult to the bravest\rof the Achaeans." \r\rWith this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on the\rground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginning fiercely\rfrom his place upon the other side. Then uprose smooth-tongued Nestor,\rthe facile speaker of the Pylians, and the words fell from his lips\rsweeter than honey. Two generations of men born and bred in Pylos\rhad passed away under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third.\rWith all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:-\r\r"Of a truth," he said, "a great sorrow has befallen the Achaean land.\rSurely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans be glad\rat heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are\rso excellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you;\rtherefore be guided by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend\rof men even greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels.\rNever again can I behold such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd\rof his people, or as Caeneus, Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus\rson of Aegeus, peer of the immortals. These were the mightiest men\rever born upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought\rthe fiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them.\rI came from distant Pylos, and went about among them, for they would\rhave me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now living\rcould withstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded\rby them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellent\rway. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girl\raway, for the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to Achilles;\rand you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man who\rby the grace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon.\rYou are strong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon\ris stronger than you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus,\rcheck your anger, I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who\rin the day of battle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans."\r\rAnd Agamemnon answered, "Sir, all that you have said is true, but\rthis fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lord\rof all, king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be.\rGranted that the gods have made him a great warrior, have they also\rgiven him the right to speak with railing?" \r\rAchilles interrupted him. "I should be a mean coward," he cried, "were\rI to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, not me,\rfor I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to\ryour heart- I shall fight neither you nor any man about this girl,\rfor those that take were those also that gave. But of all else that\ris at my ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that others\rmay see; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with your blood."\r\rWhen they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up the\rassembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went back\rto his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company,\rwhile Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of twenty\roarsmen. He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover a hecatomb\rfor the god. And Ulysses went as captain. \r\rThese, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. But\rthe son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they purified\rthemselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they offered hecatombs\rof bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore, and the smoke\rwith the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up towards heaven.\r\rThus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon did\rnot forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trusty\rmessengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. "Go," said he, "to\rthe tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand and\rbring her hither; if he will not give her I shall come with others\rand take her- which will press him harder." \r\rHe charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon they\rwent their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to the tents\rand ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by his tent\rand his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. They stood\rfearfully and reverently before him, and never a word did they speak,\rbut he knew them and said, "Welcome, heralds, messengers of gods and\rmen; draw near; my quarrel is not with you but with Agamemnon who\rhas sent you for the girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus, bring her\rand give her to them, but let them be witnesses by the blessed gods,\rby mortal men, and by the fierceness of Agamemnon\'s anger, that if\rever again there be need of me to save the people from ruin, they\rshall seek and they shall not find. Agamemnon is mad with rage and\rknows not how to look before and after that the Achaeans may fight\rby their ships in safety." \r\rPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseis\rfrom the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with\rthem to the ships of the Achaeans- and the woman was loth to go. Then\rAchilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping and looking\rout upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in prayer\rto his immortal mother, "Mother," he cried, "you bore me doomed to\rlive but for a little season; surely Jove, who thunders from Olympus,\rmight have made that little glorious. It is not so. Agamemnon, son\rof Atreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed me of my prize by\rforce." \r\rAs he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was\rsitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father. Forthwith\rshe rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down before\rhim as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and said, "My\rson, why are you weeping? What is it that grieves you? Keep it not\rfrom me, but tell me, that we may know it together." \r\rAchilles drew a deep sigh and said, "You know it; why tell you what\ryou know well already? We went to Thebe the strong city of Eetion,\rsacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the Achaeans\rshared it duly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis as the\rmeed of Agamemnon; but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to the ships\rof the Achaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him a great\rransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo, wreathed\rwith a suppliant\'s wreath, and he besought the Achaeans, but most\rof all the two sons of Atreus who were their chiefs. \r\r"On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting\rthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,\rwho spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. So he went back\rin anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer. Then\rthe god sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the people died thick\ron one another, for the arrows went everywhither among the wide host\rof the Achaeans. At last a seer in the fulness of his knowledge declared\rto us the oracles of Apollo, and I was myself first to say that we\rshould appease him. Whereon the son of Atreus rose in anger, and threatened\rthat which he has since done. The Achaeans are now taking the girl\rin a ship to Chryse, and sending gifts of sacrifice to the god; but\rthe heralds have just taken from my tent the daughter of Briseus,\rwhom the Achaeans had awarded to myself. \r\r"Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, and\rif you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid\rof Jove. Ofttimes in my father\'s house have I heard you glory in that\ryou alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin, when\rthe others, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have put\rhim in bonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to\rOlympus the hundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but men\rAegaeon, for he is stronger even than his father; when therefore he\rtook his seat all-glorious beside the son of Saturn, the other gods\rwere afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of\rall this, clasp his knees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans.\rLet the Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perish\ron the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of their king,\rand that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult to the\rforemost of the Achaeans." \r\rThetis wept and answered, "My son, woe is me that I should have borne\ror suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span free from\rall sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you\rshould be at once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers:\rwoe, therefore, was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless I will\rgo to the snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove, if\rhe will hear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with your ships,\rnurse your anger against the Achaeans, and hold aloof from fight.\rFor Jove went yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast among the Ethiopians,\rand the other gods went with him. He will return to Olympus twelve\rdays hence; I will then go to his mansion paved with bronze and will\rbeseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able to persuade him."\r\rOn this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had been\rtaken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb.\rWhen they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laid\rthem in the ship\'s hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the\rmast into its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they would\rhave her lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast\rthe hawsers. They then got out upon the sea-shore and landed the hecatomb\rfor Apollo; Chryseis also left the ship, and Ulysses led her to the\raltar to deliver her into the hands of her father. "Chryses," said\rhe, "King Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your child, and\rto offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that we may\rpropitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow upon the Argives."\r\rSo saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her gladly,\rand they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the altar of the\rgod. They washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle\rover the victims, while Chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud\ron their behalf. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of the silver bow, that\rprotectest Chryse and holy Cilla, and rulest Tenedos with thy might.\rEven as thou didst hear me aforetime when I prayed, and didst press\rhardly upon the Achaeans, so hear me yet again, and stay this fearful\rpestilence from the Danaans." \r\rThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done\rpraying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of\rthe victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the thigh-bones,\rwrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat\ron the top of them, and then Chryses laid them on the wood fire and\rpoured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged\rspits in their hands. When the thigh-bones were burned and they had\rtasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces\rupon the spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off:\rthen, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, they\rate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied.\rAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, pages filled the\rmixing-bowl with wine and water and handed it round, after giving\revery man his drink-offering. \r\rThus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning\rhim and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in their\rvoices; but when the sun went down, and it came on dark, they laid\rthemselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship, and when\rthe child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they again set\rsail for the host of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fair wind, so\rthey raised their mast and hoisted their white sails aloft. As the\rsail bellied with the wind the ship flew through the deep blue water,\rand the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. When they\rreached the wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they drew the vessel\rashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath\rher, and went their ways to their own tents and ships. \r\rBut Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not\rto the honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed\rat his own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry. \r\rNow after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to Olympus,\rand Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the charge her son\rhad laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and went through\rgreat heaven with early morning to Olympus, where she found the mighty\rson of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost ridges. She sat herself\rdown before him, and with her left hand seized his knees, while with\rher right she caught him under the chin, and besought him, saying-\r\r"Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the\rimmortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is\rto be cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking\rhis prize and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lord\rof counsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans give\rmy son his due and load him with riches in requital." \r\rJove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still\rkept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time. "Incline\ryour head," said she, "and promise me surely, or else deny me- for\ryou have nothing to fear- that I may learn how greatly you disdain\rme." \r\rAt this Jove was much troubled and answered, "I shall have trouble\rif you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me with\rher taunting speeches; even now she is always railing at me before\rthe other gods and accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back\rnow, lest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and will\rbring it about as wish. See, I incline my head that you believe me.\rThis is the most solemn that I can give to any god. I never recall\rmy word, or deceive, or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded\rmy head." \r\rAs he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the ambrosial\rlocks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus reeled.\r\rWhen the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted- Jove to his\rhouse, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plunged\rinto the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before\rthe coming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting,\rbut all stood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat.\rBut Juno, when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman\'s daughter,\rsilver-footed Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began\rto upbraid him. "Trickster," she cried, "which of the gods have you\rbeen taking into your counsels now? You are always settling matters\rin secret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could\rhelp it, one word of your intentions." \r\r"Juno," replied the sire of gods and men, "you must not expect to\rbe informed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find\rit hard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there\ris no one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to\rkeep a matter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions."\r\r"Dread son of Saturn," answered Juno, "what are you talking about?\rI? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in everything.\rStill, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman\'s daughter Thetis\rhas been talking you over, for she was with you and had hold of your\rknees this self-same morning. I believe, therefore, that you have\rbeen promising her to give glory to Achilles, and to kill much people\rat the ships of the Achaeans." \r\r"Wife," said Jove, "I can do nothing but you suspect me and find it\rout. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you the\rmore, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you say;\rI mean to have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bid you for\rif I once begin to lay my hands about you, though all heaven were\ron your side it would profit you nothing." \r\rOn this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and sat\rdown in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughout\rthe house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try and\rpacify his mother Juno. "It will be intolerable," said he, "if you\rtwo fall to wrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack\rof mortals. If such ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no\rpleasure at our banquet. Let me then advise my mother- and she must\rherself know that it will be better- to make friends with my dear\rfather Jove, lest he again scold her and disturb our feast. If the\rOlympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from our seats, he can do\rso, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair words, and he will\rthen soon be in a good humour with us." \r\rAs he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his\rmother\'s hand. "Cheer up, my dear mother," said he, "and make the\rbest of it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you\rget a thrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not help for\rthere is no standing against Jove. Once before when I was trying to\rhelp you, he caught me by the foot and flung me from the heavenly\rthreshold. All day long from morn till eve, was I falling, till at\rsunset I came to ground in the island of Lemnos, and there I lay,\rwith very little life left in me, till the Sintians came and tended\rme." \r\rJuno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her son\'s\rhands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and served\rit round among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed\rgods laughed out a loud applause as they saw him ing bustling about\rthe heavenly mansion. \r\rThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted,\rand every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied. Apollo\rstruck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices, calling\rand answering one another. But when the sun\'s glorious light had faded,\rthey went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame Vulcan with\rhis consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove, the Olympian\rLord of Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he always slept; and\rwhen he had got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the golden\rthrone by his side. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK II\r\rNow the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept soundly,\rbut Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour to Achilles,\rand destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. In the end\rhe deemed it would be best to send a lying dream to King Agamemnon;\rso he called one to him and said to it, "Lying Dream, go to the ships\rof the Achaeans, into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to him word to\rword as I now bid you. Tell him to get the Achaeans instantly under\rarms, for he shall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels\ramong the gods; Juno has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides\rthe Trojans." \r\rThe dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached the\rships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found\rhim in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his\rhead in the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honoured\rabove all his councillors, and said:- \r\r"You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his host\rand so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear\rme at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who, though he be\rnot near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get\rthe Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There\rare no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them\rover to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of\rJove. Remember this, and when you wake see that it does not escape\ryou." \r\rThe dream then left him, and he thought of things that were, surely\rnot to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day he was to\rtake the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mind of\rJove, who had many another hard-fought fight in store alike for Danaans\rand Trojans. Then presently he woke, with the divine message still\rringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and put on his soft shirt\rso fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak. He bound his sandals\ron to his comely feet, and slung his silver-studded sword about his\rshoulders; then he took the imperishable staff of his father, and\rsallied forth to the ships of the Achaeans. \r\rThe goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might\rherald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sent\rthe criers round to call the people in assembly; so they called them\rand the people gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting of\rthe elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they were\rassembled he laid a cunning counsel before them. \r\r"My friends," said he, "I have had a dream from heaven in the dead\rof night, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor\'s. It\rhovered over my head and said, \'You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one\rwho has the welfare of his host and so much other care upon his shoulders\rshould dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger from\rJove, who, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities\ryou. He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall\rtake Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno\rhas brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans\rat the hands of Jove. Remember this.\' The dream then vanished and\rI awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons of the Achaeans. But\rit will be well that I should first sound them, and to this end I\rwill tell them to fly with their ships; but do you others go about\ramong the host and prevent their doing so." \r\rHe then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all sincerity\rand goodwill addressed them thus: "My friends," said he, "princes\rand councillors of the Argives, if any other man of the Achaeans had\rtold us of this dream we should have declared it false, and would\rhave had nothing to do with it. But he who has seen it is the foremost\rman among us; we must therefore set about getting the people under\rarms." \r\rWith this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptred\rkings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the\rpeople pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally\rfrom some hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the spring\rflowers, bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mighty multitude\rpour from ships and tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon\rthe wide-watered shore, while among them ran Wildfire Rumour, messenger\rof Jove, urging them ever to the fore. Thus they gathered in a pell-mell\rof mad confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as\rthe people sought their places. Nine heralds went crying about among\rthem to stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till at\rlast they were got into their several places and ceased their clamour.\rThen King Agamemnon rose, holding his sceptre. This was the work of\rVulcan, who gave it to Jove the son of Saturn. Jove gave it to Mercury,\rslayer of Argus, guide and guardian. King Mercury gave it to Pelops,\rthe mighty charioteer, and Pelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people.\rAtreus, when he died, left it to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes\rin his turn left it to be borne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord\rof all Argos and of the isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed\rthe Argives. \r\r"My friends," he said, "heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heaven\rhas been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise\rthat I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he has\rplayed me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos\rwith the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laid\rmany a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his\rpower is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter that an Achaean\rhost, at once so great and valiant, battled in vain against men fewer\rin number than themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight. Think\rthat the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and\rthat they have each been numbered- the Trojans by the roll of their\rhouseholders, and we by companies of ten; think further that each\rof our companies desired to have a Trojan householder to pour out\rtheir wine; we are so greatly more in number that full many a company\rwould have to go without its cup-bearer. But they have in the town\rallies from other places, and it is these that hinder me from being\rable to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine of Jove years are gone;\rthe timbers of our ships have rotted; their tackling is sound no longer.\rOur wives and little ones at home look anxiously for our coming, but\rthe work that we came hither to do has not been done. Now, therefore,\rlet us all do as I say: let us sail back to our own land, for we shall\rnot take Troy." \r\rWith these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of\rthem as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to\rand fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and south\rwinds break from heaven\'s clouds to lash them; or as when the west\rwind sweeps over a field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast,\reven so were they swayed as they flew with loud cries towards the\rships, and the dust from under their feet rose heavenward. They cheered\reach other on to draw the ships into the sea; they cleared the channels\rin front of them; they began taking away the stays from underneath\rthem, and the welkin rang with their glad cries, so eager were they\rto return. \r\rThen surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that was\rnot fated. But Juno said to Minerva, "Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing\rJove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their own land over\rthe broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still\rkeeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at\rTroy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host, and speak\rfairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships into the\rsea." \r\rMinerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the\rtopmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of\rthe Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, standing\ralone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he was grieved\rand sorry; so she went close up to him and said, "Ulysses, noble son\rof Laertes, are you going to fling yourselves into your ships and\rbe off home to your own land in this way? Will you leave Priam and\rthe Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many\rof the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about\rat once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man, that\rthey draw not their ships into the sea." \r\rUlysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak\rfrom him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca,\rwho waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses went\rstraight up to Agamemnon and received from him his ancestral, imperishable\rstaff. With this he went about among the ships of the Achaeans.\r\rWhenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke him\rfairly. "Sir," said he, "this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Stand\rto your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do not\ryet know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and ere long\rwill visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all of us\rat the council to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be angry\rand do us a mischief; for the pride of kings is great, and the hand\rof Jove is with them." \r\rBut when he came across any common man who was making a noise, he\rstruck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, "Sirrah, hold your\rpeace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a coward and\rno soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannot all\rbe kings; it is not well that there should be many masters; one man\rmust be supreme- one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn has given\rthe sceptre of sovereignty over you all." \r\rThus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people hurried\rback to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as the\rthunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, and all\rthe sea is in an uproar. \r\rThe rest now took their seats and kept to their own several places,\rbut Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue- a man of\rmany words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a railer against\rall who were in authority, who cared not what he said, so that he\rmight set the Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliest man of all those\rthat came before Troy- bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two\rshoulders rounded and hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a\rpoint, but there was little hair on the top of it. Achilles and Ulysses\rhated him worst of all, for it was with them that he was most wont\rto wrangle; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice he began heaping\rhis abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry and disgusted, yet\rnone the less he kept on brawling and bawling at the son of Atreus.\r\r"Agamemnon," he cried, "what ails you now, and what more do you want?\rYour tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for whenever\rwe take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you have yet more\rgold, which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his son, when\rI or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some young girl\rto hide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler of the Achaeans,\rshould bring them into such misery. Weakling cowards, women rather\rthan men, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here at Troy to\rstew in his own meeds of honour, and discover whether we were of any\rservice to him or no. Achilles is a much better man than he is, and\rsee how he has treated him- robbing him of his prize and keeping it\rhimself. Achilles takes it meekly and shows no fight; if he did, son\rof Atreus, you would never again insult him." \r\rThus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and rebuked\rhim sternly. "Check your glib tongue, Thersites," said be, "and babble\rnot a word further. Chide not with princes when you have none to back\ryou. There is no viler creature come before Troy with the sons of\rAtreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile them nor\rkeep harping about going home. We do not yet know how things are going\rto be, nor whether the Achaeans are to return with good success or\revil. How dare you gibe at Agamemnon because the Danaans have awarded\rhim so many prizes? I tell you, therefore- and it shall surely be-\rthat if I again catch you talking such nonsense, I will either forfeit\rmy own head and be no more called father of Telemachus, or I will\rtake you, strip you stark naked, and whip you out of the assembly\rtill you go blubbering back to the ships." \r\rOn this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders till\rhe dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a bloody\rweal on his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish\ras he wiped the tears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him,\ryet they laughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying,\r"Ulysses has done many a good thing ere now in fight and council,\rbut he never did the Argives a better turn than when he stopped this\rfellow\'s mouth from prating further. He will give the kings no more\rof his insolence." \r\rThus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and Minerva\rin the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that those who\rwere far off might hear him and consider his council. He therefore\rwith all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:- \r\r"King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among all\rmankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set out from\rArgos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town of\rTroy, and, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would set\roff homeward. True it is that they have had toil enough to be disheartened.\rA man chafes at having to stay away from his wife even for a single\rmonth, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but\rit is now nine long years that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore,\rblame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed\rif we go home empty after so long a stay- therefore, my friends, be\rpatient yet a little longer that we may learn whether the prophesyings\rof Calchas were false or true. \r\r"All who have not since perished must remember as though it were yesterday\ror the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were detained in\rAulis when we were on our way hither to make war on Priam and the\rTrojans. We were ranged round about a fountain offering hecatombs\rto the gods upon their holy altars, and there was a fine plane-tree\rfrom beneath which there welled a stream of pure water. Then we saw\ra prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful serpent out of the ground, with\rblood-red stains upon its back, and it darted from under the altar\ron to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood of young sparrows, quite\rsmall, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from under the leaves,\reight in all, and their mother that hatched them made nine. The serpent\rate the poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew about lamenting\rher little ones; but the serpent threw his coils about her and caught\rher by the wing as she was screaming. Then, when he had eaten both\rthe sparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him become\ra sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turned him into stone, and\rwe stood there wondering at that which had come to pass. Seeing, then,\rthat such a fearful portent had broken in upon our hecatombs, Calchas\rforthwith declared to us the oracles of heaven. \'Why, Achaeans,\' said\rhe, \'are you thus speechless? Jove has sent us this sign, long in\rcoming, and long ere it be fulfilled, though its fame shall last for\rever. As the serpent ate the eight fledglings and the sparrow that\rhatched them, which makes nine, so shall we fight nine years at Troy,\rbut in the tenth shall take the town.\' This was what he said, and\rnow it is all coming true. Stay here, therefore, all of you, till\rwe take the city of Priam." \r\rOn this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with\rthe uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. "Shame\ron you," he cried, "to stay talking here like children, when you should\rfight like men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that\rwe have taken? Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with our\rdrink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we have\rput our trust? We waste our time in words, and for all our talking\rhere shall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son of Atreus,\rby your own steadfast purpose; lead the Argives on to battle, and\rleave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain,\rto get back to Argos ere they have learned whether Jove be true or\ra liar. For the mighty son of Saturn surely promised that we should\rsucceed, when we Argives set sail to bring death and destruction upon\rthe Trojans. He showed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning\ron our right hands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has\rfirst lain with the wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and\rsorrow that he has suffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless, if\rany man is in such haste to be at home again, let him lay his hand\rto his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight of all. But, O\rking, consider and give ear to my counsel, for the word that I say\rmay not be neglected lightly. Divide your men, Agamemnon, into their\rseveral tribes and clans, that clans and tribes may stand by and help\rone another. If you do this, and if the Achaeans obey you, you will\rfind out who, both chiefs and peoples, are brave, and who are cowards;\rfor they will vie against the other. Thus you shall also learn whether\rit is through the counsel of heaven or the cowardice of man that you\rshall fail to take the town." \r\rAnd Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, you have again outdone the sons of\rthe Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo,\rthat I had among them ten more such councillors, for the city of King\rPriam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it.\rBut the son of Saturn afflicts me with bootless wranglings and strife.\rAchilles and I are quarrelling about this girl, in which matter I\rwas the first to offend; if we can be of one mind again, the Trojans\rwill not stave off destruction for a day. Now, therefore, get your\rmorning meal, that our hosts join in fight. Whet well your spears;\rsee well to the ordering of your shields; give good feeds to your\rhorses, and look your chariots carefully over, that we may do battle\rthe livelong day; for we shall have no rest, not for a moment, till\rnight falls to part us. The bands that bear your shields shall be\rwet with the sweat upon your shoulders, your hands shall weary upon\ryour spears, your horses shall steam in front of your chariots, and\rif I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it at\rthe ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey\rto dogs and vultures." \r\rThus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the waves\rrun high before the blast of the south wind and break on some lofty\rheadland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as\rthe storms from every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeans\rrise and hurry in all directions to their ships. There they lighted\rtheir fires at their tents and got dinner, offering sacrifice every\rman to one or other of the gods, and praying each one of them that\rhe might live to come out of the fight. Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed\ra fat five-year-old bull to the mighty son of Saturn, and invited\rthe princes and elders of his host. First he asked Nestor and King\rIdomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and sixthly\rUlysses, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his own accord,\rfor he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood round the bull\rwith the barley-meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed, saying,\r"Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven, and ridest\rupon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, nor the\rnight fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low, and its gates are\rconsumed with fire. Grant that my sword may pierce the shirt of Hector\rabout his heart, and that full many of his comrades may bite the dust\ras they fall dying round him." \r\rThus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer.\rHe accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toil\rcontinually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal\rupon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayed\rit. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers\rof fat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. These they\rburned upon the split logs of firewood, but they spitted the inward\rmeats, and held them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-bones were\rburned, and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up\rsmall, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done,\rand drew them off; then, when they had finished their work and the\rfeast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so\rthat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\rdrink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. "King Agamemnon,"\rsaid he, "let us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the work that\rheaven has put into our hands. Let the heralds summon the people to\rgather at their several ships; we will then go about among the host,\rthat we may begin fighting at once." \r\rThus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent\rthe criers round to call the people in assembly. So they called them,\rand the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son of Atreus\rchose their men and marshalled them, while Minerva went among them\rholding her priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death. From\rit there waved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven, and\reach one of them worth a hundred oxen. With this she darted furiously\reverywhere among the hosts of the Achaeans, urging them forward, and\rputting courage into the heart of each, so that he might fight and\rdo battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeter in their eyes even\rthan returning home in their ships. As when some great forest fire\ris raging upon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even so\ras they marched the gleam of their armour flashed up into the firmament\rof heaven. \r\rThey were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the plain\rabout the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither and thither,\rglorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle till the\rfen is alive with their screaming. Even thus did their tribes pour\rfrom ships and tents on to the plain of the Scamander, and the ground\rrang as brass under the feet of men and horses. They stood as thick\rupon the flower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom in summer.\r\rAs countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman\'s homestead in\rthe time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even so\rdid the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans and destroy\rthem. \r\rThe chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight began,\rdrafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their flocks when they\rhave got mixed while feeding; and among them went King Agamemnon,\rwith a head and face like Jove the lord of thunder, a waist like Mars,\rand a chest like that of Neptune. As some great bull that lords it\rover the herds upon the plain, even so did Jove make the son of Atreus\rstand peerless among the multitude of heroes. \r\rAnd now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me- for\ryou are goddesses and are in all places so that you see all things,\rwhile we know nothing but by report- who were the chiefs and princes\rof the Danaans? As for the common soldiers, they were so that I could\rnot name every single one of them though I had ten tongues, and though\rmy voice failed not and my heart were of bronze within me, unless\ryou, O Olympian Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, were to recount\rthem to me. Nevertheless, I will tell the captains of the ships and\rall the fleet together. \r\rPeneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were captains\rof the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis,\rand who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of Eteonus, with\rThespeia, Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They also held Harma,\rEilesium, and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea\rand the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the\rhaunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and\rGlisas; the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus with its famous\rgrove of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and\rAnthedon upon the sea. From these there came fifty ships, and in each\rthere were a hundred and twenty young men of the Boeotians.\r\rAscalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt in\rAspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noble maiden\rbore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had gone with\rMars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain with her. With\rthese there came thirty ships. \r\rThe Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty\rIphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus,\rrocky Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt\rin Anemorea and Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus,\rand Lilaea by the springs of the Cephissus; with their chieftains\rcame forty ships, and they marshalled the forces of the Phoceans,\rwhich were stationed next to the Boeotians, on their left.\r\rAjax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not\rso great, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was\ra little man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of\rthe spear he excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt\rin Cynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae, Tarphe, and\rThronium about the river Boagrius. With him there came forty ships\rof the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea. \r\rThe fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria,\rHistiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the rock-perched\rtown of Dium; with them were also the men of Carystus and Styra; Elephenor\rof the race of Mars was in command of these; he was son of Chalcodon,\rand chief over all the Abantes. With him they came, fleet of foot\rand wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, who would ever\rstrive to tear open the corslets of their foes with their long ashen\rspears. Of these there came fifty ships. \r\rAnd they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of great\rErechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove\'s daughter,\rMinerva, fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own rich\rsanctuary. There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship him with\rsacrifices of bulls and rams. These were commanded by Menestheus,\rson of Peteos. No man living could equal him in the marshalling of\rchariots and foot soldiers. Nestor could alone rival him, for he was\rolder. With him there came fifty ships. \r\rAjax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongside\rthose of the Athenians. \r\rThe men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns, with\rHermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and the vineyard\rlands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who came from Aegina\rand Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loud battle-cry, and Sthenelus\rson of famed Capaneus. With them in command was Euryalus, son of king\rMecisteus, son of Talaus; but Diomed was chief over them all. With\rthese there came eighty ships. \r\rThose who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae;\rOrneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old; Hyperesia,\rhigh Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coast-land round about\rHelice; these sent a hundred ships under the command of King Agamemnon,\rson of Atreus. His force was far both finest and most numerous, and\rin their midst was the king himself, all glorious in his armour of\rgleaming bronze- foremost among the heroes, for he was the greatest\rking, and had most men under him. \r\rAnd those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills, Pharis,\rSparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae, Amyclae, and\rHelos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus; these were led by\rMenelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, and of them\rthere were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others. Among them\rwent Menelaus himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to fight; for\rhe longed to avenge the toil and sorrow that he had suffered for the\rsake of Helen. \r\rThe men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of the river\rAlpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum, Helos,\rand Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled his minstrelsy\rfor ever. He was returning from Oechalia, where Eurytus lived and\rreigned, and boasted that he would surpass even the Muses, daughters\rof aegis-bearing Jove, if they should sing against him; whereon they\rwere angry, and maimed him. They robbed him of his divine power of\rsong, and thenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. These were\rcommanded by Nestor, knight of Gerene, and with him there came ninety\rships. \r\rAnd those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene, near\rthe tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand; the men\rof Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of Rhipae, Stratie,\rand bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelus and Parrhasia;\rof these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus was commander, and they had\rsixty ships. Many Arcadians, good soldiers, came in each one of them,\rbut Agamemnon found them the ships in which to cross the sea, for\rthey were not a people that occupied their business upon the waters.\r\rThe men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as is enclosed\rbetween Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rock Olene and Alesium.\rThese had four leaders, and each of them had ten ships, with many\rEpeans on board. Their captains were Amphimachus and Thalpius- the\rone, son of Cteatus, and the other, of Eurytus- both of the race of\rActor. The two others were Diores, son of Amarynces, and Polyxenus,\rson of King Agasthenes, son of Augeas. \r\rAnd those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who dwelt\rbeyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Mars, and\rthe son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who quarrelled with his\rfather, and went to settle in Dulichium. With him there came forty\rships. \r\rUlysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum with\rits forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus, with\rthe mainland also that was over against the islands. These were led\rby Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, and with him there came twelve\rships. \r\rThoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in Pleuron,\rOlenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, for the great\rking Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, as was also\rgolden-haired Meleager, who had been set over the Aetolians to be\rtheir king. And with Thoas there came forty ships. \r\rThe famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus,\rand the well-walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus and Lycastus\rthat lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestus and Rhytium,\rwith the other peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities of Crete.\rAll these were led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer of murderous\rMars. And with these there came eighty ships. \r\rTlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large of stature,\rbrought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. These dwelt in\rRhodes which is divided among the three cities of Lindus, Ielysus,\rand Cameirus, that lies upon the chalk. These were commanded by Tlepolemus,\rson of Hercules by Astyochea, whom he had carried off from Ephyra,\ron the river Selleis, after sacking many cities of valiant warriors.\rWhen Tlepolemus grew up, he killed his father\'s uncle Licymnius, who\rhad been a famous warrior in his time, but was then grown old. On\rthis he built himself a fleet, gathered a great following, and fled\rbeyond the sea, for he was menaced by the other sons and grandsons\rof Hercules. After a voyage. during which he suffered great hardship,\rhe came to Rhodes, where the people divided into three communities,\raccording to their tribes, and were dearly loved by Jove, the lord,\rof gods and men; wherefore the son of Saturn showered down great riches\rupon them. \r\rAnd Nireus brought three ships from Syme- Nireus, who was the handsomest\rman that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus-\rbut he was a man of no substance, and had but a small following.\r\rAnd those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, the city\rof Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were commanded by Pheidippus\rand Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus the son of Hercules. And\rwith them there came thirty ships. \r\rThose again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; and\rthose of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were called\rMyrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships, over which\rAchilles was in command. But they now took no part in the war, inasmuch\ras there was no one to marshal them; for Achilles stayed by his ships,\rfurious about the loss of the girl Briseis, whom he had taken from\rLyrnessus at his own great peril, when he had sacked Lyrnessus and\rThebe, and had overthrown Mynes and Epistrophus, sons of king Evenor,\rson of Selepus. For her sake Achilles was still grieving, but ere\rlong he was again to join them. \r\rAnd those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus, sanctuary\rof Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the sea, and Pteleum\rthat lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave Protesilaus had been\rcaptain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying under the earth.\rHe had left a wife behind him in Phylace to tear her cheeks in sorrow,\rand his house was only half finished, for he was slain by a Dardanian\rwarrior while leaping foremost of the Achaeans upon the soil of Troy.\rStill, though his people mourned their chieftain, they were not without\ra leader, for Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalled them; he was\rson of Iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son of Phylacus, and he\rwas own brother to Protesilaus, only younger, Protesilaus being at\ronce the elder and the more valiant. So the people were not without\ra leader, though they mourned him whom they had lost. With him there\rcame forty ships. \r\rAnd those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe, Glaphyrae,\rand the populous city of Iolcus, these with their eleven ships were\rled by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis bore to him, loveliest\rof the daughters of Pelias. \r\rAnd those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea and rugged\rOlizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, and they\rhad seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them good archers;\rbut Philoctetes was lying in great pain in the Island of Lemnos, where\rthe sons of the Achaeans left him, for he had been bitten by a poisonous\rwater snake. There he lay sick and sorry, and full soon did the Argives\rcome to miss him. But his people, though they felt his loss were not\rleaderless, for Medon, the bastard son of Oileus by Rhene, set them\rin array. \r\rThose, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and they that\rheld Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these were commanded\rby the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art of healing, Podalirius\rand Machaon. And with them there came thirty ships. \r\rThe men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia, with\rthose that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus, these were\rled by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them there came forty\rships. \r\rThose that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white city\rof Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was son of Pirithous,\rwho was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia bore him to Pirithous\ron the day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountain savages\rand drove them from Mt. Pelion to the Aithices. But Polypoetes was\rnot sole in command, for with him was Leonteus, of the race of Mars,\rwho was son of Coronus, the son of Caeneus. And with these there came\rforty ships. \r\rGuneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was followed\rby the Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about wintry Dodona,\rand held the lands round the lovely river Titaresius, which sends\rits waters into the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silver eddies\rof the Peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; for the Titaresius\ris a branch of dread Orcus and of the river Styx. \r\rOf the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They were\rthey that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion. Prothous, fleet\rof foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty ships.\r\rSuch were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, O Muse,\rwas the foremost, whether man or horse, among those that followed\rafter the sons of Atreus? \r\rOf the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest.\rThey were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They were\rof the same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo,\rof the silver bow, had bred them in Perea- both of them mares, and\rterrible as Mars in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, was\rmuch the foremost so long as Achilles\' anger lasted, for Achilles\rexcelled him greatly and he had also better horses; but Achilles was\rnow holding aloof at his ships by reason of his quarrel with Agamemnon,\rand his people passed their time upon the sea shore, throwing discs\ror aiming with spears at a mark, and in archery. Their horses stood\reach by his own chariot, champing lotus and wild celery. The chariots\rwere housed under cover, but their owners, for lack of leadership,\rwandered hither and thither about the host and went not forth to fight.\r\rThus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groaned\rbeneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the land\rabout Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Even\rso did the earth groan beneath them as they sped over the plain.\r\rAnd now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the bad\rnews among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young,\rat Priam\'s gates, and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with the\rvoice of Priam\'s son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, was stationed\ras watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aesyetes, to look out\rfor any sally of the Achaeans. In his likeness Iris spoke, saying,\r"Old man, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while war is at hand.\rI have been in many a battle, but never yet saw such a host as is\rnow advancing. They are crossing the plain to attack the city as thick\ras leaves or as the sands of the sea. Hector, I charge you above all\rothers, do as I say. There are many allies dispersed about the city\rof Priam from distant places and speaking divers tongues. Therefore,\rlet each chief give orders to his own people, setting them severally\rin array and leading them forth to battle." \r\rThus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at once\rbroke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates were opened,\rand the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with the tramp\ras of a great multitude. \r\rNow there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon the\rplain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb\rof lithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided their forces.\r\rPriam\'s son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the Trojans,\rand with him were arrayed by far the greater number and most valiant\rof those who were longing for the fray. \r\rThe Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore to Anchises,\rwhen she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon the mountain\rslopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the two sons of\rAntenor, Archilochus and Acamas, both skilled in all the arts of war.\r\rThey that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men of\rsubstance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are of\rTrojan blood- these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom Apollo\rhad taught to use the bow. \r\rThey that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia, and\rthe high mountain of Tereia- these were led by Adrestus and Amphius,\rwhose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Merops of Percote,\rwho excelled in all kinds of divination. He told them not to take\rpart in the war, but they gave him no heed, for fate lured them to\rdestruction. \r\rThey that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos, and\rArisbe- these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave commander-\rAsius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, of\rthe breed that comes from the river Selleis, had brought from Arisbe.\r\rHippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in fertile\rLarissa- Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sons of\rthe Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus. \r\rAcamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and those that\rcame from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont. \r\rEuphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of the Ciconian\rspearsmen. \r\rPyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the broad\rwaters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the earth.\r\rThe Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from\rEnetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that held\rCytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the river\rParthenius, Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini. \r\rOdius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distant\rAlybe, where there are mines of silver. \r\rChromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill in\raugury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by the\rhand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he slew\rothers also of the Trojans. \r\rPhorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far\rcountry of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray. \r\rMesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes,\rborn to him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Meonians, who dwelt\runder Mt. Tmolus. \r\rNastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held Miletus\rand the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of the river Maeander\rand the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These were commanded by Nastes\rand Amphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He came into the fight\rwith gold about him, like a girl; fool that he was, his gold was of\rno avail to save him, for he fell in the river by the hand of the\rfleet descendant of Aeacus, and Achilles bore away his gold.\r\rSarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by the\reddying waters of the Xanthus. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK III\r\rWhen the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain,\rthe Trojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that scream\roverhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing waters of\rOceanus to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies, and they wrangle\rin the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched silently, in high\rheart, and minded to stand by one another. \r\rAs when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain\rtops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man\rcan see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust\rfrom under their feet as they made all speed over the plain.\r\rWhen they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward\ras champion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin\rof a panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears\rshod with bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to\rmeet him in single fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before\rthe ranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase\rof some goat or horned stag, and devours it there and then, though\rdogs and youths set upon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his\reyes caught sight of Alexandrus, for he deemed that now he should\rbe revenged. He sprang, therefore, from his chariot, clad in his suit\rof armour. \r\rAlexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in\rfear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back affrighted,\rtrembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some\rmountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into the throng of Trojan\rwarriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the son Atreus.\r\rThen Hector upbraided him. "Paris," said he, "evil-hearted Paris,\rfair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had\rnever been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live\rto be disgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock\rat us and say that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to\rsee but who has neither wit nor courage? Did you not, such as you\rare, get your following together and sail beyond the seas? Did you\rnot from your a far country carry off a lovely woman wedded among\ra people of warriors- to bring sorrow upon your father, your city,\rand your whole country, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness\rto yourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what\rmanner of man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would\rbe your lyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair\rfavour, when you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are\ra weak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones\rfor the wrongs you have done them." \r\rAnd Alexandrus answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just. You are hard\ras the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the\rtimber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge\rof your scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus\rhas given me; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the\rgods give them where they are minded, and none can have them for the\rasking. If you would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid the Trojans\rand Achaeans take their seats, while he and I fight in their midst\rfor Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and\rprove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear\rthem to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace\rwhereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the others go home\rto Argos and the land of the Achaeans." \r\rWhen Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan\rranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and they\rall sat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed at him with\rstones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying, "Hold, Argives,\rshoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to speak."\r\rThey ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. "Hear\rfrom my mouth," said he, "Trojans and Achaeans, the saying of Alexandrus,\rthrough whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and\rAchaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he and Menelaus fight\rin the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall\rbe victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all\rshe has, to bear them to his own home, but let the rest swear to a\rsolemn covenant of peace." \r\rThus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of the\rloud battle-cry addressed them. "And now," he said, "hear me too,\rfor it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of\rAchaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much\rhave suffered for my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he did\rme. Let him who shall die, die, and let the others fight no more.\rBring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for Earth and\rSun, and we will bring a third for Jove. Moreover, you shall bid Priam\rcome, that he may swear to the covenant himself; for his sons are\rhigh-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Jove must not be transgressed\ror taken in vain. Young men\'s minds are light as air, but when an\rold man comes he looks before and after, deeming that which shall\rbe fairest upon both sides." \r\rThe Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they\rthought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariots\rtoward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying\rit down upon the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with\ra little space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city\rto bring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybius\rto fetch the other lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon had\rsaid. \r\rMeanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law, wife\rof the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had married Laodice,\rthe fairest of Priam\'s daughters. She found her in her own room, working\rat a great web of purple linen, on which she was embroidering the\rbattles between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars had made them fight\rfor her sake. Iris then came close up to her and said, "Come hither,\rchild, and see the strange doings of the Trojans and Achaeans till\rnow they have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle,\rbut now they have left off fighting, and are leaning upon their shields,\rsitting still with their spears planted beside them. Alexandrus and\rMenelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are to the the\rwife of him who is the victor." \r\rThus spoke the goddess, and Helen\'s heart yearned after her former\rhusband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over\rher head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone,\rbut attended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus,\rand Clymene. And straightway they were at the Scaean gates.\r\rThe two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were seated\rby the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus, Clytius,\rand Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old to fight, but\rthey were fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales that chirrup\rdelicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood. When they\rsaw Helen coming towards the tower, they said softly to one another,\r"Small wonder that Trojans and Achaeans should endure so much and\rso long, for the sake of a woman so marvellously and divinely lovely.\rStill, fair though she be, let them take her and go, or she will breed\rsorrow for us and for our children after us." \r\rBut Priam bade her draw nigh. "My child," said he, "take your seat\rin front of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmen\rand your friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you\rwho are to blame. It is they that have brought about this terrible\rwar with the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great\rand goodly? I have seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and\rso royal. Surely he must be a king." \r\r"Sir," answered Helen, "father of my husband, dear and reverend in\rmy eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here\rwith your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling\rdaughter, and all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to\rbe, and my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, the\rhero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and\ra brave soldier, brother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to my\rabhorred and miserable self." \r\rThe old man marvelled at him and said, "Happy son of Atreus, child\rof good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in great\rmultitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people\rof Otreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river\rSangarius; I was their ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers\rof men, came up against them, but even they were not so many as the\rAchaeans." \r\rThe old man next looked upon Ulysses; "Tell me," he said, "who is\rthat other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the\rchest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalks\rin front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his\rewes." \r\rAnd Helen answered, "He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of Laertes.\rHe was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner of stratagems\rand subtle cunning." \r\rOn this Antenor said, "Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once\rcame here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I received\rthem in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and\rconversation. When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans,\rMenelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysses\rhad the more royal presence. After a time they delivered their message,\rand the speech of Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he did not\rsay much, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke very clearly\rand to the point, though he was the younger man of the two; Ulysses,\ron the other hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silent and\rkept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor graceful\rmovement of his sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a man\runpractised in oratory- one might have taken him for a mere churl\ror simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came driving\rfrom his deep chest like winter snow before the wind, then there was\rnone to touch him, and no man thought further of what he looked like."\r\rPriam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, "Who is that great and\rgoodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest\rof the Argives?" \r\r"That," answered Helen, "is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, and\ron the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus looking\rlike a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him. Often\rdid Menelaus receive him as a guest in our house when he came visiting\rus from Crete. I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose names I\rcould tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor,\rbreaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer; they are children\rof my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they have not left\rLacedaemon, or else, though they have brought their ships, they will\rnot show themselves in battle for the shame and disgrace that I have\rbrought upon them." \r\rShe knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the earth\rin their own land of Lacedaemon. \r\rMeanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings through\rthe city- two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth; and\rIdaeus brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up to\rPriam and said, "Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans and Achaeans\rbid you come down on to the plain and swear to a solemn covenant.\rAlexandrus and Menelaus are to fight for Helen in single combat, that\rshe and all her wealth may go with him who is the victor. We are to\rswear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby we others shall dwell\rhere in Troy, while the Achaeans return to Argos and the land of the\rAchaeans." \r\rThe old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the\rhorses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot,\rgathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside him;\rthey then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. When they\rreached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left the chariot,\rand with measured pace advanced into the space between the hosts.\r\rAgamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants brought\ron the oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they\rpoured water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus\rdrew the dagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs\'\rheads; this the men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaean\rprinces, and the son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer. "Father\rJove," he cried, "that rulest in Ida, most glorious in power, and\rthou oh Sun, that seest and givest ear to all things, Earth and Rivers,\rand ye who in the realms below chastise the soul of him that has broken\rhis oath, witness these rites and guard them, that they be not vain.\rIf Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen and all her wealth,\rwhile we sail home with our ships; but if Menelaus kills Alexandrus,\rlet the Trojans give back Helen and all that she has; let them moreover\rpay such fine to the Achaeans as shall be agreed upon, in testimony\ramong those that shall be born hereafter. Aid if Priam and his sons\rrefuse such fine when Alexandrus has fallen, then will I stay here\rand fight on till I have got satisfaction." \r\rAs he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, and\rlaid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife had\rreft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl\rinto the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying, Trojans\rand Achaeans among one another, "Jove, most great and glorious, and\rye other everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them who shall\rfirst sin against their oaths- of them and their children- may be\rshed upon the ground even as this wine, and let their wives become\rthe slaves of strangers." \r\rThus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.\rThen Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, "Hear me, Trojans\rand Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius:\rI dare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and\rMenelaus, for Jove and the other immortals alone know which shall\rfall." \r\rOn this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. He\rgathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the two\rthen went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, and\rcast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim first.\rMeanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed saying, "Father\rJove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, grant that he\rwho first brought about this war between us may die, and enter the\rhouse of Hades, while we others remain at peace and abide by our oaths."\r\rGreat Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,\rand the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several\rstations, each by his horses and the place where his arms were lying,\rwhile Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodly armour.\rFirst he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fitted with\rancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of his brother\rLycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung his silver-studded\rsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On\rhis comely head he set his helmet, well-wrought, with a crest of horse-hair\rthat nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped a redoubtable spear\rthat suited his hands. In like fashion Menelaus also put on his armour.\r\rWhen they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode fierce\rof aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeans were\rstruck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on\rthe measured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against\rthe other. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck the round shield of\rthe son of Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield\rturned its point. Menelaus next took aim, praying to Father Jove as\rhe did so. "King Jove," he said, "grant me revenge on Alexandrus who\rhas wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in ages yet to come\ra man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house of his host."\r\rHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of Alexandrus.\rThrough shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirt by his flank,\rbut Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life. Then the son\rof Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projecting part of his\rhelmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or four pieces from his\rhand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, "Father Jove, of all gods\rthou art the most despiteful; I made sure of my revenge, but the sword\rhas broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and I have\rnot killed him." \r\rWith this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume\rof his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. The strap\rof the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and Menelaus\rwould have dragged him off to his own great glory had not Jove\'s daughter\rVenus been quick to mark and to break the strap of oxhide, so that\rthe empty helmet came away in his hand. This he flung to his comrades\ramong the Achaeans, and was again springing upon Alexandrus to run\rhim through with a spear, but Venus snatched him up in a moment (as\ra god can do), hid him under a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him\rto his own bedchamber. \r\rThen she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with the\rTrojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old woman\rwho used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and\rof whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed\rrobe and said, "Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go to the\rhouse; he is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed\rin gorgeous apparel. No one would think he had just come from fighting,\rbut rather that he was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was\rsitting down." \r\rWith these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she marked\rthe beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and sparkling\reyes, she marvelled at her and said, "Goddess, why do you thus beguile\rme? Are you going to send me afield still further to some man whom\ryou have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus has just vanquished\rAlexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back with him. You are\rcome here to betray me. Go sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth\rbe goddess no longer; never let your feet carry you back to Olympus;\rworry about him and look after him till he make you his wife, or,\rfor the matter of that, his slave- but me? I shall not go; I can garnish\rhis bed no longer; I should be a by-word among all the women of Troy.\rBesides, I have trouble on my mind." \r\rVenus was very angry, and said, "Bold hussy, do not provoke me; if\ryou do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as I have\rloved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and Achaeans,\rand you shall come to a bad end." \r\rAt this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her and\rwent in silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the Trojan\rwomen. \r\rWhen they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set about\rtheir work, but Helen went into her own room, and the laughter-loving\rgoddess took a seat and set it for her facing Alexandrus. On this\rHelen, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down, and with eyes askance\rbegan to upbraid her husband. \r\r"So you are come from the fight," said she; "would that you had fallen\rrather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. You used\rto brag that you were a better man with hands and spear than Menelaus.\rgo, but I then, an challenge him again- but I should advise you not\rto do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet him in single combat,\ryou will soon all by his spear." \r\rAnd Paris answered, "Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches. This\rtime, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me; another\rtime I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that will stand by\rme. Come, let us lie down together and make friends. Never yet was\rI so passionately enamoured of you as at this moment- not even when\rI first carried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you-\rnot even when I had converse with you upon the couch of love in the\risland of Cranae was I so enthralled by desire of you as now." On\rthis he led her towards the bed, and his wife went with him.\r\rThus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus\rstrode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and no\rman, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If\rthey had seen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of\rthem hated him as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men,\rspoke, saying, "Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The victory\rhas been with Menelaus; therefore give back Helen with all her wealth,\rand pay such fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among them\rthat shall be born hereafter." \r\rThus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in applause.\r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK IV\r\rNow the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floor\rwhile Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and as\rthey pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon\rthe town of Troy. The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno, talking\rat her so as to provoke her. "Menelaus," said he, "has two good friends\ramong the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and Minerva of Alalcomene, but\rthey only sit still and look on, while Venus keeps ever by Alexandrus\'\rside to defend him in any danger; indeed she has just rescued him\rwhen he made sure that it was all over with him- for the victory really\rdid lie with Menelaus. We must consider what we shall do about all\rthis; shall we set them fighting anew or make peace between them?\rIf you will agree to this last Menelaus can take back Helen and the\rcity of Priam may remain still inhabited." \r\rMinerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by side\rhatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her father,\rfor she was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, but Juno\rcould not contain herself. "Dread son of Saturn," said she, "what,\rpray, is the meaning of all this? Is my trouble, then, to go for nothing,\rand the sweat that I have sweated, to say nothing of my horses, while\rgetting the people together against Priam and his children? Do as\ryou will, but we other gods shall not all of us approve your counsel."\r\rJove was angry and answered, "My dear, what harm have Priam and his\rsons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city of Ilius?\rWill nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eat Priam\rraw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have it your\rown way then; for I would not have this matter become a bone of contention\rbetween us. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, if ever\rI want to sack a city belonging to friends of yours, you must not\rtry to stop me; you will have to let me do it, for I am giving in\rto you sorely against my will. Of all inhabited cities under the sun\rand stars of heaven, there was none that I so much respected as Ilius\rwith Priam and his whole people. Equitable feasts were never wanting\rabout my altar, nor the savour of burning fat, which is honour due\rto ourselves." \r\r"My own three favourite cities," answered Juno, "are Argos, Sparta,\rand Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased with them. I\rshall not defend them and I shall not care. Even if I did, and tried\rto stay you, I should take nothing by it, for you are much stronger\rthan I am, but I will not have my own work wasted. I too am a god\rand of the same race with yourself. I am Saturn\'s eldest daughter,\rand am honourable not on this ground only, but also because I am your\rwife, and you are king over the gods. Let it be a case, then, of give-and-take\rbetween us, and the rest of the gods will follow our lead. Tell Minerva\rto go and take part in the fight at once, and let her contrive that\rthe Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the\rAchaeans." \r\rThe sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva, "Go\rat once into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that the Trojans\rshall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the Achaeans."\r\rThis was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted\rfrom the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky as some\rbrilliant meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent as a sign\rto mariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of light follows\rin its wake. The Trojans and Achaeans were struck with awe as they\rbeheld, and one would turn to his neighbour, saying, "Either we shall\ragain have war and din of combat, or Jove the lord of battle will\rnow make peace between us." \r\rThus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus, son\rof Antenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to find Pandarus,\rthe redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standing among the stalwart\rheroes who had followed him from the banks of the Aesopus, so she\rwent close up to him and said, "Brave son of Lycaon, will you do as\rI tell you? If you dare send an arrow at Menelaus you will win honour\rand thanks from all the Trojans, and especially from prince Alexandrus-\rhe would be the first to requite you very handsomely if he could see\rMenelaus mount his funeral pyre, slain by an arrow from your hand.\rTake your home aim then, and pray to Lycian Apollo, the famous archer;\rvow that when you get home to your strong city of Zelea you will offer\ra hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour." \r\rHis fool\'s heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case.\rThis bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he had killed\ras it was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen\ras the arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were sixteen palms\rlong, and a worker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them\rwell down, and giving them tips of gold. When Pandarus had strung\rhis bow he laid it carefully on the ground, and his brave followers\rheld their shields before him lest the Achaeans should set upon him\rbefore he had shot Menelaus. Then he opened the lid of his quiver\rand took out a winged arrow that had yet been shot, fraught with the\rpangs of death. He laid the arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian\rApollo, the famous archer, vowing that when he got home to his strong\rcity of Zelea he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his\rhonour. He laid the notch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and\rdrew both notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near\rthe bow; then when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly,\rand the bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew gladly\ron over the heads of the throng. \r\rBut the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove\'s daughter,\rdriver of the spoil, was the first to stand before thee and ward off\rthe piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as a mother whisks\ra fly from off her child when it is sleeping sweetly; she guided it\rto the part where the golden buckles of the belt that passed over\rhis double cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck the belt that\rwent tightly round him. It went right through this and through the\rcuirass of cunning workmanship; it also pierced the belt beneath it,\rwhich he wore next his skin to keep out darts or arrows; it was this\rthat served him in the best stead, nevertheless the arrow went through\rit and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood began flowing from\rthe wound. \r\rAs when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to a piece\rof ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is to be laid\rup in a treasure house- many a knight is fain to bear it, but the\rking keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and driver may be\rproud- even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs and your legs\rdown to your fair ancles stained with blood. \r\rWhen King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was afraid,\rand so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the barbs of the\rarrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaft were still\routside the wound. Then he took heart, but Agamemnon heaved a deep\rsigh as he held Menelaus\'s hand in his own, and his comrades made\rmoan in concert. "Dear brother, "he cried, "I have been the death\rof you in pledging this covenant and letting you come forward as our\rchampion. The Trojans have trampled on their oaths and have wounded\ryou; nevertheless the oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offerings\rand the right hands of fellowship in which have put our trust shall\rnot be vain. If he that rules Olympus fulfil it not here and now,\rhe. will yet fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their\rlives and with their wives and children. The day will surely come\rwhen mighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam\'s people,\rwhen the son of Saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them\rwith his awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery. This\rshall surely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your\rlot now to die? I should return to Argos as a by-word, for the Achaeans\rwill at once go home. We shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory\rof still keeping Helen, and the earth will rot your bones as you lie\rhere at Troy with your purpose not fulfilled. Then shall some braggart\rTrojan leap upon your tomb and say, \'Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak\rhis vengeance; he brought his army in vain; he is gone home to his\rown land with empty ships, and has left Menelaus behind him.\' Thus\rwill one of them say, and may the earth then swallow me."\r\rBut Menelaus reassured him and said, "Take heart, and do not alarm\rthe people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outer\rbelt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass\rand the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths made me." \r\rAnd Agamemnon answered, "I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be even\rso, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon it\rto relieve your pain." \r\rHe then said to Talthybius, "Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to the\rgreat physician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus immediately.\rSome Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our\rdismay, and to his own great glory." \r\rTalthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to find\rMachaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriors who had\rfollowed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and said, "Son\rof Aesculapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come and see Menelaus\rimmediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an\rarrow to our dismay and to his own great glory." \r\rThus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passed through\rthe spreading host of the Achaeans and went on till they came to the\rplace where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying with the chieftains\rgathered in a circle round him. Machaon passed into the middle of\rthe ring and at once drew the arrow from the belt, bending its barbs\rback through the force with which he pulled it out. He undid the burnished\rbelt, and beneath this the cuirass and the belt of mail which the\rbronze-smiths had made; then, when he had seen the wound, he wiped\raway the blood and applied some soothing drugs which Chiron had given\rto Aesculapius out of the good will he bore him. \r\rWhile they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came forward\ragainst them, for they had put on their armour, and now renewed the\rfight. \r\rYou would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and unwilling\rto fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his chariot rich\rwith bronze and his panting steeds in charge of Eurymedon, son of\rPtolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readiness\ragainst the time his limbs should weary of going about and giving\rorders to so many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he saw\rmen hasting to the front he stood by them and cheered them on. "Argives,"\rsaid he, "slacken not one whit in your onset; father Jove will be\rno helper of liars; the Trojans have been the first to break their\roaths and to attack us; therefore they shall be devoured of vultures;\rwe shall take their city and carry off their wives and children in\rour ships." \r\rBut he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined\rto fight. "Argives," he cried, "cowardly miserable creatures, have\ryou no shame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can\rno longer scud over the plain, huddle together, but show no fight?\rYou are as dazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait till the Trojans\rreach the sterns of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see, whether\rthe son of Saturn will hold his hand over you to protect you?"\r\rThus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing through\rthe crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming round Idomeneus,\rwho was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while Meriones was bringing\rup the battalions that were in the rear. Agamemnon was glad when he\rsaw him, and spoke him fairly. "Idomeneus," said he, "I treat you\rwith greater distinction than I do any others of the Achaeans, whether\rin war or in other things, or at table. When the princes are mixing\rmy choicest wines in the mixing-bowls, they have each of them a fixed\rallowance, but your cup is kept always full like my own, that you\rmay drink whenever you are minded. Go, therefore, into battle, and\rshow yourself the man you have been always proud to be."\r\rIdomeneus answered, "I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised you\rfrom the first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that we may\rjoin battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon their covenants.\rDeath and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they have been the first\rto break their oaths and to attack us." \r\rThe son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the two\rAjaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot-soldiers. As when a goat-herd\rfrom some high post watches a storm drive over the deep before the\rwest wind- black as pitch is the offing and a mighty whirlwind draws\rtowards him, so that he is afraid and drives his flock into a cave-\reven thus did the ranks of stalwart youths move in a dark mass to\rbattle under the Ajaxes, horrid with shield and spear. Glad was King\rAgamemnon when he saw them. "No need," he cried, "to give orders to\rsuch leaders of the Argives as you are, for of your own selves you\rspur your men on to fight with might and main. Would, by father Jove,\rMinerva, and Apollo that all were so minded as you are, for the city\rof Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack\rit." \r\rWith this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speaker\rof the Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging them on, in\rcompany with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and Bias shepherd\rof his people. He placed his knights with their chariots and horses\rin the front rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom\rhe could trust, were in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle,\rthat they might fight whether they would or no. He gave his orders\rto the knights first, bidding them hold their horses well in hand,\rso as to avoid confusion. "Let no man," he said, "relying on his strength\ror horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly with the\rTrojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your attack;\rbut let each when he meets an enemy\'s chariot throw his spear from\rhis own; this be much the best; this is how the men of old took towns\rand strongholds; in this wise were they minded." \r\rThus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight,\rand King Agamemnon was glad. "I wish," he said to him, that your limbs\rwere as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but\rage, the common enemy of mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would\rthat it had fallen upon some other, and that you were still young."\r\rAnd Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, "Son of Atreus, I too would\rgladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; but the gods\rwill not give us everything at one and the same time. I was then young,\rand now I am old; still I can go with my knights and give them that\rcounsel which old men have a right to give. The wielding of the spear\rI leave to those who are younger and stronger than myself."\r\rAgamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus,\rson of Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the Athenians\rloud of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunning Ulysses, with\rhis sturdy Cephallenians round him; they had not yet heard the battle-cry,\rfor the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans had only just begun to move,\rso they were standing still, waiting for some other columns of the\rAchaeans to attack the Trojans and begin the fighting. When he saw\rthis Agamemnon rebuked them and said, "Son of Peteos, and you other,\rsteeped in cunning, heart of guile, why stand you here cowering and\rwaiting on others? You two should be of all men foremost when there\ris hard fighting to be done, for you are ever foremost to accept my\rinvitation when we councillors of the Achaeans are holding feast.\rYou are glad enough then to take your fill of roast meats and to drink\rwine as long as you please, whereas now you would not care though\ryou saw ten columns of Achaeans engage the enemy in front of you."\r\rUlysses glared at him and answered, "Son of Atreus, what are you talking\rabout? How can you say that we are slack? When the Achaeans are in\rfull fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if you care to do so,\rthat the father of Telemachus will join battle with the foremost of\rthem. You are talking idly." \r\rWhen Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly at\rhim and withdrew his words. "Ulysses," said he, "noble son of Laertes,\rexcellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor orders\rto give you, for I know your heart is right, and that you and I are\rof a mind. Enough; I will make you amends for what I have said, and\rif any ill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing."\r\rHe then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son\rof Tydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, with\rSthenelus the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began to upbraid\rhim. "Son of Tydeus," he said, "why stand you cowering here upon the\rbrink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever ahead of\rhis men when leading them on against the foe- so, at least, say they\rthat saw him in battle, for I never set eyes upon him myself. They\rsay that there was no man like him. He came once to Mycenae, not as\ran enemy but as a guest, in company with Polynices to recruit his\rforces, for they were levying war against the strong city of Thebes,\rand prayed our people for a body of picked men to help them. The men\rof Mycenae were willing to let them have one, but Jove dissuaded them\rby showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus, therefore, and Polynices\rwent their way. When they had got as far the deep-meadowed and rush-grown\rbanks of the Aesopus, the Achaeans sent Tydeus as their envoy, and\rhe found the Cadmeans gathered in great numbers to a banquet in the\rhouse of Eteocles. Stranger though he was, he knew no fear on finding\rhimself single-handed among so many, but challenged them to contests\rof all kinds, and in each one of them was at once victorious, so mightily\rdid Minerva help him. The Cadmeans were incensed at his success, and\rset a force of fifty youths with two captains- the godlike hero Maeon,\rson of Haemon, and Polyphontes, son of Autophonus- at their head,\rto lie in wait for him on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every\rman of them, save only Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven\'s\romens. Such was Tydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but\rhe cannot fight as his father did." \r\rDiomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon;\rbut the son of Capaneus took up his words and said, "Son of Atreus,\rtell no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. We boast ourselves\ras even better men than our fathers; we took seven-gated Thebes, though\rthe wall was stronger and our men were fewer in number, for we trusted\rin the omens of the gods and in the help of Jove, whereas they perished\rthrough their own sheer folly; hold not, then, our fathers in like\rhonour with us." \r\rDiomed looked sternly at him and said, "Hold your peace, my friend,\ras I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge the Achaeans\rforward, for the glory will be his if we take the city, and his the\rshame if we are vanquished. Therefore let us acquit ourselves with\rvalour." \r\rAs he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so fiercely\rabout his body that even a brave man might well have been scared to\rhear it. \r\rAs when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west\rwind has lashed it into fury- it has reared its head afar and now\rcomes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high over\rthe jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions- even so\rdid the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastly to battle.\rThe chiefs gave orders each to his own people, but the men said never\ra word; no man would think it, for huge as the host was, it seemed\ras though there was not a tongue among them, so silent were they in\rtheir obedience; and as they marched the armour about their bodies\rglistened in the sun. But the clamour of the Trojan ranks was as that\rof many thousand ewes that stand waiting to be milked in the yards\rof some rich flockmaster, and bleat incessantly in answer to the bleating\rof their lambs; for they had not one speech nor language, but their\rtongues were diverse, and they came from many different places. These\rwere inspired of Mars, but the others by Minerva- and with them came\rPanic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never tires, sister and friend\rof murderous Mars, who, from being at first but low in stature, grows\rtill she uprears her head to heaven, though her feet are still on\rearth. She it was that went about among them and flung down discord\rto the waxing of sorrow with even hand between them. \r\rWhen they were got together in one place shield clashed with shield\rand spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossed shields beat\rone upon another, and there was a tramp as of a great multitude- death-cry\rand shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with\rblood. As torrents swollen with rain course madly down their deep\rchannels till the angry floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd\rthe hillside hears their roaring from afar- even such was the toil\rand uproar of the hosts as they joined in battle. \r\rFirst Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus,\rson of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at the\rprojecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; the\rpoint of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes; headlong\ras a tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as he dropped\rKing Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and captain of the proud Abantes\rbegan dragging him out of reach of the darts that were falling around\rhim, in haste to strip him of his armour. But his purpose was not\rfor long; Agenor saw him haling the body away, and smote him in the\rside with his bronze-shod spear- for as he stooped his side was left\runprotected by his shield- and thus he perished. Then the fight between\rTrojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew upon\reach other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other.\r\rForthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius, son\rof Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the Simois, as\rshe was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been with her parents\rto see their flocks. Therefore he was named Simoeisius, but he did\rnot live to pay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut off untimely\rby the spear of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breast by the right\rnipple as he was coming on among the foremost fighters; the spear\rwent right through his shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has\rgrown straight and tall in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick\rwith branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that\rhe may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and\rit lies seasoning by the waterside. In such wise did Ajax fell to\rearth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon Antiphus of the gleaming\rcorslet, son of Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax from amid the crowd\rand missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade of Ulysses, in\rthe groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisius over to the other\rside; so he fell upon the body and loosed his hold upon it. Ulysses\rwas furious when he saw Leucus slain, and strode in full armour through\rthe front ranks till he was quite close; then he glared round about\rhim and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as he did so. His dart\rwas not sped in vain, for it struck Democoon, the bastard son of Priam,\rwho had come to him from Abydos, where he had charge of his father\'s\rmares. Ulysses, infuriated by the death of his comrade, hit him with\rhis spear on one temple, and the bronze point came through on the\rother side of his forehead. Thereon darkness veiled his eyes, and\rhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\rHector, and they that were in front, then gave round while the Argives\rraised a shout and drew off the dead, pressing further forward as\rthey did so. But Apollo looked down from Pergamus and called aloud\rto the Trojans, for he was displeased. "Trojans," he cried, "rush\ron the foe, and do not let yourselves be thus beaten by the Argives.\rTheir skins are not stone nor iron that when hit them you do them\rno harm. Moreover, Achilles, the son of lovely Thetis, is not fighting,\rbut is nursing his anger at the ships." \r\rThus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while Jove\'s\rredoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among the host of\rthe Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld them slackening.\r\rThen fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struck by\ra jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled it\rwas Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who had come\rfrom Aenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed by the pitiless\rstone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in his death throes\rstretched out his hands towards his comrades. But Peirous, who had\rwounded him, sprang on him and thrust a spear into his belly, so that\rhis bowels came gushing out upon the ground, and darkness veiled his\reyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas of Aetolia struck him in the\rchest near the nipple, and the point fixed itself in his lungs. Thoas\rcame close up to him, pulled the spear out of his chest, and then\rdrawing his sword, smote him in the middle of the belly so that he\rdied; but he did not strip him of his armour, for his Thracian comrades,\rmen who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of their heads, stood\rround the body and kept him off with their long spears for all his\rgreat stature and valour; so he was driven back. Thus the two corpses\rlay stretched on earth near to one another, the one captain of the\rThracians and the other of the Epeans; and many another fell round\rthem. \r\rAnd now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could have\rgone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minerva leading\rhim by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears and arrows.\rFor many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched side by side\rface downwards upon the earth. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK V\r\rThen Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of Tydeus,\rthat he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himself with\rglory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet\rlike the star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath\rin the waters of Oceanus- even such a fire did she kindle upon his\rhead and shoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly\rof the fight. \r\rNow there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,\rpriest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus\rand Idaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two\rcame forward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he\rbeing on foot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were\rclose up to one another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went\rover Diomed\'s left shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw,\rand his spear sped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near\rthe nipple, and he fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride\rhis brother\'s body, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight,\ror he would have shared his brother\'s fate; whereon Vulcan saved him\rby wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his old father might\rnot be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son of Tydeus drove\roff with the horses, and bade his followers take them to the ships.\rThe Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of Dares, one of\rthem in fright and the other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva, therefore,\rtook Mars by the hand and said, "Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained\rstormer of cities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to\rfight it out, and see to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the\rvictory? Let us go away, and thus avoid his anger." \r\rSo saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon\rthe steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the\rTrojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First\rKing Agamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his\rchariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,\rjust as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the shoulders\rand went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round\rhim as he fell heavily to the ground. \r\rThen Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had come\rfrom Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as\rhe was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded\rhim as he fell heavily from the car. \r\rThe squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus,\rson of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a mighty huntsman\rand keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill\revery kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but\rneither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for\rthe spear of Menelaus struck him in the back as he was flying; it\rstruck him between the shoulders and went right through his chest,\rso that he fell headlong and his armour rang rattling round him.\r\rMeriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son\rof Hermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning workmanship,\rfor Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that made the ships\rfor Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all mischief, and brought\revil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus himself; for he heeded\rnot the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him as he was flying,\rand struck him on the right buttock. The point of the spear went through\rthe bone into the bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud\rand fell forward on his knees. \r\rMeges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was\ra bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children,\rfor the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up\rto him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under\rhis tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell\rdead in the dust. \r\rAnd Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble Dolopion,\rwho had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was honoured\ramong the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him chase\ras he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the arm,\rand lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to the\rground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can withstand,\rcame over his eyes. \r\rThus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of\rTydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or\rthe Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that\rhas burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful\rvineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven,\rbut in a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste\rthat many a strong man hand has reclaimed- even so were the dense\rphalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and\rmany though they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.\r\rNow when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving\rthe Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front\rpart of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through\rthe metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with\rblood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph, "Knights Trojans,\rcome on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold\rout much longer if King Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from\rLycia hither." \r\rThus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew\rand made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.\r"Dear son of Capaneus," said he, "come down from your chariot, and\rdraw the arrow out of my shoulder." \r\rSthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound,\rwhereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been\rmade in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, "Hear me, daughter\rof aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well\rand stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant\rme to come within a spear\'s throw of that man and kill him. He has\rbeen too quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting that\rI shall not see the light of the sun much longer." \r\rThus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs supple\rand quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to him\rand said, "Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I\rhave set in your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus.\rMoreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know\rgods and men apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers\ryou battle, do not fight him; but should Jove\'s daughter Venus come,\rstrike her with your spear and wound her." \r\rWhen she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus again\rtook his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierce\reven than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain\rshepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the\rwall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has roused\rthe brute to fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter\runder cover of the buildings, while the sheep, panic-stricken on being\rdeserted, are smothered in heaps one on top of the other, and the\rangry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall. Even thus did Diomed\rgo furiously about among the Trojans. \r\rHe killed Astynous, and shepherd of his people, the one with a thrust\rof his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with a\rsword- cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his\rneck and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas\rand Polyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never\rcame back for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed\rmade an end of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the\rtwo sons of Phaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now\rworn out with age, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions.\rBut Diomed took both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly,\rfor he nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen\rdivided his wealth among themselves. \r\rThen he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as they\rwere both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on\rthe neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice.\rFor all their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot\rand stripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their horses\rto his comrades to take them back to the ships. \r\rWhen Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went through\rthe fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandarus.\rWhen he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, "Pandarus, where\ris now your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer,\rin respect of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in\rLycia that can beat you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an\rarrow at this fellow who is going so masterfully about, and has done\rsuch deadly work among the Trojans. He has killed many a brave man-\runless indeed he is some god who is angry with the Trojans about their\rsacrifices, and and has set his hand against them in his displeasure."\r\rAnd the son of Lycaon answered, "Aeneas, I take him for none other\rthan the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his\rhelmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but\rif he is the man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without\rheaven\'s help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud\rof darkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I\rhave taken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my\rarrow went through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure\rI should send him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that I\rhave not killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me. Moreover\rI have neither horse nor chariot. In my father\'s stables there are\releven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with\rcloths spread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of\rhorses, champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again\rand again when I was at home and on the point of starting, to take\rchariots and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle,\rbut I would not listen to him; it would have been much better if I\rhad done so, but I was thinking about the horses, which had been used\rto eat their fill, and I was afraid that in such a great gathering\rof men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot\rto Ilius armed only with my bow and arrows. These it seems, are of\rno use, for I have already hit two chieftains, the sons of Atreus\rand of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, I have only\rmade them still more furious. I did ill to take my bow down from its\rpeg on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilius in Hector\'s service,\rand if ever I get home again to set eyes on my native place, my wife,\rand the greatness of my house, may some one cut my head off then and\rthere if I do not break the bow and set it on a hot fire- such pranks\ras it plays me." \r\rAeneas answered, "Say no more. Things will not mend till we two go\ragainst this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial\rof arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros\rcan speed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight.\rIf Jove again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry\rus safely back to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins\rwhile I stand upon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man\'s\ronset while I look after the horses." \r\r"Aeneas." replied the son of Lycaon, "take the reins and drive; if\rwe have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better\rfor their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they\rexpect it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the\rfight. The son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses.\rTherefore drive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my\rspear." \r\rThey then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son\rof Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to\rDiomed, "Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two\rheroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful\rarcher, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is Anchises,\rwhile his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us retreat. Do\rnot, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may get killed."\r\rDiomed looked angrily at him and answered: "Talk not of flight, for\rI shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither flight\rnor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount,\rbut will go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid\rof no man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall\rnot take both back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your\rheart- if Minerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both,\rstay your horses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot;\rthen be sure you spring Aeneas\' horses and drive them from the Trojan\rto the Achaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove gave to\rTros in payment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live\rand move under the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by putting his\rmares to them without Laomedon\'s knowledge, and they bore him six\rfoals. Four are still in his stables, but he gave the other two to\rAeneas. We shall win great glory if we can take them." \r\rThus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up\rto them, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. "Great and mighty son,"\rsaid he, "of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will\rnow try with my spear." \r\rHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck\rthe shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed\ron till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted\rout and said, "You are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand\rout for long, and the glory of the fight is mine." \r\rBut Diomed all undismayed made answer, "You have missed, not hit,\rand before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you\rshall glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood." \r\rWith this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus\'s\rnose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the\rbronze point cut through the root of his to tongue, coming out under\rhis chin, and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he\rfell heavily to the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and\rhe was reft of life and strength. \r\rAeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing\rlest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion\rin the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before him and\ra cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should\rdare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so\rhuge and great that as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless\rhe bore it aloft with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas\ron the groin where the hip turns in the joint that is called the "cup-bone."\rThe stone crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its\rjagged edges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees,\rand propped himself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness\rof night fell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of men, would have\rperished then and there, had not his mother, Jove\'s daughter Venus,\rwho had conceived him by Anchises when he was herding cattle, been\rquick to mark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her\rdear son. She protected him by covering him with a fold of her own\rfair garment, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast\rand kill him. \r\rThus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the son\rof Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had given\rhim. He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding\rthe reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas\'s\rhorses and drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he\rhad so done he gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom\rhe valued above all others as the one who was most like-minded with\rhimself, to take them on to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot,\rseized the reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of\rTydeus. \r\rNow the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear\rin hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses\rthat can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster\rof cities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he\rflew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand.\rThe point tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven\rfor her, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her\rhand, so that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the veins\rof the blessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods do\rnot eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours,\rand are immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but\rPhoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness,\rlest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him;\rand Diomed shouted out as he left her, "Daughter of Jove, leave war\rand battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women?\rIf you meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder\rat the very name of war." \r\rThe goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as the\rwind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all\rbesmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,\rwith his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon\rshe fell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her\rhave his horses. "Dear brother," she cried, "save me, and give me\ryour horses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly\rwounded by a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with\rfather Jove." \r\rThus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She mounted\rthe chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her and\rtook the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew\rforward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where\rthe gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them\rfrom the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus\rflung herself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms\rabout her and caressed her, saying, "Which of the heavenly beings\rhas been treating you in this way, as though you had been doing something\rwrong in the face of day?" \r\rAnd laughter-loving Venus answered, "Proud Diomed, the son of Tydeus,\rwounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I love best\rof all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between\rTrojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with\rthe immortals." \r\r"Bear it, my child," replied Dione, "and make the best of it. We dwellers\rin Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, and we lay\rmuch suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus and Ephialtes,\rchildren of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay thirteen\rmonths imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would have then perished\rhad not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, told Mercury,\rwho stole him away when he was already well-nigh worn out by the severity\rof his bondage. Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son of Amphitryon\rwounded her on the right breast with a three-barbed arrow, and nothing\rcould assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hades, when this same man,\rthe son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit him with an arrow even at the gates\rof hell, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went to the house of Jove\ron great Olympus, angry and full of pain; and the arrow in his brawny\rshoulder caused him great anguish till Paeeon healed him by spreading\rsoothing herbs on the wound, for Hades was not of mortal mould. Daring,\rhead-strong, evildoer who recked not of his sin in shooting the gods\rthat dwell in Olympus. And now Minerva has egged this son of Tydeus\ron against yourself, fool that he is for not reflecting that no man\rwho fights with gods will live long or hear his children prattling\rabout his knees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of\rTydeus see that he does not have to fight with one who is stronger\rthan you are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of Adrestus,\rrouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of her wedded\rlord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans." \r\rSo saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with\rboth hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But\rMinerva and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with their\rmocking talk, and Minerva was first to speak. "Father Jove," said\rshe, "do not be angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must have been\rpersuading some one of the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of\rwhom she is so very fond, and while caressing one or other of them\rshe must have torn her delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman\'s\rbrooch." \r\rThe sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his side.\r"My child," said he, "it has not been given you to be a warrior. Attend,\rhenceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and leave all\rthis fighting to Mars and to Minerva." \r\rThus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he knew\rhim to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear the\rmighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his\rarmour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay him,\rand thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he was coming\ron for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo shouted to\rhim with an awful voice and said, "Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw\roff; think not to match yourself against gods, for men that walk the\rearth cannot hold their own with the immortals." \r\rThe son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the anger\rof the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set him\rin sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty\rsanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to behold,\rwhile Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness\rof Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans\rhacked at the bucklers about one another\'s breasts, hewing each other\'s\rround shields and light hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo\rsaid to Mars, "Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities,\rcan you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight\reven with father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first went\rup to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and\rafterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a god."\r\rHe then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars\rwent about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the\rlikeness of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. "Sons of Priam,"\rsaid he, "how long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by\rthe Achaeans? Would you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas\rthe son of Anchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour\ras Hector himself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from\rthe stress of the fight." \r\rWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then Sarpedon\rrebuked Hector very sternly. "Hector," said he, "where is your prowess\rnow? You used to say that though you had neither people nor allies\ryou could hold the town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law.\rI see not one of them here; they cower as hounds before a lion; it\ris we, your allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have come\rfrom afar, even from Lycia and the banks of the river Xanthus, where\rI have left my wife, my infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever\ris needy; nevertheless, I head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground\ragainst any who would fight me though I have nothing here for the\rAchaeans to plunder, while you look on, without even bidding your\rmen stand firm in defence of their wives. See that you fall not into\rthe hands of your foes as men caught in the meshes of a net, and they\rsack your fair city forthwith. Keep this before your mind night and\rday, and beseech the captains of your allies to hold on without flinching,\rand thus put away their reproaches from you." \r\rSo spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang from\rhis chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among the host\rbrandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising\rthe terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the\rAchaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven\rback. As the breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor,\rwhen men are winnowing- while yellow Ceres blows with the wind to\rsift the chaff from the grain, and the chaff- heaps grow whiter and\rwhiter- even so did the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses\'\rhoofs raised to the firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them\rback to battle, and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce\rMars, to help the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and\rwent about everywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told\rhim that when he saw Pallas, Minerva leave the fray he was to put\rcourage into the hearts of the Trojans- for it was she who was helping\rthe Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary,\rand filled his heart with valour, whereon he took his place among\rhis comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of\ra good courage; but they could not ask him how it had all happened,\rfor they were too busy with the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife,\rwho raged insatiably in their midst. \r\rThe two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless\rof the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds\rwhich the son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there\ris no air and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds\rwhose shrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions- even so\rdid the Danaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The\rson of Atreus went about among them and exhorted them. "My friends,"\rsaid he, "quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one\ranother\'s eyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour\rmore often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither life\rnor name." \r\rAs he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the\rfront rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the\rTrojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was\rever quick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King\rAgamemnon struck his shield and went right through it, for the shield\rstayed it not. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his\rbelly, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to\rthe ground. \r\rThen Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and Orsilochus.\rTheir father was a rich man who lived in the strong city of Phere\rand was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad stream flows\rthrough the land of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilochus, who ruled\rover much people and was father to Diocles, who in his turn begat\rtwin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of\rwar. These, when they grew up, went to Ilius with the Argive fleet\rin the cause of Menelaus and Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and there they\rboth of them fell. As two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths\rof some mountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep\rand cattle till they get killed by the hand of man, so were these\rtwo vanquished by Aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to the ground.\r\rBrave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the\rfront, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars\regged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by Aeneas;\rbut Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward, fearing\rthat the king might come to harm and thus bring all their labour to\rnothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were setting their hands\rand spears against one another eager to do battle, Antilochus placed\rhimself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold though he was, drew\rback on seeing the two heroes side by side in front of him, so they\rdrew the bodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks of the Achaeans\rand committed the two poor fellows into the hands of their comrades.\rThey then turned back and fought in the front ranks. \r\rThey killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian warriors.\rMenelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on his chariot,\rwhile Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the son of Atymnius,\rwho was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with a stone upon\rthe elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell from his\rhands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck him\ron the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the\rchariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and\rshoulders buried deep in the dust- for he had fallen on sandy soil\rtill his horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus\rlashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.\r\rBut Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry\rrushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.\rMars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil\rof battle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now\rin front of Hector and now behind him. \r\rDiomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide\rplain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river\rrolling swiftly to the sea- he sees its boiling waters and starts\rback in fear- even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said\rto his men, "My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the\rspear so well? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now\rMars is with him in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore\rtowards the Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not fight\rwith gods." \r\rAs he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men,\rboth in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in\rwar. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close\rup and hurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man\rof great wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land,\rbut his lot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons.\rAjax struck him in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his\rbelly, and he fell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him\rto strip him of his armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him,\rmany of which fell upon his shield. He planted his heel upon the body\rand drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him\rthat he could not strip the goodly armour from his shoulders. The\rTrojan chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him with\rtheir spears, so that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant\rthough he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten back.\r\rThus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong\rhand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both\rbrave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and\rgrandson of great Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke\rfirst. "Sarpedon," said he, "councillor of the Lycians, why should\ryou come skulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call\ryou son of aegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were\rof old his children. Far other was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted\rfather, who came here for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had\rsix ships only, and few men to follow him, sacked the city of Ilius\rand made a wilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your\rpeople are falling from you. For all your strength, and all your coming\rfrom Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates\rof Hades vanquished by my hand." \r\rAnd Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, "Tlepolemus, your\rfather overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon\'s folly in refusing payment\rto one who had served him well. He would not give your father the\rhorses which he had come so far to fetch. As for yourself, you shall\rmeet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and your\rsoul to Hades of the noble steeds." \r\rThus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw\rat the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his\rthroat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell\rupon his eyes. Tlepolemus\'s spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh\rwith such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone,\rbut his father as yet warded off destruction from him. \r\rHis comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the\rweight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in\rsuch haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing\rthe spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile\rthe Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon Ulysses was\rmoved to pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted\rwhether to pursue the son of Jove, or to make slaughter of the Lycian\rrank and file; it was not decreed, however, that he should slay the\rson of Jove; Minerva, therefore, turned him against the main body\rof the Lycians. He killed Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius, Alcandrus,\rHalius, Noemon, and Prytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not\rgreat Hector marked him, and sped to the front of the fight clad in\rhis suit of mail, filling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad\rwhen he saw him coming, and besought him, saying, "Son of Priam, let\rme not he here to fall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me, and\rsince I may not return home to gladden the hearts of my wife and of\rmy infant son, let me die within the walls of your city."\r\rHector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon\rthe Achaeans and. kill many among them. His comrades then bore Sarpedon\raway and laid him beneath Jove\'s spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his\rfriend and comrade drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon fainted\rand a mist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself again,\rfor the breath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new\rlife, and brought him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen.\r\rMeanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by Mars\rand Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that Mars\rwas with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned\rtowards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by\rMars and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes the renowned\rcharioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son\rof Oenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who was possessed\rof great wealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians\rwho lived near him, owners of a fertile country. \r\rNow when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said to\rMinerva, "Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the promise\rwe made Menelaus that he should not return till he had sacked the\rcity of Ilius will be of none effect if we let Mars rage thus furiously.\rLet us go into the fray at once." \r\rMinerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter\rof great Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe\rwith all speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were\ron either side of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were\rof gold, imperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze,\rwondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round\rthe axle upon either side. The car itself was made with plaited bands\rof gold and silver, and it had a double top-rail running all round\rit. From the body of the car there went a pole of silver, on to the\rend of which she bound the golden yoke, with the bands of gold that\rwere to go under the necks of the horses Then Juno put her steeds\runder the yoke, eager for battle and the war-cry. \r\rMeanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with\rher own hands, on to her father\'s threshold, and donned the shirt\rof Jove, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis\rabout. her shoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and\ron it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold;\rmoreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon,, grim and\rawful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she set\rher helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to a peak both in\rfront and behind- decked with the emblems of a hundred cities; then\rshe stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stout\rand sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes who\rhave displeased her. Juno lashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven\rbellowed as they flew open of their own accord -gates over which the\rflours preside, in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open\rthe dense cloud that hides them, or to close it. Through these the\rgoddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found the son of Saturn\rsitting all alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus. There Juno stayed\rher horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn, lord of all. "Father\rJove," said she, "are you not angry with Mars for these high doings?\rhow great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he has destroyed to my\rgreat grief, and without either right or reason, while the Cyprian\rand Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease and setting this unrighteous\rmadman on to do further mischief. I hope, Father Jove, that you will\rnot be angry if I hit Mars hard, and chase him out of the battle."\r\rAnd Jove answered, "Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him more\roften than any one else does." \r\rJuno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward\rnothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can see\rwhen he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can the\rloud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they\rreached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simois and\rScamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from the chariot.\rShe hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosia spring up\rfor them to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves\rin their eagerness to help the Argives. When they came to the part\rwhere the bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty Diomed,\rfighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance,\rthere Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voiced\rStentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together. "Argives,"\rshe cried; "shame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only;\ras long as Achilles was fighting, fi his spear was so deadly that\rthe Trojans dared not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates,\rbut now they sally far from the city and fight even at your ships."\r\rWith these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva\rsprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his chariot\rand horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For the\rsweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield irritated\rthe hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up the strap\rto wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke of his\rhorses and said, "The son of Tydeus is not such another as his father.\rTydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly into\rthe fray even when I told him not to do so. When he went all unattended\ras envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I bade him feast\rin their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit which was\rever present with him, he challenged the youth of the Cadmeans, and\rat once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightily did I help\rhim. I stand by you too to protect you, and I bid you be instant in\rfighting the Trojans; but either you are tired out, or you are afraid\rand out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no true son\rof Tydeus the son of Oeneus." \r\rDiomed answered, "I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove,\rand will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of heart,\rnor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your own instructions;\ryou told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but if Jove\'s daughter\rVenus came into battle I was to wound her with my spear. Therefore\rI am retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather in this place,\rfor I know that Mars is now lording it in the field." \r\r"Diomed, son of Tydeus," replied Minerva, "man after my own heart,\rfear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will befriend\ryou. Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close combat; fear\rnot this raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then\ron the other. But now he was holding talk with Juno and myself, saying\rhe would help the Argives and attack the Trojans; nevertheless he\ris with the Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives." \r\rWith this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the chariot\ron to the ground. In a second he was on the ground, whereupon the\rgoddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side of Diomed.\rThe oaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess\rand the hero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins, and drove straight\rat Mars. He was in the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesius\rand bravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Mars was stripping him of his\rarmour, and Minerva donned the helmet of Hades, that he might not\rsee her; when, therefore, he saw Diomed, he made straight for him\rand let Periphas lie where he had fallen. As soon as they were at\rclose quarters he let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and\ryoke, thinking to take Diomed\'s life, but Minerva caught the spear\rin her hand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed then\rthrew, and Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars\'s stomach\rwhere his under-girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him, tearing\rhis fair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars roared as\rloudly as nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the\rAchaeans and Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry\rhe raised. \r\rAs a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even\rso did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens.\rWith all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great\rpain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the immortal\rblood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying,\r"Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods are continually\rsuffering in the most cruel manner at one another\'s hands while helping\rmortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten that mad\rtermagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage of some\rkind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her you neither\rscold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent creature\ris your daughter. See how she has been inciting proud Diomed to vent\rhis rage on the immortal gods. First he went up to the Cyprian and\rwounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me\rtoo as though he were a god. Had I not run for it I must either have\rlain there for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpes, or\rhave been eaten alive with spears till I had no more strength left\rin me." \r\rJove looked angrily at him and said, "Do not come whining here, Sir\rFacing-bothways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus, for\ryou are ever fighting and making mischief. You have the intolerable\rand stubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can do to manage\rher, and it is her doing that you are now in this plight: still, I\rcannot let you remain longer in such great pain; you are my own off-spring,\rand it was by me that your mother conceived you; if, however, you\rhad been the son of any other god, you are so destructive that by\rthis time you should have been lying lower than the Titans."\r\rHe then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing herbs\rupon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As the\rjuice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment though\rit is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars. Then\rHebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his\rseat by his father Jove all glorious to behold. \r\rBut Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put\ra stop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house\rof Jove. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK VI\r\rThe fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it\rwould, and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the plain\ras they aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another between the\rstreams of Simois and Xanthus. \r\rFirst, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, broke\ra phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comrades\rby killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians,\rbeing both brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projecting\rpeak of his helmet: its bronze point then went through his forehead\rinto the brain, and darkness veiled his eyes. \r\rThen Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived\rin the strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had\ra house by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeit\rnot one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomed\rkilled both him and his squire Calesius, who was then his charioteer-\rso the pair passed beneath the earth. \r\rEuryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit of\rAesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to noble\rBucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a bastard.\rWhile tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and she conceived\rtwin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew, and he stripped the\rarmour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then killed Astyalus, Ulysses\rPidytes of Percote, and Teucer Aretaon. Ablerus fell by the spear\rof Nestor\'s son Antilochus, and Agamemnon, king of men, killed Elatus\rwho dwelt in Pedasus by the banks of the river Satnioeis. Leitus killed\rPhylacus as he was flying, and Eurypylus slew Melanthus.\r\rThen Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for his horses\rran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over the plain,\rand broke the pole from the car; they went on towards the city along\rwith the others in full flight, but Adrestus rolled out, and fell\rin the dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot; Menelaus\rcame up to him spear in hand, but Adrestus caught him by the knees\rbegging for his life. "Take me alive," he cried, "son of Atreus, and\ryou shall have a full ransom for me: my father is rich and has much\rtreasure of gold, bronze, and wrought iron laid by in his house. From\rthis store he will give you a large ransom should he hear of my being\ralive and at the ships of the Achaeans." \r\rThus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him to\ra squire to take to the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon came\rrunning up to him and rebuked him. "My good Menelaus," said he, "this\ris no time for giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared so well\rat the hands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a single one of them-\rnot even the child unborn and in its mother\'s womb; let not a man\rof them be left alive, but let all in Ilius perish, unheeded and forgotten."\r\rThus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his words\rwere just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him, whereon\rKing Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then the son\rof Atreus planted his foot upon his breast to draw his spear from\rthe body. \r\rMeanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, "My friends, Danaan\rwarriors, servants of Mars, let no man lag that he may spoil the dead,\rand bring back much booty to the ships. Let us kill as many as we\rcan; the bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them\rlater at your leisure." \r\rWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now the\rTrojans would have been routed and driven back into Ilius, had not\rPriam\'s son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and Aeneas,\r"Hector and Aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the Trojans and Lycians,\rfor you are foremost at all times, alike in fight and counsel; hold\ryour ground here, and go about among the host to rally them in front\rof the gates, or they will fling themselves into the arms of their\rwives, to the great joy of our foes. Then, when you have put heart\rinto all our companies, we will stand firm here and fight the Danaans\rhowever hard they press us, for there is nothing else to be done.\rMeanwhile do you, Hector, go to the city and tell our mother what\ris happening. Tell her to bid the matrons gather at the temple of\rMinerva in the acropolis; let her then take her key and open the doors\rof the sacred building; there, upon the knees of Minerva, let her\rlay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house- the one she sets\rmost store by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice twelve yearling\rheifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of the goddess,\rif she will take pity on the town, with the wives and little ones\rof the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from falling on the goodly\rcity of Ilius; for he fights with fury and fills men\'s souls with\rpanic. I hold him mightiest of them all; we did not fear even their\rgreat champion Achilles, son of a goddess though he be, as we do this\rman: his rage is beyond all bounds, and there is none can vie with\rhim in prowess" \r\rHector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot, and\rwent about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears, urging\rthe men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle. Thereon\rthey rallied and again faced the Achaeans, who gave ground and ceased\rtheir murderous onset, for they deemed that some one of the immortals\rhad come down from starry heaven to help the Trojans, so strangely\rhad they rallied. And Hector shouted to the Trojans, "Trojans and\rallies, be men, my friends, and fight with might and main, while I\rgo to Ilius and tell the old men of our council and our wives to pray\rto the gods and vow hecatombs in their honour." \r\rWith this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went round\rhis shield beat against his neck and his ancles. \r\rThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into the\ropen space between the hosts to fight in single combat. When they\rwere close up to one another Diomed of the loud war-cry was the first\rto speak. "Who, my good sir," said he, "who are you among men? I have\rnever seen you in battle until now, but you are daring beyond all\rothers if you abide my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons face\rmy might. If, however, you are one of the immortals and have come\rdown from heaven, I will not fight you; for even valiant Lycurgus,\rson of Dryas, did not live long when he took to fighting with the\rgods. He it was that drove the nursing women who were in charge of\rfrenzied Bacchus through the land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi\ron the ground as murderous Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. Bacchus\rhimself plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him\rto her bosom to comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which\rthe man reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at ease were angry\rwith Lycurgus and the son of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he live\rmuch longer after he had become hateful to the immortals. Therefore\rI will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are of them that\reat the fruit of the ground, draw near and meet your doom."\r\rAnd the son of Hippolochus answered, son of Tydeus, why ask me of\rmy lineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees.\rThose of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when spring returns\rthe forest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with the generations\rof mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away. If, then,\ryou would learn my descent, it is one that is well known to many.\rThere is a city in the heart of Argos, pasture land of horses, called\rEphyra, where Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest of all mankind.\rHe was the son of Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus, who was father\rto Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most surpassing comeliness\rand beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, and being stronger than\rhe, drove him from the land of the Argives, over which Jove had made\rhim ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted after him, and would\rhave had him lie with her in secret; but Bellerophon was an honourable\rman and would not, so she told lies about him to Proteus. \'Proetus,\'\rsaid she, \'kill Bellerophon or die, for he would have had converse\rwith me against my will.\' The king was angered, but shrank from killing\rBellerophon, so he sent him to Lycia with lying letters of introduction,\rwritten on a folded tablet, and containing much ill against the bearer.\rHe bade Bellerophon show these letters to his father-in-law, to the\rend that he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to Lycia,\rand the gods convoyed him safely. \r\r"When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the king received\rhim with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nine heifers\rin his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared upon the tenth\rday, he questioned him and desired to see the letter from his son-in-law\rProetus. When he had received the wicked letter he first commanded\rBellerophon to kill that savage monster, the Chimaera, who was not\ra human being, but a goddess, for she had the head of a lion and the\rtail of a serpent, while her body was that of a goat, and she breathed\rforth flames of fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for he was guided\rby signs from heaven. He next fought the far-famed Solymi, and this,\rhe said, was the hardest of all his battles. Thirdly, he killed the\rAmazons, women who were the peers of men, and as he was returning\rthence the king devised yet another plan for his destruction; he picked\rthe bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placed them in ambuscade, but\rnot a man ever came back, for Bellerophon killed every one of them.\rThen the king knew that he must be the valiant offspring of a god,\rso he kept him in Lycia, gave him his daughter in marriage, and made\rhim of equal honour in the kingdom with himself; and the Lycians gave\rhim a piece of land, the best in all the country, fair with vineyards\rand tilled fields, to have and to hold. \r\r"The king\'s daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander, Hippolochus,\rand Laodameia. Jove, the lord of counsel, lay with Laodameia, and\rshe bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophon came to be hated\rby all the gods, he wandered all desolate and dismayed upon the Alean\rplain, gnawing at his own heart, and shunning the path of man. Mars,\rinsatiate of battle, killed his son Isander while he was fighting\rthe Solymi; his daughter was killed by Diana of the golden reins,\rfor she was angered with her; but Hippolochus was father to myself,\rand when he sent me to Troy he urged me again and again to fight ever\ramong the foremost and outvie my peers, so as not to shame the blood\rof my fathers who were the noblest in Ephyra and in all Lycia. This,\rthen, is the descent I claim." \r\rThus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He planted his\rspear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words. "Then,"\rhe said, you are an old friend of my father\'s house. Great Oeneus\ronce entertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and the two exchanged\rpresents. Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple, and Bellerophon a double\rcup, which I left at home when I set out for Troy. I do not remember\rTydeus, for he was taken from us while I was yet a child, when the\rarmy of the Achaeans was cut to pieces before Thebes. Henceforth,\rhowever, I must be your host in middle Argos, and you mine in Lycia,\rif I should ever go there; let us avoid one another\'s spears even\rduring a general engagement; there are many noble Trojans and allies\rwhom I can kill, if I overtake them and heaven delivers them into\rmy hand; so again with yourself, there are many Achaeans whose lives\ryou may take if you can; we two, then, will exchange armour, that\rall present may know of the old ties that subsist between us."\r\rWith these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one another\'s\rhands, and plighted friendship. But the son of Saturn made Glaucus\rtake leave of his wits, for he exchanged golden armour for bronze,\rthe worth of a hundred head of cattle for the worth of nine.\r\rNow when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the wives\rand daughters of the Trojans came running towards him to ask after\rtheir sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told them to set about\rpraying to the gods, and many were made sorrowful as they heard him.\r\rPresently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned with\rcolonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty bedchambers- all\rof hewn stone- built near one another, where the sons of Priam slept,\reach with his wedded wife. Opposite these, on the other side the courtyard,\rthere were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for Priam\'s daughters,\rbuilt near one another, where his sons-in-law slept with their wives.\rWhen Hector got there, his fond mother came up to him with Laodice\rthe fairest of her daughters. She took his hand within her own and\rsaid, "My son, why have you left the battle to come hither? Are the\rAchaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard about the city that you\rhave thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Jove from the citadel?\rWait till I can bring you wine that you may make offering to Jove\rand to the other immortals, and may then drink and be refreshed. Wine\rgives a man fresh strength when he is wearied, as you now are with\rfighting on behalf of your kinsmen." \r\rAnd Hector answered, "Honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you unman\rme and I forget my strength. I dare not make a drink-offering to Jove\rwith unwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood and filth may\rnot pray to the son of Saturn. Get the matrons together, and go with\rofferings to the temple of Minerva driver of the spoil; there, upon\rthe knees of Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you have in\ryour house- the one you set most store by; promise, moreover, to sacrifice\rtwelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the\rtemple of the goddess if she will take pity on the town, with the\rwives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from\roff the goodly city of Ilius, for he fights with fury, and fills men\'s\rsouls with panic. Go, then, to the temple of Minerva, while I seek\rParis and exhort him, if he will hear my words. Would that the earth\rmight open her jaws and swallow him, for Jove bred him to be the bane\rof the Trojans, and of Priam and Priam\'s sons. Could I but see him\rgo down into the house of Hades, my heart would forget its heaviness."\r\rHis mother went into the house and called her waiting-women who gathered\rthe matrons throughout the city. She then went down into her fragrant\rstore-room, where her embroidered robes were kept, the work of Sidonian\rwomen, whom Alexandrus had brought over from Sidon when he sailed\rthe seas upon that voyage during which he carried off Helen. Hecuba\rtook out the largest robe, and the one that was most beautifully enriched\rwith embroidery, as an offering to Minerva: it glittered like a star,\rand lay at the very bottom of the chest. With this she went on her\rway and many matrons with her. \r\rWhen they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughter of\rCisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the doors, for the Trojans had\rmade her priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their hands to\rthe goddess with a loud cry, and Theano took the robe to lay it upon\rthe knees of Minerva, praying the while to the daughter of great Jove.\r"Holy Minerva," she cried, "protectress of our city, mighty goddess,\rbreak the spear of Diomed and lay him low before the Scaean gates.\rDo this, and we will sacrifice twelve heifers that have never yet\rknown the goad, in your temple, if you will have pity upon the town,\rwith the wives and little ones If the Trojans." Thus she prayed, but\rPallas Minerva granted not her prayer. \r\rWhile they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove, Hector\rwent to the fair house of Alexandrus, which he had built for him by\rthe foremost builders in the land. They had built him his house, storehouse,\rand courtyard near those of Priam and Hector on the acropolis. Here\rHector entered, with a spear eleven cubits long in his hand; the bronze\rpoint gleamed in front of him, and was fastened to the shaft of the\rspear by a ring of gold. He found Alexandrus within the house, busied\rabout his armour, his shield and cuirass, and handling his curved\rbow; there, too, sat Argive Helen with her women, setting them their\rseveral tasks; and as Hector saw him he rebuked him with words of\rscorn. "Sir," said he, "you do ill to nurse this rancour; the people\rperish fighting round this our town; you would yourself chide one\rwhom you saw shirking his part in the combat. Up then, or ere long\rthe city will be in a blaze." \r\rAnd Alexandrus answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just; listen therefore,\rand believe me when I tell you that I am not here so much through\rrancour or ill-will towards the Trojans, as from a desire to indulge\rmy grief. My wife was even now gently urging me to battle, and I hold\rit better that I should go, for victory is ever fickle. Wait, then,\rwhile I put on my armour, or go first and I will follow. I shall be\rsure to overtake you." \r\rHector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. "Brother," said\rshe, "to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwind had caught\rme up on the day my mother brought me forth, and had borne me to some\rmountain or to the waves of the roaring sea that should have swept\rme away ere this mischief had come about. But, since the gods have\rdevised these evils, would, at any rate, that I had been wife to a\rbetter man- to one who could smart under dishonour and men\'s evil\rspeeches. This fellow was never yet to be depended upon, nor never\rwill be, and he will surely reap what he has sown. Still, brother,\rcome in and rest upon this seat, for it is you who bear the brunt\rof that toil that has been caused by my hateful self and by the sin\rof Alexandrus- both of whom Jove has doomed to be a theme of song\ramong those that shall be born hereafter." \r\rAnd Hector answered, "Bid me not be seated, Helen, for all the goodwill\ryou bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help the Trojans, who\rmiss me greatly when I am not among them; but urge your husband, and\rof his own self also let him make haste to overtake me before I am\rout of the city. I must go home to see my household, my wife and my\rlittle son, for I know not whether I shall ever again return to them,\ror whether the gods will cause me to fill by the hands of the Achaeans."\r\rThen Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did not\rfind Andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and one of\rher maids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was not within,\rhe stood on the threshold of the women\'s rooms and said, "Women, tell\rme, and tell me true, where did Andromache go when she left the house?\rWas it to my sisters, or to my brothers\' wives? or is she at the temple\rof Minerva where the other women are propitiating the awful goddess?"\r\rHis good housekeeper answered, "Hector, since you bid me tell you\rtruly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers\' wives,\rnor yet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women are propitiating\rthe awful goddess, but she is on the high wall of Ilius, for she had\rheard the Trojans were being hard pressed, and that the Achaeans were\rin great force: she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and the nurse\rwent with her carrying the child." \r\rHector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and went\rdown the streets by the same way that he had come. When he had gone\rthrough the city and had reached the Scaean gates through which he\rwould go out on to the plain, his wife came running towards him, Andromache,\rdaughter of great Eetion who ruled in Thebe under the wooded slopes\rof Mt. Placus, and was king of the Cilicians. His daughter had married\rHector, and now came to meet him with a nurse who carried his little\rchild in her bosom- a mere babe. Hector\'s darling son, and lovely\ras a star. Hector had named him Scamandrius, but the people called\rhim Astyanax, for his father stood alone as chief guardian of Ilius.\rHector smiled as he looked upon the boy, but he did not speak, and\rAndromache stood by him weeping and taking his hand in her own. "Dear\rhusband," said she, "your valour will bring you to destruction; think\ron your infant son, and on my hapless self who ere long shall be your\rwidow- for the Achaeans will set upon you in a body and kill you.\rIt would be better for me, should I lose you, to lie dead and buried,\rfor I shall have nothing left to comfort me when you are gone, save\ronly sorrow. I have neither father nor mother now. Achilles slew my\rfather when he sacked Thebe the goodly city of the Cilicians. He slew\rhim, but did not for very shame despoil him; when he had burned him\rin his wondrous armour, he raised a barrow over his ashes and the\rmountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, planted a grove\rof elms about his tomb. I had seven brothers in my father\'s house,\rbut on the same day they all went within the house of Hades. Achilles\rkilled them as they were with their sheep and cattle. My mother- her\rwho had been queen of all the land under Mt. Placus- he brought hither\rwith the spoil, and freed her for a great sum, but the archer- queen\rDiana took her in the house of your father. Nay- Hector- you who to\rme are father, mother, brother, and dear husband- have mercy upon\rme; stay here upon this wall; make not your child fatherless, and\ryour wife a widow; as for the host, place them near the fig-tree,\rwhere the city can be best scaled, and the wall is weakest. Thrice\rhave the bravest of them come thither and assailed it, under the two\rAjaxes, Idomeneus, the sons of Atreus, and the brave son of Tydeus,\reither of their own bidding, or because some soothsayer had told them."\r\rAnd Hector answered, "Wife, I too have thought upon all this, but\rwith what face should I look upon the Trojans, men or women, if I\rshirked battle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save\rto fight bravely in the forefront of the Trojan host and win renown\ralike for my father and myself. Well do I know that the day will surely\rcome when mighty Ilius shall be destroyed with Priam and Priam\'s people,\rbut I grieve for none of these- not even for Hecuba, nor King Priam,\rnor for my brothers many and brave who may fall in the dust before\rtheir foes- for none of these do I grieve as for yourself when the\rday shall come on which some one of the Achaeans shall rob you for\rever of your freedom, and bear you weeping away. It may be that you\rwill have to ply the loom in Argos at the bidding of a mistress, or\rto fetch water from the springs Messeis or Hypereia, treated brutally\rby some cruel task-master; then will one say who sees you weeping,\r\'She was wife to Hector, the bravest warrior among the Trojans during\rthe war before Ilius.\' On this your tears will break forth anew for\rhim who would have put away the day of captivity from you. May I lie\rdead under the barrow that is heaped over my body ere I hear your\rcry as they carry you into bondage." \r\rHe stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and nestled\rin his nurse\'s bosom, scared at the sight of his father\'s armour,\rand at the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from his helmet.\rHis father and mother laughed to see him, but Hector took the helmet\rfrom his head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground. Then he took\rhis darling child, kissed him, and dandled him in his arms, praying\rover him the while to Jove and to all the gods. "Jove," he cried,\r"grant that this my child may be even as myself, chief among the Trojans;\rlet him be not less excellent in strength, and let him rule Ilius\rwith his might. Then may one say of him as he comes from battle, \'The\rson is far better than the father.\' May he bring back the blood-stained\rspoils of him whom he has laid low, and let his mother\'s heart be\rglad.\'" \r\rWith this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who took\rhim to her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. As her husband\rwatched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed her fondly,\rsaying, "My own wife, do not take these things too bitterly to heart.\rNo one can hurry me down to Hades before my time, but if a man\'s hour\ris come, be he brave or be he coward, there is no escape for him when\rhe has once been born. Go, then, within the house, and busy yourself\rwith your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering\rof your servants; for war is man\'s matter, and mine above all others\rof them that have been born in Ilius." \r\rHe took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went back\ragain to her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back towards\rhim. When she reached her home she found her maidens within, and bade\rthem all join in her lament; so they mourned Hector in his own house\rthough he was yet alive, for they deemed that they should never see\rhim return safe from battle, and from the furious hands of the Achaeans.\r\rParis did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly armour\roverlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast as his feet\rcould take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose and gallops\rgloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to bathe in\rthe fair-flowing river- he holds his head high, and his mane streams\rupon his shoulders as he exults in his strength and flies like the\rwind to the haunts and feeding ground of the mares- even so went forth\rParis from high Pergamus, gleaming like sunlight in his armour, and\rhe laughed aloud as he sped swiftly on his way. Forthwith he came\rupon his brother Hector, who was then turning away from the place\rwhere he had held converse with his wife, and he was himself the first\rto speak. "Sir," said he, "I fear that I have kept you waiting when\ryou are in haste, and have not come as quickly as you bade me."\r\r"My good brother," answered Hector, you fight bravely, and no man\rwith any justice can make light of your doings in battle. But you\rare careless and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hear\rthe ill that the Trojans speak about you, for they have suffered much\ron your account. Let us be going, and we will make things right hereafter,\rshould Jove vouchsafe us to set the cup of our deliverance before\rever-living gods of heaven in our own homes, when we have chased the\rAchaeans from Troy." \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK VII\r\rWith these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother\rAlexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends\ra breeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and have\rlaboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even so welcome\rwas the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans. \r\rThereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he lived\rin Ame, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and of Phylomedusa.\rHector threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead with a wound in\rthe neck under the bronze rim of his helmet. Glaucus, moreover, son\rof Hippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in hard hand-to-hand fight\rsmote Iphinous son of Dexius on the shoulder, as he was springing\ron to his chariot behind his fleet mares; so he fell to earth from\rthe car, and there was no life left in him. \r\rWhen, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the Argives,\rshe darted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus, and Apollo,\rwho was looking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for he wanted\rthe Trojans to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, and King\rApollo son of Jove was first to speak. "What would you have said he,\r"daughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sent you hither\rfrom Olympus? Have you no pity upon the Trojans, and would you incline\rthe scales of victory in favour of the Danaans? Let me persuade you-\rfor it will be better thus- stay the combat for to-day, but let them\rrenew the fight hereafter till they compass the doom of Ilius, since\ryou goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city."\r\rAnd Minerva answered, "So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind that\rI came down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me, then,\rhow do you propose to end this present fighting?" \r\rApollo, son of Jove, replied, "Let us incite great Hector to challenge\rsome one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the Achaeans will\rbe shamed into finding a man who will fight him." \r\rMinerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel of\rthe gods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, "Hector son of\rPriam, peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then persuade\ryou. Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take their seats,\rand challenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet you in single\rcombat. I have heard the voice of the ever-living gods, and the hour\rof your doom is not yet come." \r\rHector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the Trojans,\rgrasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and they all sat\rdown. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. But Minerva and\rApollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on father Jove\'s high\roak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat close ranged together,\rbristling with shield and helmet and spear. As when the rising west\rwind furs the face of the sea and the waters grow dark beneath it,\rso sat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon the plain. And Hector\rspoke thus:- \r\r"Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am minded;\rJove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants to nothing,\rand foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take the towers\rof Troy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. The princes of\rthe Achaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him, then,\rthat will fight me stand forward as your champion against Hector.\rThus I say, and may Jove be witness between us. If your champion slay\rme, let him strip me of my armour and take it to your ships, but let\rhim send my body home that the Trojans and their wives may give me\rmy dues of fire when I am dead. In like manner, if Apollo vouchsafe\rme glory and I slay your champion, I will strip him of his armour\rand take it to the city of Ilius, where I will hang it in the temple\rof Apollo, but I will give up his body, that the Achaeans may bury\rhim at their ships, and the build him a mound by the wide waters of\rthe Hellespont. Then will one say hereafter as he sails his ship over\rthe sea, \'This is the monument of one who died long since a champion\rwho was slain by mighty Hector.\' Thus will one say, and my fame shall\rnot be lost." \r\rThus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to decline\rthe challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaus rose\rand rebuked them, for he was angry. "Alas," he cried, "vain braggarts,\rwomen forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon\rus if no man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned\revery man of you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious\rin your places. I will myself go out against this man, but the upshot\rof the fight will be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods."\r\rWith these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your\rlife would have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for\rhe was far better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung\rupon you and checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand\rand said, "Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be patient\rin spite of passion, do not think of fighting a man so much stronger\rthan yourself as Hector son of Priam, who is feared by many another\ras well as you. Even Achilles, who is far more doughty than you are,\rshrank from meeting him in battle. Sit down your own people, and the\rAchaeans will send some other champion to fight Hector; fearless and\rfond of battle though he be, I ween his knees will bend gladly under\rhim if he comes out alive from the hurly-burly of this fight."\r\rWith these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother, whereon\rhis squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders. Then\rNestor rose and spoke, "Of a truth," said he, "the Achaean land is\rfallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor and orator\ramong the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house to question me\rconcerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. How would it not\rgrieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before Hector? Many\ra time would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul might leave\rhis body and go down within the house of Hades. Would, by father Jove,\rMinerva, and Apollo, that I were still young and strong as when the\rPylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Celadon\runder the walls of Pheia, and round about the waters of the river\rIardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their champion,\rwith the armour of King Areithous upon his shoulders- Areithous whom\rmen and women had surnamed \'the Mace-man,\' because he fought neither\rwith bow nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his iron\rmace. Lycurgus killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him\rin a narrow way where his mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus\rwas too quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell\rto earth on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him of the armour which\rMars had given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when\rhe grew old and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire\rEreuthalion, who in this same armour challenged the foremost men among\rus. The others quaked and quailed, but my high spirit bade me fight\rhim though none other would venture; I was the youngest man of them\rall; but when I fought him Minerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the\rbiggest and strongest man that ever I killed, and covered much ground\ras he lay sprawling upon the earth. Would that I were still young\rand strong as I then was, for the son of Priam would then soon find\rone who would face him. But you, foremost among the whole host though\ryou be, have none of you any stomach for fighting Hector."\r\rThus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started to\rtheir feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after him brave\rDiomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men clothed in\rvalour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his brother\rin arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon, Thoas the son of Andraemon,\rand Ulysses also rose. Then Nestor knight of Gerene again spoke, saying:\r"Cast lots among you to see who shall be chosen. If he come alive\rout of this fight he will have done good service alike to his own\rsoul and to the Achaeans." \r\rThus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had thrown\rit into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people lifted their\rhands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he looked into\rthe vault of heaven, "Father Jove, grant that the lot fall on Ajax,\ror on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycene himself."\r\rAs they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, and\rfrom it there fell the very lot which they wanted- the lot of Ajax.\rThe herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of the\rAchaeans, going from left to right; but they none of of them owned\rit. When, however, in due course he reached the man who had written\rupon it and had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand,\rand the herald gave him the lot. When Ajax saw him mark he knew it\rand was glad; he threw it to the ground and said, "My friends, the\rlot is mine, and I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put\ron my armour; meanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among yourselves\rthat the Trojans may not hear you- or aloud if you will, for we fear\rno man. None shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for\rI was born and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things."\r\rWith this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thus\rwould one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, "Father\rJove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory\rto Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hector\ralso and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and prowess.\r\rThus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming bronze.\rWhen he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous Mars when\rhe takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with one another-\reven so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, spring forward with\ra grim smile on his face as he brandished his long spear and strode\ronward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him, but the Trojans\rtrembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hector beat quickly,\rbut he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks behind him,\rfor he had been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his shield in\rfront of him like a wall- a shield of bronze with seven folds of oxhide-\rthe work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far the best worker\rin leather. He had made it with the hides of seven full-fed bulls,\rand over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. Holding this\rshield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector, and\rmenaced him saying, "Hector, you shall now learn, man to man, what\rkind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lion-hearted\rAchilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at the ships in\ranger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of\rus who are well able to face you; therefore begin the fight."\r\rAnd Hector answered, "Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the host,\rtreat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannot fight.\rI have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle. I am\rquick to turn my leathern shield either to right or left, for this\rI deem the main thing in battle. I can charge among the chariots and\rhorsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Mars;\rhowbeit I would not take such a man as you are off his guard- but\rI will smite you openly if I can." \r\rHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struck\rthe sevenfold shield in its outermost layer- the eighth, which was\rof bronze- and went through six of the layers but in the seventh hide\rit stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round shield\rof the son of Priam. The terrible spear went through his gleaming\rshield, and pressed onward through his cuirass of cunning workmanship;\rit pierced the shirt against his side, but he swerved and thus saved\rhis life. They then each of them drew out the spear from his shield,\rand fell on one another like savage lions or wild boars of great strength\rand endurance: the son of Priam struck the middle of Ajax\'s shield,\rbut the bronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned.\rAjax then sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector; the spear\rwent through it and staggered him as he was springing forward to attack;\rit gashed his neck and the blood came pouring from the wound, but\reven so Hector did not cease fighting; he gave ground, and with his\rbrawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, that was lying upon the\rplain; with this he struck the shield of Ajax on the boss that was\rin its middle, so that the bronze rang again. But Ajax in turn caught\rup a far larger stone, swung it aloft, and hurled it with prodigious\rforce. This millstone of a rock broke Hector\'s shield inwards and\rthrew him down on his back with the shield crushing him under it,\rbut Apollo raised him at once. Thereon they would have hacked at one\ranother in close combat with their swords, had not heralds, messengers\rof gods and men, come forward, one from the Trojans and the other\rfrom the Achaeans- Talthybius and Idaeus both of them honourable men;\rthese parted them with their staves, and the good herald Idaeus said,\r"My sons, fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both are\rdear to Jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the behests\rof night may not be well gainsaid." \r\rAjax son of Telamon answered, "Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it was\rhe that challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I will accept\rhis saying." \r\rThen Hector said, "Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and strength,\rand judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all others of the\rAchaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we will fight\ranew till heaven decide between us, and give victory to one or to\rthe other; night is now falling, and the behests of night may not\rbe well gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts of the Achaeans at your\rships, and more especially those of your own followers and clansmen,\rwhile I, in the great city of King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans\rand their women, who vie with one another in their prayers on my behalf.\rLet us, moreover, exchange presents that it may be said among the\rAchaeans and Trojans, \'They fought with might and main, but were reconciled\rand parted in friendship.\' \r\rOn this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and leathern\rbaldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with purple. Thus\rthey parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans, and the other\rto that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw their hero come\rto them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty Ajax. They\rled him, therefore, to the city as one that had been saved beyond\rtheir hopes. On the other side the Achaeans brought Ajax elated with\rvictory to Agamemnon. \r\rWhen they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon sacrificed\rfor them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the son of Saturn.\rThey flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into joints;\rthese they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting them on the\rspits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them off. When\rthey had done all this and had prepared the feast, they ate it, and\revery man had his full and equal share, so that all were satisfied,\rand King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin,\ras a mark of special honour. As soon as they had had enough to cat\rand drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak;\rwith all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:-\r\r"Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the Achaeans\rare now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of the Scamander,\rand their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, it will be well\rwhen morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will then wheel\rour dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not far from the\rships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of our comrades\rhome to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow\rthat shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let\rus set about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our ships,\rand let it have well-made gates that there may be a way through them\rfor our chariots. Close outside we will dig a deep trench all round\rit to keep off both horse and foot, that the Trojan chieftains may\rnot bear hard upon us." \r\rThus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile the\rTrojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis\rby the gates of King Priam\'s palace; and wise Antenor spoke. "Hear\rme he said, "Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even\ras I am minded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the\rsons of Atreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn\rcovenants, and shall not prosper till we have done as I say."\r\rHe then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to speak.\r"Antenor," said he, "your words are not to my liking; you can find\ra better saying than this if you will; if, however, you have spoken\rin good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your reason.\rI will speak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans that I will\rnot give up the woman; but the wealth that I brought home with her\rfrom Argos I will restore, and will add yet further of my own."\r\rOn this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the race\rof Dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity\rand goodwill addressed them thus: "Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and\rallies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers now\ras hitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful.\rAt daybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and Menelaus\rsons of Atreus the saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel\rhas come about; and let him also be instant with them that they now\rcease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew,\rtill heaven decide between us and give victory to one or to the other."\r\rThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took supper\rin their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his wa to the ships.\rHe found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern of\rAgamemnon\'s ship, and took his place in the midst of them. "Son of\rAtreus," he said, "and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and the\rother noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of Alexandrus\rthrough whom this quarrel has come about, if so be that you may find\rit acceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his ships to Troy-\rwould that he had sooner perished- he will restore, and will add yet\rfurther of his own, but he will not give up the wedded wife of Menelaus,\rthough the Trojans would have him do so. Priam bade me inquire further\rif you will cease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will\rfight anew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one\ror to the other." \r\rThey all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud war-cry\rspoke, saying, "Let there be no taking, neither treasure, nor yet\rHelen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans is at\rhand." \r\rThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomed\rhad spoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, "Idaeus, you\rhave heard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But as\rconcerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men are\ronce dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let\rJove the mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant."\r\rAs he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods, and\rIdaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and Dardanians\rwere gathered in council waiting his return; when he came, he stood\rin their midst and delivered his message. As soon as they heard it\rthey set about their twofold labour, some to gather the corpses, and\rothers to bring in wood. The Argives on their part also hastened from\rtheir ships, some to gather the corpses, and others to bring in wood.\r\rThe sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into the\rvault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, when\rthe two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but they\rwashed the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, and lifted\rthem upon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to wail aloud,\rso they heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and having\rburned them went back to the city of Ilius. The Achaeans in like manner\rheaped their dead sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned\rthem went back to their ships. \r\rNow in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the\rAchaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that was\rraised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall\rto shelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates that\rthere might be a way through them for their chariots, and close outside\rit they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within with\rstakes. \r\rThus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jove\rthe lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune,\rlord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, "Father Jove, what mortal in\rthe whole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you\rnot how the Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven\ra trench all round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The\rThe fame of this wall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will\rno longer think anything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself\rbuilt with so much labour for Laomedon." \r\rJove was displeased and answered, "What, O shaker of the earth, are\ryou talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be alarmed\rat what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn itself.\rSurely when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships, you can\rshatter their wall and Ring it into the sea; you can cover the beach\rwith sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be utterly\reffaced." \r\rThus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans was\rcompleted; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got their\rsupper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus\rthe son of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freighted\rthem with ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially to\rthe sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply the Achaeans\rbought their wine, some with bronze, some with iron, some with hides,\rsome with whole heifers, and some again with captives. They spread\ra goodly banquet and feasted the whole night through, as also did\rthe Trojans and their allies in the city. But all the time Jove boded\rthem ill and roared with his portentous thunder. Pale fear got hold\rupon them, and they spilled the wine from their cups on to the ground,\rnor did any dare drink till he had made offerings to the most mighty\rson of Saturn. Then they laid themselves down to rest and enjoyed\rthe boon of sleep. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK VIII\r\rNow when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuse\rlight over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on the topmost\rcrest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gave\rear. "Hear me," said he, "gods and goddesses, that I may speak even\ras I am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor god try to cross\rme, but obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to an\rend. If I see anyone acting apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans,\rhe shall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again to Olympus;\ror I will hurl him down into dark Tartarus far into the deepest pit\runder the earth, where the gates are iron and the floor bronze, as\rfar beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, that you may\rlearn how much the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find out for\ryourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it\rall of you, gods and goddesses together- tug as you will, you will\rnot drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to earth; but were\rI to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth and sea into\rthe bargain, then would I bind the chain about some pinnacle of Olympus\rand leave you all dangling in the mid firmament. So far am I above\rall others either of gods or men." \r\rThey were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he had\rspoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, "Father, son of\rSaturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to be gainsaid,\rbut we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors, who are perishing and\rcoming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain\rfrom actual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to\rthe Argives that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure."\r\rJove smiled at her and answered, "Take heart, my child, Trito-born;\rI am not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to you."\r\rWith this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and manes\rof glittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about the body,\rseized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon he\rlashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixt\rearth and starry heaven. After a while he reached many-fountained\rIda, mother of wild beasts, and Gargarus, where are his grove and\rfragrant altar. There the father of gods and men stayed his horses,\rtook them from the chariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then he\rtook his seat all glorious upon the topmost crests, looking down upon\rthe city of Troy and the ships of the Achaeans. \r\rThe Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and afterwards\rput on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand likewise armed\rthemselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but nevertheless\reager perforce to do battle for their wives and children. All the\rgates were flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth with\rthe tramp as of a great multitude. \r\rWhen they were got together in one place, shield clashed with shield,\rand spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mighty was\rthe din as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another- death-\rcry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red\rwith blood. \r\rNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their weapons\rbeat against one another, and the people fell, but when the sun had\rreached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his golden scales, and\rput two fates of death within them, one for the Trojans and the other\rfor the Achaeans. He took the balance by the middle, and when he lifted\rit up the day of the Achaeans sank; the death-fraught scale of the\rAchaeans settled down upon the ground, while that of the Trojans rose\rheavenwards. Then he thundered aloud from Ida, and sent the glare\rof his lightning upon the Achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear\rfell upon them and they were sore afraid. \r\rIdomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two Ajaxes,\rservants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of Gerene alone\rstood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, but one\rof his horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen had\rhit it with an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane begins\rto grow away from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded\rin his anguish as the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threw\rothers into confusion. The old man instantly began cutting the traces\rwith his sword, but Hector\'s fleet horses bore down upon him through\rthe rout with their bold charioteer, even Hector himself, and the\rold man would have perished there and then had not Diomed been quick\rto mark, and with a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.\r\r"Ulysses," he cried, "noble son of Laertes where are you flying to,\rwith your back turned like a coward? See that you are not struck with\ra spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defend Nestor\rfrom this man\'s furious onset." \r\rUlysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the Achaeans,\rand the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the thick of the\rfight took his stand before the horses of the son of Neleus. "Sir,"\rsaid he, "these young warriors are pressing you hard, your force is\rspent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught, and your\rhorses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and see what the horses\rof Tros can do- how cleverly they can scud hither and thither over\rthe plain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them from the hero\rAeneas. Let our squires attend to your own steeds, but let us drive\rmine straight at the Trojans, that Hector may learn how furiously\rI too can wield my spear." \r\rNestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the doughty\rsquires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor\'s horses,\rwhile the two both mounted Diomed\'s chariot. Nestor took the reins\rin his hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up with\rHector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he was charging\rfull speed towards them. He missed him, but struck his charioteer\rand squire Eniopeus son of noble Thebaeus in the breast by the nipple\rwhile the reins were in his hands, so that he died there and then,\rand the horses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot. Hector\rwas greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let him lie\rfor all his sorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor\rdid his steeds have to go long without one, for he presently found\rbrave Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made him get up behind\rthe horses, giving the reins into his hand. \r\rAll had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have been\rpenned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and men been\rquick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which fell just\rin front of Diomed\'s horses with a flare of burning brimstone. The\rhorses were frightened and tried to back beneath the car, while the\rreins dropped from Nestor\'s hands. Then he was afraid and said to\rDiomed, "Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; see you not that\rthe hand of Jove is against you? To-day he vouchsafes victory to Hector;\rto-morrow, if it so please him, he will again grant it to ourselves;\rno man, however brave, may thwart the purpose of Jove, for he is far\rstronger than any." \r\rDiomed answered, "All that you have said is true; there is a grief\rhowever which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will talk among\rthe Trojans and say, \'The son of Tydeus fled before me to the ships.\'\rThis is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallow me."\r\r"Son of Tydeus," replied Nestor, "what mean you? Though Hector say\rthat you are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe\rhim, nor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low."\r\rSo saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle,\rand with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained their\rdarts after them. Hector shouted to him and said, "Son of Tydeus,\rthe Danaans have done you honour hitherto as regards your place at\rtable, the meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.\rHenceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better than\ra woman. Be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale\rour walls through any Hinching upon my part; neither shall you carry\roff our wives in your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand."\r\rThe son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his horses\rround again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thrice did Jove\rthunder from the heights of. Ida in token to the Trojans that he would\rturn the battle in their favour. Hector then shouted to them and said,\r"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of close fighting, be men,\rmy friends, and fight with might and with main; I see that Jove is\rminded to vouchsafe victory and great glory to myself, while he will\rdeal destruction upon the Danaans. Fools, for having thought of building\rthis weak and worthless wall. It shall not stay my fury; my horses\rwill spring lightly over their trench, and when I am at their ships\rforget not to bring me fire that I may burn them, while I slaughter\rthe Argives who will be all dazed and bewildered by the smoke."\r\rThen he cried to his horses, "Xanthus and Podargus, and you Aethon\rand goodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all the honey-sweet\rcorn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion has fed you, and\rfor she has mixed wine and water for you to drink whenever you would,\rbefore doing so even for me who am her own husband. Haste in pursuit,\rthat we may take the shield of Nestor, the fame of which ascends to\rheaven, for it is of solid gold, arm-rods and all, and that we may\rstrip from the shoulders of Diomed. the cuirass which Vulcan made\rhim. Could we take these two things, the Achaeans would set sail in\rtheir ships this self-same night." \r\rThus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she shook\rwith rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god of Neptune,\r"What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you find no compassion\rin your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring you many a welcome\roffering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish them well then. If all of us\rwho are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans back and keep Jove\rfrom helping them, he would have to sit there sulking alone on Ida."\r\rKing Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, "Juno, rash of tongue,\rwhat are you talking about? We other gods must not set ourselves against\rJove, for he is far stronger than we are." \r\rThus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch,\rfrom the ships even to the wall, was filled with horses and warriors,\rwho were pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now that the hand of\rJove was with him. He would even have set fire to the ships and burned\rthem, had not Queen Juno put it into the mind of Agamemnon, to bestir\rhimself and to encourage the Achaeans. To this end he went round the\rships and tents carrying a great purple cloak, and took his stand\rby the huge black hull of Ulysses\' ship, which was middlemost of all;\rit was from this place that his voice would carry farthest, on the\rone hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other\rtowards those of Achilles- for these two heroes, well assured of their\rown strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the two ends\rof the line. From this spot then, with a voice that could be heard\rafar, he shouted to the Danaans, saying, "Argives, shame on you cowardly\rcreatures, brave in semblance only; where are now our vaunts that\rwe should prove victorious- the vaunts we made so vaingloriously in\rLemnos, when we ate the flesh of horned cattle and filled our mixing-bowls\rto the brim? You vowed that you would each of you stand against a\rhundred or two hundred men, and now you prove no match even for one-\rfor Hector, who will be ere long setting our ships in a blaze. Father\rJove, did you ever so ruin a great king and rob him so utterly of\rhis greatness? yet, when to my sorrow I was coming hither, I never\rlet my ship pass your altars without offering the fat and thigh-bones\rof heifers upon every one of them, so eager was I to sack the city\rof Troy. Vouchsafe me then this prayer- suffer us to escape at any\rrate with our lives, and let not the Achaeans be so utterly vanquished\rby the Trojans." \r\rThus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed him\rthat his people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle,\rmost unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in its\rtalons; the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which the Achaeans\rsacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; When, therefore, the people\rsaw that the bird had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercely upon\rthe Trojans and fought more boldly. \r\rThere was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast that\rhe had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fight sooner\rthan the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so he slew\ran armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon. He had\rturned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the back\rmidway between his shoulders and went right through his chest, and\rhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell forward from his chariot.\r\rAfter him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two Ajaxes\rclothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and his companion in\rarms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus the brave son\rof Euaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took his place under\rcover of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajax lifted his shield\rTeucer would peer round, and when he had hit any one in the throng,\rthe man would fall dead; then Teucer would hie back to Ajax as a child\rto its mother, and again duck down under his shield. \r\rWhich of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and\rthen Ormenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlike Lycophontes,\rAmopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. these in turn did he lay\rlow upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he saw him making\rhavoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to him and said,\r"Teucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captain among the\rhost, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans and the glory\rof your father Telamon, who brought you up and took care of you in\rhis own house when you were a child, bastard though you were. Cover\rhim with glory though he is far off; I will promise and I will assuredly\rperform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant me to sack the city\rof Ilius, you shall have the next best meed of honour after my own-\ra tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who shall go\rup into your bed." \r\rAnd Teucer answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge\rme; from the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have never\rceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot and\rkill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been buried\rin the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot hit."\r\rAs he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was\rbent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hit\rPriam\'s brave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair Castianeira,\rlovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme, and now he bowed\rhis head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it is weighed down by\rshowers in spring- even thus heavy bowed his head beneath the weight\rof his helmet. \r\rAgain he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again\rhis arrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector\'s\rbrave charioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he\rwas driving furiously into the fight. The horses swerved aside as\rhe fell headlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him.\rHector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but for\rall his sorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brother\rCebriones, who was hard by, take the reins. Cebriones did as he had\rsaid. Hector thereon with a loud cry sprang from his chariot to the\rground, and seizing a great stone made straight for Teucer with intent\rkill him. Teucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid\rit upon the bow-string, but Hector struck him with the jagged stone\ras he was taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit\rhim just where the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest, a\rvery deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his wrist\rwas less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he fell forward on\rhis knees. Ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and running towards\rhim bestrode him and sheltered him with his shield. Meanwhile his\rtwo trusty squires, Mecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor, came up\rand bore him to the ships groaning in his great pain. \r\rJove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the Achaeans\rto their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at their head. As\ra hound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when he gives\rhim chase, and watches warily for his wheeling, even so did Hector\rfollow close upon the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost as they\rrushed panic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the set\rstakes and trench and many Achaeans had been laid low at the hands\rof the Trojans, they halted at their ships, calling upon one another\rand praying every man instantly as they lifted up their hands to the\rgods; but Hector wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes glaring\rlike those of Gorgo or murderous Mars. \r\rJuno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to Minerva,\r"Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take no more thought\rfor the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever do so? See\rhow they perish and come to a bad end before the onset of but a single\rman. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury, and has\ralready done great mischief." \r\rMinerva answered, "Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his own\rland, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Jove is\rmad with spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets\rhow often I saved his son when he was worn out by the labours Eurystheus\rhad laid on him. He would weep till his cry came up to heaven, and\rthen Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had the sense to\rforesee all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house of Hades,\rto fetch the hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have come back\ralive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jove hates\rme, while he lets Thetis have her way because she kissed his knees\rand took hold of his beard, when she was begging him to do honour\rto Achilles. I shall know what to do next time he begins calling me\rhis grey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go within the\rhouse of aegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; we shall then find\rout whether Priam\'s son Hector will be glad to meet us in the highways\rof battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds and vultures with\rthe fat of their flesh as they he dead by the ships of the Achaeans."\r\rThus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn,\robeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizened steeds,\rwhile Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung her richly vesture,\rmade with her own hands, on to the threshold of her father, and donned\rthe shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle. Then she stepped into\rher flaming chariot, and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and\rstrong with which she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased\rher. Juno lashed her horses, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they\rflew open of their own accord- gates over which the Hours preside,\rin whose hands are heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud\rthat hides them or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove\rtheir obedient steeds. \r\rBut father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sent\rwinged Iris with a message to them. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, turn\rthem back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come to\rfighting there will be mischief. This is what I say, and this is what\rI mean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl them\rfrom their chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them\rall ten years to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them;\rmy grey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her father\rmeans. I am less surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say\rshe always contradicts me." \r\rWith this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights of\rIda to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at the\router gates of its many valleys and gave them her message. "What,"\rsaid she, "are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn forbids going.\rThis is what he says, and this is he means to do, he will lame your\rhorses for you, he will hurl you from your chariot, and will break\rit in pieces. It will take you all ten years to heal the wounds his\rlightning will inflict upon you, that you may learn, grey-eyed goddess,\rwhat quarrelling with your father means. He is less hurt and angry\rwith Juno, for whatever he says she always contradicts him but you,\rbold bold hussy, will you really dare to raise your huge spear in\rdefiance of Jove?" \r\rWith this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, "Of a truth, child\rof aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men\'s battles further\rin defiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will have it, and\rlet Jove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans and Danaans according\rto his own pleasure." \r\rShe turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made them\rfast to their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against the\rend wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upon their\rgolden thrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they were\rvery angry. \r\rPresently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered the\rassembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his horses\rfor him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it. Jove\rthen sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneath him.\rMinerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither spoke nor\rasked him questions, but Jove knew what they meant, and said, "Minerva\rand Juno, why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killing so many\rof your dear friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such is the might\rof my hands that all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you were\rboth of you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its\rterrible doings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been-\rI should have struck you with lighting, and your chariots would never\rhave brought you back again to Olympus." \r\rMinerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and brooded\rmischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a word, for she\rwas in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her father;\rbut Juno could not contain herself and said, "What, dread son of Saturn,\rare you talking about? We know how great your power is, nevertheless\rwe have compassion upon the Danaan warriors who are perishing and\rcoming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain\rfrom actual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to\rthe Argives, that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure."\r\rAnd Jove answered, "To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do so,\ryou will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of the Argives,\rfor fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused the\rson of Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at their ships\'\rsterns about the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this is how it\ris decreed; for aught I care, you may go to the lowest depths beneath\rearth and sea, where Iapetus and Saturn dwell in lone Tartarus with\rneither ray of light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may go\ron and on till you get there, and I shall not care one whit for your\rdispleasure; you are the greatest vixen living." \r\rJuno made him no answer. The sun\'s glorious orb now sank into Oceanus\rand drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the Trojans when\rlight failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for did darkness\rfall upon the Achaeans. \r\rThen Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a council\ron the open space near the river, where there was a spot ear corpses.\rThey left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear the speech\rhe made them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the bronze point\rof which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the spear-head\rwas of gold Spear in hand he spoke. "Hear me," said he, "Trojans,\rDardanians, and allies. I deemed but now that I should destroy the\rships and all the Achaeans with them ere I went back to Ilius, but\rdarkness came on too soon. It was this alone that saved them and their\rships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obey the behests of\rnight, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of their chariots\rand give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to bring sheep\rand cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your horses\rand gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires\rwhose flare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may try to fly beyond\rthe sea by night, and they must not embark scatheless and unmolested;\rmany a man among them must take a dart with him to nurse at home,\rhit with spear or arrow as he is leaping on board his ship, that others\rmay fear to bring war and weeping upon the Trojans. Moreover let the\rheralds tell it about the city that the growing youths and grey-bearded\rmen are to camp upon its heaven-built walls. Let the women each of\rthem light a great fire in her house, and let watch be safely kept\rlest the town be entered by surprise while the host is outside. See\rto it, brave Trojans, as I have said, and let this suffice for the\rmoment; at daybreak I will instruct you further. I pray in hope to\rJove and to the gods that we may then drive those fate-sped hounds\rfrom our land, for \'tis the fates that have borne them and their ships\rhither. This night, therefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning\rlet us put on our armour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the\rAchaeans; I shall then know whether brave Diomed the son of Tydeus\rwill drive me back from the ships to the wall, or whether I shall\rmyself slay him and carry off his bloodstained spoils. To-morrow let\rhim show his mettle, abide my spear if he dare. I ween that at break\rof day, he shall be among the first to fall and many another of his\rcomrades round him. Would that I were as sure of being immortal and\rnever growing old, and of being worshipped like Minerva and Apollo,\ras I am that this day will bring evil to the Argives." \r\rThus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took their\rsweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast each by his\rown chariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from the city,\rthey brought wine also and corn from their houses and gathered much\rwood. They then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals, and\rthe wind carried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven- but the\rblessed gods partook not thereof, for they bitterly hated Ilius with\rPriam and Priam\'s people. Thus high in hope they sat through the livelong\rnight by the highways of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle.\rAs when the stars shine clear, and the moon is bright- there is not\ra breath of air, not a peak nor glade nor jutting headland but it\rstands out in the ineffable radiance that breaks from the serene of\rheaven; the stars can all of them be told and the heart of the shepherd\ris glad- even thus shone the watchfires of the Trojans before Ilius\rmidway between the ships and the river Xanthus. A thousand camp-fires\rgleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of each there sat fifty men,\rwhile the horses, champing oats and corn beside their chariots, waited\rtill dawn should come. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK IX\r\rThus did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood-stained Rout,\rhad taken fast hold of the Achaeans and their princes were all of\rthem in despair. As when the two winds that blow from Thrace- the\rnorth and the northwest- spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury\rof the main- in a moment the dark waves uprear their heads and scatter\rtheir sea-wrack in all directions- even thus troubled were the hearts\rof the Achaeans. \r\rThe son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a\rcouncil man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made haste\ralso himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in their assembly.\rAgamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream or cataract on the\rside of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh he spoke\rto the Achaeans. "My friends," said he, "princes and councillors of\rthe Argives, the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel\rJove gave me his solemn promise that I should sack the city of Troy\rbefore returning, but he has played me false, and is now bidding me\rgo ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people. Such is\rthe will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust as he\rwill yet lay others, for his power is above all. Now, therefore, let\rus all do as I say and sail back to our own country, for we shall\rnot take Troy." \r\rThus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while sat sorrowful\rthere, but they all held their peace, till at last Diomed of the loud\rbattle-cry made answer saying, "Son of Atreus, I will chide your folly,\ras is my right in council. Be not then aggrieved that I should do\rso. In the first place you attacked me before all the Danaans and\rsaid that I was a coward and no soldier. The Argives young and old\rknow that you did so. But the son of scheming Saturn endowed you by\rhalves only. He gave you honour as the chief ruler over us, but valour,\rwhich is the highest both right and might he did not give you. Sir,\rthink you that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike and\rcowardly as you say they are? If your own mind is set upon going home-\rgo- the way is open to you; the many ships that followed you from\rMycene stand ranged upon the seashore; but the rest of us stay here\rtill we have sacked Troy. Nay though these too should turn homeward\rwith their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still fight on till we\rreach the goal of Ilius, for for heaven was with us when we came."\r\rThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed,\rand presently Nestor rose to speak. "Son of Tydeus," said he, "in\rwar your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all\rwho are of your own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light of\rwhat you say nor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the end\rof the whole matter. You are still young- you might be the youngest\rof my own children- still you have spoken wisely and have counselled\rthe chief of the Achaeans not without discretion; nevertheless I am\rolder than you and I will tell you every" thing; therefore let no\rman, not even King Agamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that foments\rcivil discord is a clanless, hearthless outlaw. \r\r"Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers,\rbut let the sentinels every man of them camp by the trench that is\rwithout the wall. I am giving these instructions to the young men;\rwhen they have been attended to, do you, son of Atreus, give your\rorders, for you are the most royal among us all. Prepare a feast for\ryour councillors; it is right and reasonable that you should do so;\rthere is abundance of wine in your tents, which the ships of the Achaeans\rbring from Thrace daily. You have everything at your disposal wherewith\rto entertain guests, and you have many subjects. When many are got\rtogether, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest- and sorely\rdo we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has lit his watchfires\rhard by our ships. Who can be other than dismayed? This night will\reither be the ruin of our host, or save it." \r\rThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The sentinels\rwent out in their armour under command of Nestor\'s son Thrasymedes,\ra captain of the host, and of the bold warriors Ascalaphus and Ialmenus:\rthere were also Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyrus, and the son of Creion,\rnoble Lycomedes. There were seven captains of the sentinels, and with\reach there went a hundred youths armed with long spears: they took\rtheir places midway between the trench and the wall, and when they\rhad done so they lit their fires and got every man his supper.\r\rThe son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans to his\rquarters prepared a great feast in their honour. They laid their hands\ron the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had\renough to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose counsel was ever truest,\rwas the first to lay his mind before them. He, therefore, with all\rsincerity and goodwill addressed them thus. \r\r"With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\rwill I both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over much\rpeople. Jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the sceptre and\rto uphold righteousness, that you may take thought for your people\runder you; therefore it behooves you above all others both to speak\rand to give ear, and to out the counsel of another who shall have\rbeen minded to speak wisely. All turns on you and on your commands,\rtherefore I will say what I think will be best. No man will be of\ra truer mind than that which has been mine from the hour when you,\rsir, angered Achilles by taking the girl Briseis from his tent against\rmy judgment. I urged you not to do so, but you yielded to your own\rpride, and dishonoured a hero whom heaven itself had honoured- for\ryou still hold the prize that had been awarded to him. Now, however,\rlet us think how we may appease him, both with presents and fair speeches\rthat may conciliate him." \r\rAnd King Agamemnon answered, "Sir, you have reproved my folly justly.\rI was wrong. I own it. One whom heaven befriends is in himself a host,\rand Jove has shown that he befriends this man by destroying much people\rof the Achaeans. I was blinded with passion and yielded to my worser\rmind; therefore I will make amends, and will give him great gifts\rby way of atonement. I will tell them in the presence of you all.\rI will give him seven tripods that have never yet been on the fire,\rand ten talents of gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldrons and\rtwelve strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich,\rindeed, both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes as my\rhorses have won me. I will give him seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians,\rwhom I chose for myself when he took Lesbos- all of surpassing beauty.\rI will give him these, and with them her whom I erewhile took from\rhim, the daughter of Briseus; and I swear a great oath that I never\rwent up into her couch, nor have been with her after the manner of\rmen and women. \r\r"All these things will I give him now down, and if hereafter the gods\rvouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let him come when we Achaeans\rare dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold and bronze to\rhis liking; furthermore let him take twenty Trojan women, the loveliest\rafter Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest\rof all lands, he shall be my son-in-law and I will show him like honour\rwith my own dear son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance.\rI have three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and lphianassa, let\rhim take the one of his choice, freely and without gifts of wooing,\rto the house of Peleus; I will add such dower to boot as no man ever\ryet gave his daughter, and will give him seven well established cities,\rCardamyle, Enope, and Hire, where there is grass; holy Pherae and\rthe rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of\rPedasus, all near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The\rmen that dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour\rhim with gifts as though he were a god, and be obedient to his comfortable\rordinances. All this will I do if he will now forgo his anger. Let\rhim then yieldit is only Hades who is utterly ruthless and unyielding-\rand hence he is of all gods the one most hateful to mankind. Moreover\rI am older and more royal than himself. Therefore, let him now obey\rme." \r\rThen Nestor answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon.\rThe gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then send chosen messengers,\rwho may go to the tent of Achilles son of Peleus without delay. Let\rthose go whom I shall name. Let Phoenix, dear to Jove, lead the way;\rlet Ajax and Ulysses follow, and let the heralds Odius and Eurybates\rgo with them. Now bring water for our hands, and bid all keep silence\rwhile we pray to Jove the son of Saturn, if so be that he may have\rmercy upon us." \r\rThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servants\rpoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the\rmixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving\revery man his drink-offering; then, when they had made their offerings,\rand had drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys set out from\rthe tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; and Nestor, looking first to\rone and then to another, but most especially at Ulysses, was instant\rwith them that they should prevail with the noble son of Peleus.\r\rThey went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayed earnestly\rto earth-encircling Neptune that the high spirit of the son of Aeacus\rmight incline favourably towards them. When they reached the ships\rand tents of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles playing on a lyre,\rfair, of cunning workmanship, and its cross-bar was of silver. It\rwas part of the spoils which he had taken when he sacked the city\rof Eetion, and he was now diverting himself with it and singing the\rfeats of heroes. He was alone with Patroclus, who sat opposite to\rhim and said nothing, waiting till he should cease singing. Ulysses\rand Ajax now came in- Ulysses leading the way -and stood before him.\rAchilles sprang from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, and\rPatroclus, when he saw the strangers, rose also. Achilles then greeted\rthem saying, "All hail and welcome- you must come upon some great\rmatter, you, who for all my anger are still dearest to me of the Achaeans."\r\rWith this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats covered\rwith purple rugs; then he said to Patroclus who was close by him,\r"Son of Menoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water\rwith the wine, and give every man his cup, for these are very dear\rfriends, who are now under my roof." \r\rPatroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block in\rfront of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the loin\ralso of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held the meat\rwhile Achilles chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and put them\ron spits while the son of Menoetius made the fire burn high. When\rthe flame had died down, he spread the embers, laid the spits on top\rof them, lifting them up and setting them upon the spit-racks; and\rhe sprinkled them with salt. When the meat was roasted, he set it\ron platters, and handed bread round the table in fair baskets, while\rAchilles dealt them their portions. Then Achilles took his seat facing\rUlysses against the opposite wall, and bade his comrade Patroclus\roffer sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the offerings into the fire,\rand they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.\rAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Ajax made a sign\rto Phoenix, and when he saw this, Ulysses filled his cup with wine\rand pledged Achilles. \r\r"Hail," said he, "Achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer, neither\rin the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has been plenty to eat\rand drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter. Sir, we are\rin the face of great disaster, and without your help know not whether\rwe shall save our fleet or lose it. The Trojans and their allies have\rcamped hard by our ships and by the wall; they have lit watchfires\rthroughout their host and deem that nothing can now prevent them from\rfalling on our fleet. Jove, moreover, has sent his lightnings on their\rright; Hector, in all his glory, rages like a maniac; confident that\rJove is with him he fears neither god nor man, but is gone raving\rmad, and prays for the approach of day. He vows that he will hew the\rhigh sterns of our ships in pieces, set fire to their hulls, and make\rhavoc of the Achaeans while they are dazed and smothered in smoke;\rI much fear that heaven will make good his boasting, and it will prove\rour lot to perish at Troy far from our home in Argos. Up, then, and\rlate though it be, save the sons of the Achaeans who faint before\rthe fury of the Trojans. You will repent bitterly hereafter if you\rdo not, for when the harm is done there will be no curing it; consider\rere it be too late, and save the Danaans from destruction.\r\r"My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon,\rdid he not charge you saying, \'Son, Minerva and Juno will make you\rstrong if they choose, but check your high temper, for the better\rpart is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and the Achaeans old\rand young will respect you more for doing so.\' These were his words,\rbut you have forgotten them. Even now, however, be appeased, and put\raway your anger from you. Agamemnon will make you great amends if\ryou will forgive him; listen, and I will tell you what he has said\rin his tent that he will give you. He will give you seven tripods\rthat have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of gold; twenty\riron cauldrons, and twelve strong horses that have won races and carried\roff prizes. Rich indeed both in land and gold is he who has as many\rprizes as these horses have won for Agamemnon. Moreover he will give\ryou seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom he chose for himself,\rwhen you took Lesbos- all of surpassing beauty. He will give you these,\rand with them her whom he erewhile took from you, the daughter of\rBriseus, and he will swear a great oath, he has never gone up into\rher couch nor been with her after the manner of men and women. All\rthese things will he give you now down, and if hereafter the gods\rvouchsafe him to sack the city of Priam, you can come when we Achaeans\rare dividing the spoil, and load your ship with gold and bronze to\ryour liking. You can take twenty Trojan women, the loveliest after\rHelen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest of all\rlands, you shall be his son-in-law, and he will show you like honour\rwith his own dear son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance.\rAgamemnon has three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa;\ryou may take the one of your choice, freely and without gifts of wooing,\rto the house of Peleus; he will add such dower to boot as no man ever\ryet gave his daughter, and will give you seven well-established cities,\rCardamyle, Enope, and Hire where there is grass; holy Pheras and the\rrich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus,\rall near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that\rdwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour you with\rgifts as though were a god, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances.\rAll this will he do if you will now forgo your anger. Moreover, though\ryou hate both him and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the\rrest of the Achaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they\rwill honour you as a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands.\rYou might even kill Hector; he will come within your reach, for he\ris infatuated, and declares that not a Danaan whom the ships have\rbrought can hold his own against him." \r\rAchilles answered, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give you\rformal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be no\rmore of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. Him do\rI hate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while he hides\ranother in his heart; therefore I will say what I mean. I will be\rappeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of the\rDanaans, for I see that I have no thanks for all my fighting. He that\rfights fares no better than he that does not; coward and hero are\rheld in equal honour, and death deals like measure to him who works\rand him who is idle. I have taken nothing by all my hardships- with\rmy life ever in my hand; as a bird when she has found a morsel takes\rit to her nestlings, and herself fares hardly, even so man a long\rnight have I been wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by\rday against those who were fighting for their women. With my ships\rI have taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormed\rwith my men by land; I took great store of wealth from every one of\rthem, but I gave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed where\rhe was by his ships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and kept\rmuch himself. \r\r"Nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among the chieftains\rand kings, and these have them still; from me alone of the Achaeans\rdid he take the woman in whom I delighted- let him keep her and sleep\rwith her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight the Trojans? What\rmade the son of Atreus gather the host and bring them? Was it not\rfor the sake of Helen? Are the sons of Atreus the only men in the\rworld who love their wives? Any man of common right feeling will love\rand cherish her who is his own, as I this woman, with my whole heart,\rthough she was but a fruitling of my spear. Agamemnon has taken her\rfrom me; he has played me false; I know him; let him tempt me no further,\rfor he shall not move me. Let him look to you, Ulysses, and to the\rother princes to save his ships from burning. He has done much without\rme already. He has built a wall; he has dug a trench deep and wide\rall round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; but even so\rhe stays not the murderous might of Hector. So long as I fought the\rAchaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far from the city walls;\rhe would come to the Scaean gates and to the oak tree, but no further.\rOnce he stayed to meet me and hardly did he escape my onset: now,\rhowever, since I am in no mood to fight him, I will to-morrow offer\rsacrifice to Jove and to all the gods; I will draw my ships into the\rwater and then victual them duly; to-morrow morning, if you care to\rlook, you will see my ships on the Hellespont, and my men rowing out\rto sea with might and main. If great Neptune vouchsafes me a fair\rpassage, in three days I shall be in Phthia. I have much there that\rI left behind me when I came here to my sorrow, and I shall bring\rback still further store of gold, of red copper, of fair women, and\rof iron, my share of the spoils that we have taken; but one prize,\rhe who gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all as I now bid you,\rand tell him in public that the Achaeans may hate him and beware of\rhim should he think that he can yet dupe others for his effrontery\rnever fails him. \r\r"As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. I\rwill take no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in common\rwith him. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he shall not cozen\rme further; let him go his own way, for Jove has robbed him of his\rreason. I loathe his presents, and for himself care not one straw.\rHe may offer me ten or even twenty times what he has now done, nay-\rnot though it be all that he has in the world, both now or ever shall\rhave; he may promise me the wealth of Orchomenus or of Egyptian Thebes,\rwhich is the richest city in the whole world, for it has a hundred\rgates through each of which two hundred men may drive at once with\rtheir chariots and horses; he may offer me gifts as the sands of the\rsea or the dust of the plain in multitude, but even so he shall not\rmove me till I have been revenged in full for the bitter wrong he\rhas done me. I will not marry his daughter; she may be fair as Venus,\rand skilful as Minerva, but I will have none of her: let another take\rher, who may be a good match for her and who rules a larger kingdom.\rIf the gods spare me to return home, Peleus will find me a wife; there\rare Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia, daughters of kings that have\rcities under them; of these I can take whom I will and marry her.\rMany a time was I minded when at home in Phthia to woo and wed a woman\rwho would make me a suitable wife, and to enjoy the riches of my old\rfather Peleus. My life is more to me than all the wealth of Ilius\rwhile it was yet at peace before the Achaeans went there, or than\rall the treasure that lies on the stone floor of Apollo\'s temple beneath\rthe cliffs of Pytho. Cattle and sheep are to be had for harrying,\rand a man buy both tripods and horses if he wants them, but when his\rlife has once left him it can neither be bought nor harried back again.\r\r"My mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I may\rmeet my end. If I stay here and fight, I shall not return alive but\rmy name will live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will die,\rbut it will be long ere death shall take me. To the rest of you, then,\rI say, \'Go home, for you will not take Ilius.\' Jove has held his hand\rover her to protect her, and her people have taken heart. Go, therefore,\ras in duty bound, and tell the princes of the Achaeans the message\rthat I have sent them; tell them to find some other plan for the saving\rof their ships and people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the\rone that they have now hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let him\rsleep here that he may sail with me in the morning if he so will.\rBut I will not take him by force." \r\rThey all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which he\rhad denied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his great\rfear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and said, "Noble\rAchilles, if you are now minded to return, and in the fierceness of\ryour anger will do nothing to save the ships from burning, how, my\rson, can I remain here without you? Your father Peleus bade me go\rwith you when he sent you as a mere lad from Phthia to Agamemnon.\rYou knew nothing neither of war nor of the arts whereby men make their\rmark in council, and he sent me with you to train you in all excellence\rof speech and action. Therefore, my son, I will not stay here without\ryou- no, not though heaven itself vouchsafe to strip my years from\roff me, and make me young as I was when I first left Hellas the land\rof fair women. I was then flying the anger of father Amyntor, son\rof Ormenus, who was furious with me in the matter of his concubine,\rof whom he was enamoured to the wronging of his wife my mother. My\rmother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing to lie with the woman\rmyself, that so she hate my father, and in the course of time I yielded.\rBut my father soon came to know, and cursed me bitterly, calling the\rdread Erinyes to witness. He prayed that no son of mine might ever\rsit upon knees- and the gods, Jove of the world below and awful Proserpine,\rfulfilled his curse. I took counsel to kill him, but some god stayed\rmy rashness and bade me think on men\'s evil tongues and how I should\rbe branded as the murderer of my father: nevertheless I could not\rbear to stay in my father\'s house with him so bitter a against me.\rMy cousins and clansmen came about me, and pressed me sorely to remain;\rmany a sheep and many an ox did they slaughter, and many a fat hog\rdid they set down to roast before the fire; many a jar, too, did they\rbroach of my father\'s wine. Nine whole nights did they set a guard\rover me taking it in turns to watch, and they kept a fire always burning,\rboth in the cloister of the outer court and in the inner court at\rthe doors of the room wherein I lay; but when the darkness of the\rtenth night came, I broke through the closed doors of my room, and\rclimbed the wall of the outer court after passing quickly and unperceived\rthrough the men on guard and the women servants. I then fled through\rHellas till I came to fertile Phthia, mother of sheep, and to King\rPeleus, who made me welcome and treated me as a father treats an only\rson who will be heir to all his wealth. He made me rich and set me\rover much people, establishing me on the borders of Phthia where I\rwas chief ruler over the Dolopians. \r\r"It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with all\rmy heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had gone\rout elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut up the\rdainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup to your\rlips. Many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby helplessness\rover my shirt; I had infinite trouble with you, but I knew that heaven\rhad vouchsafed me no offspring of my own, and I made a son of you,\rAchilles, that in my hour of need you might protect me. Now, therefore,\rI say battle with your pride and beat it; cherish not your anger for\rever; the might and majesty of heaven are more than ours, but even\rheaven may be appeased; and if a man has sinned he prays the gods,\rand reconciles them to himself by his piteous cries and by frankincense,\rwith drink-offerings and the savour of burnt sacrifice. For prayers\rare as daughters to great Jove; halt, wrinkled, with eyes askance,\rthey follow in the footsteps of sin, who, being fierce and fleet of\rfoot, leaves them far behind him, and ever baneful to mankind outstrips\rthem even to the ends of the world; but nevertheless the prayers come\rhobbling and healing after. If a man has pity upon these daughters\rof Jove when they draw near him, they will bless him and hear him\rtoo when he is praying; but if he deny them and will not listen to\rthem, they go to Jove the son of Saturn and pray that he may presently\rfall into sin- to his ruing bitterly hereafter. Therefore, Achilles,\rgive these daughters of Jove due reverence, and bow before them as\rall good men will bow. Were not the son of Atreus offering you gifts\rand promising others later- if he were still furious and implacable-\rI am not he that would bid you throw off your anger and help the Achaeans,\rno matter how great their need; but he is giving much now, and more\rhereafter; he has sent his captains to urge his suit, and has chosen\rthose who of all the Argives are most acceptable to you; make not\rthen their words and their coming to be of none effect. Your anger\rhas been righteous so far. We have heard in song how heroes of old\rtime quarrelled when they were roused to fury, but still they could\rbe won by gifts, and fair words could soothe them. \r\r"I have an old story in my mind- a very old one- but you are all friends\rand I will tell it. The Curetes and the Aetolians were fighting and\rkilling one another round Calydon- the Aetolians defending the city\rand the Curetes trying to destroy it. For Diana of the golden throne\rwas angry and did them hurt because Oeneus had not offered her his\rharvest first-fruits. The other gods had all been feasted with hecatombs,\rbut to the daughter of great Jove alone he had made no sacrifice.\rHe had forgotten her, or somehow or other it had escaped him, and\rthis was a grievous sin. Thereon the archer goddess in her displeasure\rsent a prodigious creature against him- a savage wild boar with great\rwhite tusks that did much harm to his orchard lands, uprooting apple-trees\rin full bloom and throwing them to the ground. But Meleager son of\rOeneus got huntsmen and hounds from many cities and killed it- for\rit was so monstrous that not a few were needed, and many a man did\rit stretch upon his funeral pyre. On this the goddess set the Curetes\rand the Aetolians fighting furiously about the head and skin of the\rboar. \r\r"So long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with the Curetes,\rand for all their numbers they could not hold their ground under the\rcity walls; but in the course of time Meleager was angered as even\ra wise man will sometimes be. He was incensed with his mother Althaea,\rand therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife fair Cleopatra,\rwho was daughter of Marpessa daughter of Euenus, and of Ides the man\rthen living. He it was who took his bow and faced King Apollo himself\rfor fair Marpessa\'s sake; her father and mother then named her Alcyone,\rbecause her mother had mourned with the plaintive strains of the halcyon-bird\rwhen Phoebus Apollo had carried her off. Meleager, then, stayed at\rhome with Cleopatra, nursing the anger which he felt by reason of\rhis mother\'s curses. His mother, grieving for the death of her brother,\rprayed the gods, and beat the earth with her hands, calling upon Hades\rand on awful Proserpine; she went down upon her knees and her bosom\rwas wet with tears as she prayed that they would kill her son- and\rErinys that walks in darkness and knows no ruth heard her from Erebus.\r\r"Then was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, and\rthe dull thump of the battering against their walls. Thereon the elders\rof the Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest of their\rpriests, and begged him to come out and help them, promising him a\rgreat reward. They bade him choose fifty plough-gates, the most fertile\rin the plain of Calydon, the one-half vineyard and the other open\rplough-land. The old warrior Oeneus implored him, standing at the\rthreshold of his room and beating the doors in supplication. His sisters\rand his mother herself besought him sore, but he the more refused\rthem; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest to him also\rprayed him, but they could not move him till the foe was battering\rat the very doors of his chamber, and the Curetes had scaled the walls\rand were setting fire to the city. Then at last his sorrowing wife\rdetailed the horrors that befall those whose city is taken; she reminded\rhim how the men are slain, and the city is given over to the flames,\rwhile the women and children are carried into captivity; when he heard\rall this, his heart was touched, and he donned his armour to go forth.\rThus of his own inward motion he saved the city of the Aetolians;\rbut they now gave him nothing of those rich rewards that they had\roffered earlier, and though he saved the city he took nothing by it.\rBe not then, my son, thus minded; let not heaven lure you into any\rsuch course. When the ships are burning it will be a harder matter\rto save them. Take the gifts, and go, for the Achaeans will then honour\ryou as a god; whereas if you fight without taking them, you may beat\rthe battle back, but you will not be held in like honour."\r\rAnd Achilles answered, "Phoenix, old friend and father, I have no\rneed of such honour. I have honour from Jove himself, which will abide\rwith me at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my limbs are\rstrong. I say further- and lay my saying to your heart- vex me no\rmore with this weeping and lamentation, all in the cause of the son\rof Atreus. Love him so well, and you may lose the love I bear you.\rYou ought to help me rather in troubling those that trouble me; be\rking as much as I am, and share like honour with myself; the others\rshall take my answer; stay here yourself and sleep comfortably in\ryour bed; at daybreak we will consider whether to remain or go."\r\rOn this she nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was to prepare\ra bed for Phoenix, and that the others should take their leave. Ajax\rson of Telamon then said, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, let us be\rgone, for I see that our journey is vain. We must now take our answer,\runwelcome though it be, to the Danaans who are waiting to receive\rit. Achilles is savage and remorseless; he is cruel, and cares nothing\rfor the love his comrades lavished upon him more than on all the others.\rHe is implacable- and yet if a man\'s brother or son has been slain\rhe will accept a fine by way of amends from him that killed him, and\rthe wrong-doer having paid in full remains in peace among his own\rpeople; but as for you, Achilles, the gods have put a wicked unforgiving\rspirit in your heart, and this, all about one single girl, whereas\rwe now offer you the seven best we have, and much else into the bargain.\rBe then of a more gracious mind, respect the hospitality of your own\rroof. We are with you as messengers from the host of the Danaans,\rand would fain he held nearest and dearest to yourself of all the\rAchaeans." \r\r"Ajax," replied Achilles, "noble son of Telamon, you have spoken much\rto my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over, and remember\rhow the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as though I were some\rvile tramp, and that too in the presence of the Argives. Go, then,\rand deliver your message; say that I will have no concern with fighting\rtill Hector, son of noble Priam, reaches the tents of the Myrmidons\rin his murderous course, and flings fire upon their ships. For all\rhis lust of battle, I take it he will be held in check when he is\rat my own tent and ship." \r\rOn this they took every man his double cup, made their drink-offerings,\rand went back to the ships, Ulysses leading the way. But Patroclus\rtold his men and the maid-servants to make ready a comfortable bed\rfor Phoenix; they therefore did so with sheepskins, a rug, and a sheet\rof fine linen. The old man then laid himself down and waited till\rmorning came. But Achilles slept in an inner room, and beside him\rthe daughter of Phorbas lovely Diomede, whom he had carried off from\rLesbos. Patroclus lay on the other side of the room, and with him\rfair Iphis whom Achilles had given him when he took Scyros the city\rof Enyeus. \r\rWhen the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the Achaeans\rrose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to question them. King\rAgamemnon was the first to do so. Tell me, Ulysses," said he, "will\rhe save the ships from burning, or did be refuse, and is he still\rfurious?" \r\rUlysses answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\rAchilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely angry than ever,\rand spurns both you and your gifts. He bids you take counsel with\rthe Achaeans to save the ships and host as you best may; as for himself,\rhe said that at daybreak he should draw his ships into the water.\rHe said further that he should advise every one to sail home likewise,\rfor that you will not reach the goal of Ilius. \'Jove,\' he said, \'has\rlaid his hand over the city to protect it, and the people have taken\rheart.\' This is what he said, and the others who were with me can\rtell you the same story- Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them,\rwho may be trusted. The old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep,\rfor so Achilles would have it, that he might go home with him in the\rmorning if he so would; but he will not take him by force."\r\rThey all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and dejected,\rby reason of the sternness with which Achilles had refused them, till\rpresently Diomed said, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\ryou ought not to have sued the son of Peleus nor offered him gifts.\rHe is proud enough as it is, and you have encouraged him in his pride\ram further. Let him stay or go as he will. He will fight later when\rhe is in the humour, and heaven puts it in his mind to do so. Now,\rtherefore, let us all do as I say; we have eaten and drunk our fill,\rlet us then take our rest, for in rest there is both strength and\rstay. But when fair rosy-fingered morn appears, forthwith bring out\ryour host and your horsemen in front of the ships, urging them on,\rand yourself fighting among the foremost." \r\rThus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. They then\rmade their drink-offerings and went every man to his own tent, where\rthey laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK X\r\rNow the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole night\rthrough, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that he could\rget no rest. As when fair Juno\'s lord flashes his lightning in token\rof great rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground,\ror again as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry war,\reven so did Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled\rwithin him. When he looked upon the plain of Troy he marvelled at\rthe many watchfires burning in front of Ilius, and at the sound of\rpipes and flutes and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned\rtowards the ships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hair by handfuls\rbefore Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness of\rhis soul. In the end he deemed it best to go at once to Nestor son\rof Neleus, and see if between them they could find any way of the\rAchaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on his shirt, bound\rhis sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawny\rlion over his shoulders- a skin that reached his feet- and took his\rspear in his hand. \r\rNeither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argives\rwho for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight the Trojans.\rHe covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther, put\ra casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawny\rhand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most powerful\rof the Achaeans, and was honoured by the people as though he were\ra god. He found him by the stern of his ship already putting his goodly\rarray about his shoulders, and right glad was he that his brother\rhad come. \r\rMenelaus spoke first. "Why," said he, "my dear brother, are you thus\rarming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit the Trojans?\rI greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and spy upon\rthe enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed of great daring."\r\rAnd King Agamemnon answered, "Menelaus, we both of us need shrewd\rcounsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed his\rmind, and inclines towards Hector\'s sacrifices rather than ours. I\rnever saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in\rone day as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans-\rand that too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god\rnor goddess. The Argives will rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore,\rwith all speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus.\rMeanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him rise and go about among\rthe companies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; they\rwill listen to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, and Meriones\rbrother in arms to Idomeneus, are captains over them. It was to them\rmore particularly that we gave this charge." \r\rMenelaus replied, "How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with them\rand wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have given\ryour orders?" "Wait," answered King Agamemnon, "for there are so many\rpaths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call every man\ron your way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage and\rby his father\'s name, give each all titular observance, and stand\rnot too much upon your own dignity; we must take our full share of\rtoil, for at our birth Jove laid this heavy burden upon us."\r\rWith these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went on\rto Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his tent\rhard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him- his shield,\rhis two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdle\rwith which the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his people\rinto battle- for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his\relbow and looked up at Agamemnon. "Who is it," said he, "that goes\rthus about the host and the ships alone and in the dead of night,\rwhen men are sleeping? Are you looking for one of your mules or for\rsome comrade? Do not stand there and say nothing, but speak. What\ris your business?" \r\rAnd Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\rname, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove has laid labour\rand sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and my limbs carry\rme. I am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my eyelids, but my\rheart is big with war and with the jeopardy of the Achaeans. I am\rin great fear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and without sure counsel;\rmy heart beats as though it would leap out of my body, and my limbs\rfail me. If then you can do anything- for you too cannot sleep- let\rus go the round of the watch, and see whether they are drowsy with\rtoil and sleeping to the neglect of their duty. The enemy is encamped\rhard and we know not but he may attack us by night." \r\rNestor replied, "Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\rJove will not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he will; he will\rhave troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger.\rI will go with you, and we will rouse others, either the son of Tydeus,\ror Ulysses, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Some one\rhad also better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for their ships\rare not near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot however refrain\rfrom blaming Menelaus, much as I love him and respect him- and I will\rsay so plainly, even at the risk of offending you- for sleeping and\rleaving all this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going about imploring\raid from all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are in extreme danger."\r\rAnd Agamemnon answered, "Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly,\rfor he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself- not indeed\rfrom sloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects\rme to take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before\rI was, and came to me of his own accord. I have already sent him to\rcall the very men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We\rshall find them with the watch outside the gates, for it was there\rI said that we would meet them." \r\r"In that case," answered Nestor, "the Argives will not blame him nor\rdisobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives them instructions."\r\rWith this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his comely\rfeet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large, and\rof a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear,\rand wended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. First he called\rloudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for he was\rsoon roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside his tent\rand said, "Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along the\rline of the ships in the stillness of the night? What is it that you\rfind so urgent?" And Nestor knight of Gerene answered, "Ulysses, noble\rson of Laertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great straits.\rCome with me and let us wake some other, who may advise well with\rus whether we shall fight or fly." \r\rOn this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about his\rshoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed son of\rTydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with his\rcomrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as\rfor their spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts\rthat were driven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed\rafar like the lightning of father Jove. The hero was sleeping upon\rthe skin of an ox, with a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor\rwent up to him and stirred him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding\rhim and urging him to bestir himself. "Wake up," he exclaimed, "son\rof Tydeus. How can you sleep on in this way? Can you not see that\rthe Trojans are encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships,\rwith but a little space between us and them?" \r\rOn these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, "Old man, your\rheart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. Are there\rno younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the\rprinces? There is no tiring you." \r\rAnd Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, "My son, all that you have\rsaid is true. I have good sons, and also much people who might call\rthe chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and\rdeath are balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Go then, for\ryou are younger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax and the fleet\rson of Phyleus." \r\rDiomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders- a\rskin that reached his feet- and grasped his spear. When he had roused\rthe heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went the round\rof those who were on guard, and found the captains not sleeping at\rtheir posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms about them. As\rsheep dogs that watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear\ra wild beast coming through the mountain forest towards them- forthwith\rthere is a hue and cry of dogs and men, and slumber is broken- even\rso was sleep chased from the eyes of the Achaeans as they kept the\rwatches of the wicked night, for they turned constantly towards the\rplain whenever they heard any stir among the Trojans. The old man\rwas glad bade them be of good cheer. "Watch on, my children," said\rhe, "and let not sleep get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph\rover us." \r\rWith this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of the\rAchaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the brave\rson of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they were\rbeyond the trench that was dug round the wall they held their meeting\ron the open ground where there was a space clear of corpses, for it\rwas here that when night fell Hector had turned back from his onslaught\ron the Argives. They sat down, therefore, and held debate with one\ranother. \r\rNestor spoke first. "My friends," said he, "is there any man bold\renough to venture the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or us news\rof what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here by the ships\raway from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted the Achaeans,\rthey will retire within their walls. If he could learn all this and\rcome back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven in the mouths\rof all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs from all\rour ships would each of them give him a black ewe with her lamb- which\ris a present of surpassing value- and he would be asked as a guest\rto all feasts and clan-gatherings." \r\rThey all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke saying,\r"Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans over against\rus, but if another will go with me I shall do so in greater confidence\rand comfort. When two men are together, one of them may see some opportunity\rwhich the other has not caught sight of; if a man is alone he is less\rfull of resource, and his wit is weaker." \r\rOn this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes, servants\rof Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so did\rMenelaus son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the host of\rthe Trojans, for he was ever full of daring, and thereon Agamemnon\rking of men spoke thus: "Diomed," said he, "son of Tydeus, man after\rmy own heart, choose your comrade for yourself- take the best man\rof those that have offered, for many would now go with you. Do not\rthrough delicacy reject the better man, and take the worst out of\rrespect for his lineage, because he is of more royal blood."\r\rHe said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, "If\ryou bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I fail\rto think of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to face\rall kinds of danger- and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he were\rto go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is\rquick to see and understand." \r\r"Son of Tydeus," replied Ulysses, "say neither good nor ill about\rme, for you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going, for\rthe night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward,\rtwo-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone\rleft us." \r\rThey then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son\rof Tydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his\rship) and on his head he set a helmet of bull\'s hide without either\rpeak or crest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear.\rMeriones found a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he set\ra leathern helmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathern\rthongs, while on the outside it was thickly studded with boar\'s teeth,\rwell and skilfully set into it; next the head there was an inner lining\rof felt. This helmet had been stolen by Autolycus out of Eleon when\rhe broke into the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus. He gave it to Amphidamas\rof Cythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift\rto Molus, who gave it to his son Meriones; and now it was set upon\rthe head of Ulysses. \r\rWhen the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftains\rbehind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upon\rtheir right hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but they\rheard its cry. Ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed to Minerva:\r"Hear me," he cried, "daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you who spy\rout all my ways and who are with me in all my hardships; befriend\rme in this mine hour, and grant that we may return to the ships covered\rwith glory after having achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring\rsorrow to the Trojans." \r\rThen Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: "Hear me too," said he,\r"daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with my\rnoble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by the Achaeans.\rHe left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus, and went to\rthe city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians; on his return\rthence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds of daring, for\ryou were his ready helper. Even so guide me and guard me now, and\rin return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a\ryear old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I\rwill gild her horns and will offer her up to you in sacrifice."\r\rThus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When they\rhad done praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went their way\rlike two lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stained\rbodies of them that had fallen. \r\rNeither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called\rthe princes and councillors of the Trojans that he might set his counsel\rbefore them. "Is there one," said he, "who for a great reward will\rdo me the service of which I will tell you? He shall be well paid\rif he will. I will give him a chariot and a couple of horses, the\rfleetest that can be found at the ships of the Achaeans, if he will\rdare this thing; and he will win infinite honour to boot; he must\rgo to the ships and find out whether they are still guarded as heretofore,\ror whether now that we have beaten them the Achaeans design to fly,\rand through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their watches."\r\rThey all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certain\rman named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald- a man rich in\rgold and bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an\ronly son among five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans.\r"I, Hector," said he, "Will to the ships and will exploit them. But\rfirst hold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me the chariot,\rbedight with bronze, and the horses that now carry the noble son of\rPeleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not fail you. I will\rgo through the host from one end to the other till I come to the ship\rof Agamemnon, where I take it the princes of the Achaeans are now\rconsulting whether they shall fight or fly." \r\rWhen he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore him\rhis oath saying, "May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bear witness\rthat no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds, and that\ryou shall have your will with them for ever." \r\rThe oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on going.\rHe hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he wore the skin\rof a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferret skin. Then\rhe took a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships, but he\rwas not to return with any news for Hector. When he had left the horses\rand the troops behind him, he made all speed on his way, but Ulysses\rperceived his coming and said to Diomed, "Diomed, here is some one\rfrom the camp; I am not sure whether he is a spy, or whether it is\rsome thief who would plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a\rlittle past us, we can then spring upon him and take him. If, however,\rhe is too quick for us, go after him with your spear and hem him in\rtowards the ships away from the Trojan camp, to prevent his getting\rback to the town." \r\rWith this they turned out of their way and lay down among the corpses.\rDolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he had got\rabout as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds\rone that has been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land\rquicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when he heard their footsteps\rhe stood still, for he made sure they were friends from the Trojan\rcamp come by Hector\'s orders to bid him return; when, however, they\rwere only a spear\'s cast, or less away form him, he saw that they\rwere enemies as fast as his legs could take him. The others gave chase\rat once, and as a couple of well-trained hounds press forward after\ra doe or hare that runs screaming in front of them, even so did the\rson of Tydeus and Ulysses pursue Dolon and cut him off from his own\rpeople. But when he had fled so far towards the ships that he would\rsoon have fallen in with the outposts, Minerva infused fresh strength\rinto the son of Tydeus for fear some other of the Achaeans might have\rthe glory of being first to hit him, and he might himself be only\rsecond; he therefore sprang forward with his spear and said, "Stand,\ror I shall throw my spear, and in that case I shall soon make an end\rof you." \r\rHe threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flew\rover the man\'s right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. He stood\rstock still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered, and\rhe turned pale with fear. The two came breathless up to him and seized\rhis hands, whereon he began to weep and said, "Take me alive; I will\rransom myself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron,\rand from this my father will satisfy you with a very large ransom,\rshould he hear of my being alive at the ships of the Achaeans."\r\r"Fear not," replied Ulysses, "let no thought of death be in your mind;\rbut tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about alone\rin the dead of night away from your camp and towards the ships, while\rother men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies of the slain,\ror did Hector send you to spy out what was going on at the ships?\rOr did you come here of your own mere notion?" \r\rDolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: "Hector, with his\rvain flattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. He said\rhe would give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and his bronze-bedizened\rchariot; he bade me go through the darkness of the flying night, get\rclose to the enemy, and find out whether the ships are still guarded\ras heretofore, or whether, now that we have beaten them, the Achaeans\rdesign to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep\rtheir watches." \r\rUlysses smiled at him and answered, "You had indeed set your heart\rupon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus are\rhardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than Achilles\rhimself, whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, and tell me true,\rwhere did you leave Hector when you started? Where lies his armour\rand his horses? How, too, are the watches and sleeping-ground of the\rTrojans ordered? What are their plans? Will they stay here by the\rships and away from the city, or now that they have worsted the Achaeans,\rwill they retire within their walls?" \r\rAnd Dolon answered, "I will tell you truly all. Hector and the other\rcouncillors are now holding conference by the monument of great Ilus,\raway from the general tumult; as for the guards about which you ask\rme, there is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host. The Trojans\rhave their watchfires, for they are bound to have them; they, therefore,\rare awake and keep each other to their duty as sentinels; but the\rallies who have come from other places are asleep and leave it to\rthe Trojans to keep guard, for their wives and children are not here."\r\rUlysses then said, "Now tell me; are they sleeping among the Trojan\rtroops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may understand it."\r\r"I will tell you truly all," replied Dolon. "To the seaward lie the\rCarians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians, and the\rnoble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians and\rMeonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask\rabout an this? If you want to find your way into the host of the Trojans,\rthere are the Thracians, who have lately come here and lie apart from\rthe others at the far end of the camp; and they have Rhesus son of\rEioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and strongest that\rI have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than any wind\rthat blows. His chariot is bedight with silver and gold, and he has\rbrought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarest workmanship- too\rsplendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet only for the gods.\rNow, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securely here, until\ryou come back and have proved my words whether they be false or true."\r\rDiomed looked sternly at him and answered, "Think not, Dolon, for\rall the good information you have given us, that you shall escape\rnow you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you\rwill come some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as\ra spy or as an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you\rwill give no more trouble." \r\rOn this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him further,\rbut Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his sword and\rcut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the dust\rwhile he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his\rhead, and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysses\rhung them up aloft in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, and\rprayed saying, "Accept these, goddess, for we give them to you in\rpreference to all the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us still further\rtowards the horses and sleeping-ground of the Thracians."\r\rWith these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk tree,\rand they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering boughs\rof tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through\rthe\' flying hours of darkness. The two then went onwards amid the\rfallen armour and the blood, and came presently to the company of\rThracian soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with their day\'s toil;\rtheir goodly armour was lying on the ground beside them all orderly\rin three rows, and each man had his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus\rwas sleeping in the middle, and hard by him his horses were made fast\rto the topmost rim of his chariot. Ulysses from some way off saw him\rand said, "This, Diomed, is the man, and these are the horses about\rwhich Dolon whom we killed told us. Do your very utmost; dally not\rabout your armour, but loose the horses at once- or else kill the\rmen yourself, while I see to the horses." \r\rThereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smote\rthem right and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were being\rhacked about, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion springs\rfuriously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds without their\rshepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thracian soldiers\rtill he had killed twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came and drew\rthem aside by their feet one by one, that the horses might go forward\rfreely without being frightened as they passed over the dead bodies,\rfor they were not yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus came to\rthe king, he killed him too (which made thirteen), as he was breathing\rhard, for by the counsel of Minerva an evil dream, the seed of Oeneus,\rhovered that night over his head. Meanwhile Ulysses untied the horses,\rmade them fast one to another and drove them off, striking them with\rhis bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. Then\rhe whistled as a sign to Diomed. \r\rBut Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed he\rmight accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in which\rthe king\'s armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to lift\rthe armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not kill\rsome more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came up\rto him and said, "Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may be driven\rthither, should some other god rouse the Trojans." \r\rDiomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the horses.\rUlysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to the ships of\rthe Achaeans. \r\rBut Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the son\rof Tydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of the Trojans\rhe roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noble kinsman\rof Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that the horses\rwere no longer in their place, and that the men were gasping in their\rdeath-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend\rby name. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as the people\rkept hurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds of the heroes\rwho had now got away towards the ships. \r\rWhen they reached the place where they had killed Hector\'s scout,\rUlysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the ground,\rplaced the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses and remounted:\rthen he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forward nothing loth\rtowards the ships as though of their own free will. Nestor was first\rto hear the tramp of their feet. "My friends," said he, "princes and\rcounsellors of the Argives, shall I guess right or wrong?- but I must\rsay what I think: there is a sound in my ears as of the tramp of horses.\rI hope it may Diomed and Ulysses driving in horses from the Trojans,\rbut I much fear that the bravest of the Argives may have come to some\rharm at their hands." \r\rHe had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted,\rwhereon the others shook hands right gladly with them and congratulated\rthem. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to question them. "Tell me,"\rsaid he, "renowned Ulysses, how did you two come by these horses?\rDid you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some god meet you\rand give them to you? They are like sunbeams. I am well conversant\rwith the Trojans, for old warrior though I am I never hold back by\rthe ships, but I never yet saw or heard of such horses as these are.\rSurely some god must have met you and given them to you, for you are\rboth of dear to Jove, and to Jove\'s daughter Minerva." \r\rAnd Ulysses answered, "Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\rname, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses than these,\rfor the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses, however,\rabout which you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace. Diomed killed\rtheir king with the twelve bravest of his companions. Hard by the\rships we took a thirteenth man- a scout whom Hector and the other\rTrojans had sent as a spy upon our ships." \r\rHe laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while\rthe other Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the strongly\rbuilt quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with thongs\rof leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stood eating\rtheir sweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils of Dolon\rat the stern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering\rto Minerva. As for themselves, they went into the sea and washed the\rsweat from their bodies, and from their necks and thighs. When the\rsea-water had taken all the sweat from off them, and had refreshed\rthem, they went into the baths and washed themselves. After they had\rso done and had anointed themselves with oil, they sat down to table,\rand drawing from a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering of wine\rto Minerva. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XI\r\rAnd now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of\rlight alike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord with\rthe ensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans. She took\rher stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses\' ship which was middlemost\rof all, so that her voice might carry farthest on either side, on\rthe one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the\rother towards those of Achilles- for these two heroes, well-assured\rof their own strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the\rtwo ends of the line. There she took her stand, and raised a cry both\rloud and shrill that filled the Achaeans with courage, giving them\rheart to fight resolutely and with all their might, so that they had\rrather stay there and do battle than go home in their ships.\r\rThe son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselves\rfor battle while he put on his armour. First he girded his goodly\rgreaves about his legs, making them fast with ankle clasps of silver;\rand about his chest he set the breastplate which Cinyras had once\rgiven him as a guest-gift. It had been noised abroad as far as Cyprus\rthat the Achaeans were about to sail for Troy, and therefore he gave\rit to the king. It had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve of gold,\rand ten of tin. There were serpents of cyanus that reared themselves\rup towards the neck, three upon either side, like the rainbows which\rthe son of Saturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortal men. About\rhis shoulders he threw his sword, studded with bosses of gold; and\rthe scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith to hang\rit. He took moreover the richly-dight shield that covered his body\rwhen he was in battle- fair to see, with ten circles of bronze running\rall round see, wit it. On the body of the shield there were twenty\rbosses of white tin, with another of dark cyanus in the middle: this\rlast was made to show a Gorgon\'s head, fierce and grim, with Rout\rand Panic on either side. The band for the arm to go through was of\rsilver, on which there was a writhing snake of cyanus with three heads\rthat sprang from a single neck, and went in and out among one another.\rOn his head Agamemnon set a helmet, with a peak before and behind,\rand four plumes of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it; then\rhe grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his\rarmour shot from him as a flame into the firmament, while Juno and\rMinerva thundered in honour of the king of rich Mycene. \r\rEvery man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold\rthem in readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on foot\rclad in full armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into the dawning.\rThe chiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses got there,\rbut these came up presently. The son of Saturn sent a portent of evil\rsound about their host, and the dew fell red with blood, for he was\rabout to send many a brave man hurrying down to Hades. \r\rThe Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain,\rwere gathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas who was\rhonoured by the Trojans like an immortal, and the three sons of Antenor,\rPolybus, Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a god. Hector\'s round\rshield showed in the front rank, and as some baneful star that shines\rfor a moment through a rent in the clouds and is again hidden beneath\rthem; even so was Hector now seen in the front ranks and now again\rin the hindermost, and his bronze armour gleamed like the lightning\rof aegis-bearing Jove. \r\rAnd now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon a\rrich man\'s land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even so did\rthe Trojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no mood\rfor yielding but fought like wolves, and neither side got the better\rof the other. Discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was the\ronly god that went among them; the others were not there, but stayed\rquietly each in his own home among the dells and valleys of Olympus.\rAll of them blamed the son of Saturn for wanting to Live victory to\rthe Trojans, but father Jove heeded them not: he held aloof from all,\rand sat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon the city\rof the Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam of bronze, and\ralike upon the slayers and on the slain. \r\rNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their darts\rrained thick on one another and the people perished, but as the hour\rdrew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will get\rhis midday meal- for he has felled till his hands are weary; he is\rtired out, and must now have food- then the Danaans with a cry that\rrang through all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy. Agamemnon\rled them on, and slew first Bienor, a leader of his people, and afterwards\rhis comrade and charioteer Oileus, who sprang from his chariot and\rwas coming full towards him; but Agamemnon struck him on the forehead\rwith his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail against the weapon,\rwhich pierced both bronze and bone, so that his brains were battered\rin and he was killed in full fight. \r\rAgamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with their\rbreasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went on to\rkill Isus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, the other\rborn in wedlock; they were in the same chariot- the bastard driving,\rwhile noble Antiphus fought beside him. Achilles had once taken both\rof them prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound them with fresh\rwithes as they were shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them;\rnow, however, Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus in the chest above\rthe nipple with his spear, while he struck Antiphus hard by the ear\rand threw him from his chariot. Forthwith he stripped their goodly\rarmour from off them and recognized them, for he had already seen\rthem at ships when Achilles brought them in from Ida. As a lion fastens\ron the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great jaws, robbing\rthem of their tender life while he on his way back to his lair- the\rhind can do nothing for them even though she be close by, for she\ris in an agony of fear, and flies through the thick forest, sweating,\rand at her utmost speed before the mighty monster- so, no man of the\rTrojans could help Isus and Antiphus, for they were themselves flying\rpanic before the Argives. \r\rThen King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and\rbrave Hippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost in preventing\rHelen\'s being restored to Menelaus, for he was largely bribed by Alexandrus;\rand now Agamemnon took his two sons, both in the same chariot, trying\rto bring their horses to a stand- for they had lost hold of the reins\rand the horses were mad with fear. The son of Atreus sprang upon them\rlike a lion, and the pair besought him from their chariot. "Take us\ralive," they cried, "son of Atreus, and you shall receive a great\rransom for us. Our father Antimachus has great store of gold, bronze,\rand wrought iron, and from this he will satisfy you with a very large\rransom should he hear of our being alive at the ships of the Achaeans."\r\rWith such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but they\rheard no pitiful answer in return. "If," said Agamemnon, "you are\rsons of Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans proposed that\rMenelaus and Ulysses, who had come to you as envoys, should be killed\rand not suffered to return, you shall now pay for the foul iniquity\rof your father." \r\rAs he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth, smiting\rhim on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermost upon\rthe ground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; he\rcut off his hands and his head- which he sent rolling in among the\rcrowd as though it were a ball. There he let them both lie, and wherever\rthe ranks were thickest thither he flew, while the other Achaeans\rfollowed. Foot soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe in rout\rbefore them, and slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen, and\rthe thundering tramp of the horses raised a cloud of dust frim off\rthe plain. King Agamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and cheering\ron the Achaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze- the eddying\rgusts whirl fire in all directions till the thickets shrivel and are\rconsumed before the blast of the flame- even so fell the heads of\rthe flying Trojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, and many a noble\rpair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highways of war, for\rlack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more useful now to vultures\rthan to their wives. \r\rJove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage and\rdin of battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling out lustily\rto the Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus, son of Dardanus,\rin the middle of the plain, and past the place of the wild fig-tree\rmaking always for the city- the son of Atreus still shouting, and\rwith hands all bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached the Scaean\rgates and the oak tree, there they halted and waited for the others\rto come up. Meanwhile the Trojans kept on flying over the middle of\rthe plain like a herd cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked\rthem in the dead of night- he springs on one of them, seizes her neck\rin the grip of his strong teeth and then laps up her blood and gorges\rhimself upon her entrails- even so did King Agamemnon son of Atreus\rpursue the foe, ever slaughtering the hindmost as they fled pell-mell\rbefore him. Many a man was flung headlong from his chariot by the\rhand of the son of Atreus, for he wielded his spear with fury.\r\rBut when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city, the\rfather of gods and men came down from heaven and took his seat, thunderbolt\rin hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida. He then told Iris\rof the golden wings to carry a message for him. "Go," said he, "fleet\rIris, and speak thus to Hector- say that so long as he sees Agamemnon\rheading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, he is to keep\raloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon\ris wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then\rwill I vouchsafe him strength to slay till he reach the ships and\rnight falls at the going down of the sun." \r\rIris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from the\rcrests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his chariot\rand horses. Then she said, "Hector son of Priam, peer of gods in counsel,\rfather Jove has sent me to bear you this message- so long as you see\rAgamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, you\rare to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle,\rbut when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes\rto his chariot, then will Jove vouchsafe you strength to slay till\ryou reach the ships, and till night falls at the going down of the\rsun." \r\rWhen she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full armed\rfrom his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he went about\reverywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, and stirring\rthe dread strife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round, and again\rmet the Achaeans, while the Argives on their part strengthened their\rbattalions. The battle was now in array and they stood face to face\rwith one another, Agamemnon ever pressing forward in his eagerness\rto be ahead of all others. \r\rTell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who, whether\rof the Trojans or of their allies, was first to face Agamemnon? It\rwas Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and of great stature,\rwho was brought up in fertile Thrace the mother of sheep. Cisses,\rhis mother\'s father, brought him up in his own house when he was a\rchild- Cisses, father to fair Theano. When he reached manhood, Cisses\rwould have kept him there, and was for giving him his daughter in\rmarriage, but as soon as he had married he set out to fight the Achaeans\rwith twelve ships that followed him: these he had left at Percote\rand had come on by land to Ilius. He it was that naw met Agamemnon\rson of Atreus. When they were close up with one another, the son of\rAtreus missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him on the girdle below the\rcuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting to his strength\rof arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor nearly so, for the\rpoint of the spear struck against the silver and was turned aside\ras though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught it from his hand,\rand drew it towards him with the fury of a lion; he then drew his\rsword, and killed Iphidamas by striking him on the neck. So there\rthe poor fellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were of bronze, killed\rin the defence of his fellow-citizens, far from his wedded wife, of\rwhom he had had no joy though he had given much for her: he had given\ra hundred-head of cattle down, and had promised later on to give a\rthousand sheep and goats mixed, from the countless flocks of which\rhe was possessed. Agamemnon son of Atreus then despoiled him, and\rcarried off his armour into the host of the Achaeans. \r\rWhen noble Coon, Antenor\'s eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were\rhis eyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon he\rgot beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of his\rarm below the elbow, the point of the spear going right through the\rarm. Agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not even for this\rdid he leave off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear that\rflew as fleet as the wind, and sprang upon Coon who was trying to\rdrag off the body of his brother- his father\'s son- by the foot, and\rwas crying for help to all the bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnon\rstruck him with a bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was dragging\rthe dead body through the press of men under cover of his shield:\rhe then cut off his head, standing over the body of Iphidamas. Thus\rdid the sons of Antenor meet their fate at the hands of the son of\rAtreus, and go down into the house of Hades. \r\rAs long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon went\rabout attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword and with\rgreat handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and\rthe wound grew dry, the pain became great. As the sharp pangs which\rthe Eilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth, daughters of Juno and dispensers\rof cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labour- even so sharp\rwere the pangs of the son of Atreus. He sprang on to his chariot,\rand bade his charioteer drive to the ships, for he was in great agony.\rWith a loud clear voice he shouted to the Danaans, "My friends, princes\rand counsellors of the Argives, defend the ships yourselves, for Jove\rhas not suffered me to fight the whole day through against the Trojans."\r\rWith this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and\rthey flew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foam\rand their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of\rthe battle. \r\rWhen Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the Trojans\rand Lycians saying, "Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian warriors, be\rmen, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; their best\rman has left them, and Jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph; charge\rthe foe with your chariots that. you may win still greater glory."\r\rWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a huntsman\rhounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so did Hector,\rpeer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the Achaeans. Full\rof hope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fight like\rsome fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes its\rdeep blue waters into fury. \r\rWhat, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killed\rin the hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him? First Asaeus,\rAutonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius, Opheltius and Agelaus;\rAesymnus, Orus and Hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftains\rof the Achaeans did Hector slay, and then he fell upon the rank and\rfile. As when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white south\rand beats them down with the fierceness of its fury- the waves of\rthe sea roll high, and the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the\rwandering wind- even so thick were the heads of them that fell by\rthe hand of Hector. \r\rAll had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would\rhave fled pell-mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out to Diomed,\r"Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forget our prowess?\rCome, my good fellow, stand by my side and help me, we shall be shamed\rfor ever if Hector takes the ships." \r\rAnd Diomed answered, "Come what may, I will stand firm; but we shall\rhave scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to the Trojans\rrather than to us." \r\rWith these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to the ground,\rsmiting him in the left breast with his spear, while Ulysses killed\rMolion who was his squire. These they let lie, now that they had stopped\rtheir fighting; the two heroes then went on playing havoc with the\rfoe, like two wild boars that turn in fury and rend the hounds that\rhunt them. Thus did they turn upon the Trojans and slay them, and\rthe Achaeans were thankful to have breathing time in their flight\rfrom Hector. \r\rThey then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of Merops\rof Percote, who excelled all others in the arts of divination. He\rhad forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they would not obey him,\rfor fate lured them to their fall. Diomed son of Tydeus slew them\rboth and stripped them of their armour, while Ulysses killed Hippodamus\rand Hypeirochus. \r\rAnd now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained that\rneither side should have the advantage, and they kept on killing one\ranother. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of Paeon in the\rhip-joint with his spear. His chariot was not at hand for him to fly\rwith, so blindly confident had he been. His squire was in charge of\rit at some distance and he was fighting on foot among the foremost\runtil he lost his life. Hector soon marked the havoc Diomed and Ulysses\rwere making, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followed by\rthe Trojan ranks; brave Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and\rsaid to Ulysses who was beside him, "Great Hector is bearing down\rupon us and we shall be undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset."\r\rHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss his\rmark. He had aimed at Hector\'s head near the top of his helmet, but\rbronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was untouched, for the spear\rwas stayed by the visored helm made with three plates of metal, which\rPhoebus Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a great bound\runder cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and propped himself\rwith his brawny hand leaning on the ground, for darkness had fallen\ron his eyes. The son of Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among\rthe foremost fighters, to the place where he had seen it strike the\rground; meanwhile Hector recovered himself and springing back into\rhis chariot mingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life.\rBut Diomed made at him with his spear and said, "Dog, you have again\rgot away though death was close on your heels. Phoebus Apollo, to\rwhom I ween you pray ere you go into battle, has again saved you,\rnevertheless I will meet you and make and end of you hereafter, if\rthere is any god who will stand by me too and be my helper. For the\rpresent I must pursue those I can lay hands on." \r\rAs he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, but\rAlexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him, leaning\ragainst a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son\rof Dardanus, a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken the cuirass\rfrom off the breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and the\rshield from off his shoulders, when Paris drew his bow and let fly\ran arrow that sped not from his hand in vain, but pierced the flat\rof Diomed\'s right foot, going right through it and fixing itself in\rthe ground. Thereon Paris with a hearty laugh sprang forward from\rhis hiding-place, and taunted him saying, "You are wounded- my arrow\rhas not been shot in vain; would that it had hit you in the belly\rand killed you, for thus the Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a\rlion, would have had a truce from evil." \r\rDiomed all undaunted answered, "Archer, you who without your bow are\rnothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in single\rcombat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serve\ryou in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched\rthe sole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy\rhad hit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when\rI wound a man though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for\rmy weapon will lay him low. His wife will tear her cheeks for grief\rand his children will be fatherless: there will he rot, reddening\rthe earth with his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round\rhim." \r\rThus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under this\rcover he sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was the\rpain he suffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his chariot and\rbade the charioteer drive him to the ships, for he was sick at heart.\r\rUlysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for they\rwere all panic-stricken. "Alas," said he to himself in his dismay,\r"what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly before these\rodds, but it will be worse if I am left alone and taken prisoner,\rfor the son of Saturn has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic.\rBut why talk to myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowards\rquit the field, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must stand\rfirm and hold his own." \r\rWhile he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced\rand hemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to me it. As hounds\rand lusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lair whetting\rhis white tusks- they attack him from every side and can hear the\rgnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still hold their\rground- even so furiously did the Trojans attack Ulysses. First he\rsprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and wounded him on the shoulder\rwith a downward blow; then he killed Thoon and Ennomus. After these\rhe struck Chersidamas in the loins under his shield as he had just\rsprung down from his chariot; so he fell in the dust and clutched\rthe earth in the hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and went on\rto wound Charops son of Hippasus own brother to noble Socus. Socus,\rhero that he was, made all speed to help him, and when he was close\rto Ulysses he said, "Far-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil,\rthis day you shall either boast of having killed both the sons of\rHippasus and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall before\rmy spear." \r\rWith these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear went through\rthe shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass, tearing\rthe flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did not suffer it to pierce\rthe entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew that his hour was not yet come,\rbut he gave ground and said to Socus, "Wretch, you shall now surely\rdie. You have stayed me from fighting further with the Trojans, but\ryou shall now fall by my spear, yielding glory to myself, and your\rsoul to Hades of the noble steeds." \r\rSocus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck him\rin the back midway between the shoulders, and went right through his\rchest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses vaunted over him\rsaying, "O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of horses, death has been\rtoo quick for you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, not even\rin death shall your father and mother close your eyes, but the ravening\rvultures shall enshroud you with the flapping of their dark wings\rand devour you. Whereas even though I fall the Achaeans will give\rme my due rites of burial." \r\rSo saying he drew Socus\'s heavy spear out of his flesh and from his\rshield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn so\rthat he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Ulysses was bleeding\rthey raised a great shout and came on in a body towards him; he therefore\rgave ground, and called his comrades to come and help him. Thrice\rdid he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice did brave Menelaus\rhear him; he turned, therefore, to Ajax who was close beside him and\rsaid, "Ajax, noble son of Telamon, captain of your people, the cry\rof Ulysses rings in my ears, as though the Trojans had cut him off\rand were worsting him while he is single-handed. Let us make our way\rthrough the throng; it will be well that we defend him; I fear he\rmay come to harm for all his valour if he be left without support,\rand the Danaans would miss him sorely." \r\rHe led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had gathered\rround Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the carcase of\rsome homed stag that has been hit with an arrow- the stag has fled\rat full speed so long as his blood was warm and his strength has lasted,\rbut when the arrow has overcome him, the savage jackals devour him\rin the shady glades of the forest. Then heaven sends a fierce lion\rthither, whereon the jackals fly in terror and the lion robs them\rof their prey- even so did Trojans many and brave gather round crafty\rUlysses, but the hero stood at bay and kept them off with his spear.\rAjax then came up with his shield before him like a wall, and stood\rhard by, whereon the Trojans fled in all directions. Menelaus took\rUlysses by the hand, and led him out of the press while his squire\rbrought up his chariot, but Ajax rushed furiously on the Trojans and\rkilled Doryclus, a bastard son of Priam; then he wounded Pandocus,\rLysandrus, Pyrasus, and Pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes rushing\rin full flood from the mountains on to the plain, big with the rain\rof heaven- many a dry oak and many a pine does it engulf, and much\rmud does it bring down and cast into the sea- even so did brave Ajax\rchase the foe furiously over the plain, slaying both men and horses.\r\rHector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting on\rthe extreme left of the battle by the banks of the river Scamander,\rwhere the carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round Nestor\rand brave Idomeneus. Among these Hector was making great slaughter\rwith his spear and furious driving, and was destroying the ranks that\rwere opposed to him; still the Achaeans would have given no ground,\rhad not Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen stayed the prowess of Machaon\rshepherd of his people, by wounding him in the right shoulder with\ra triple-barbed arrow. The Achaeans were in great fear that as the\rfight had turned against them the Trojans might take him prisoner,\rand Idomeneus said to Nestor, "Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the\rAchaean name, mount your chariot at once; take Machaon with you and\rdrive your horses to the ships as fast as you can. A physician is\rworth more than several other men put together, for he can cut out\rarrows and spread healing herbs." \r\rNestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he at once\rmounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physician Aesculapius\rwent with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onward nothing loth\rtowards the ships, as though of their own free will. \r\rThen Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector from\rhis place beside him, "Hector, here are we two fighting on the extreme\rwing of the battle, while the other Trojans are in pell-mell rout,\rthey and their horses. Ajax son of Telamon is driving them before\rhim; I know him by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot\rand horses thither, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately,\rand where the cry of battle is loudest." \r\rWith this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whip\rthey drew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and Trojans, over\rthe bodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle was bespattered\rwith blood, and the rail round the car was covered with splashes both\rfrom the horses\' hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels. Hector tore\rhis way through and flung himself into the thick of the fight, and\rhis presence threw the Danaans into confusion, for his spear was not\rlong idle; nevertheless though he went among the ranks with sword\rand spear, and throwing great stones, he avoided Ajax son of Telamon,\rfor Jove would have been angry with him if he had fought a better\rman than himself. \r\rThen father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart of\rAjax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind him-\rlooking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were some\rwild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowly backwards.\rAs peasants with their hounds chase a lion from their stockyard, and\rwatch by night to prevent his carrying off the pick of their herd-\rhe makes his greedy spring, but in vain, for the darts from many a\rstrong hand fall thick around him, with burning brands that scare\rhim for all his fury, and when morning comes he slinks foiled and\rangry away- even so did Ajax, sorely against his will, retreat angrily\rbefore the Trojans, fearing for the ships of the Achaeans. Or as some\rlazy ass that has had many a cudgel broken about his back, when he\rinto a field begins eating the corn- boys beat him but he is too many\rfor them, and though they lay about with their sticks they cannot\rhurt him; still when he has had his fill they at last drive him from\rthe field- even so did the Trojans and their allies pursue great Ajax,\rever smiting the middle of his shield with their darts. Now and again\rhe would turn and show fight, keeping back the battalions of the Trojans,\rand then he would again retreat; but he prevented any of them from\rmaking his way to the ships. Single-handed he stood midway between\rthe Trojans and Achaeans: the spears that sped from their hands stuck\rsome of them in his mighty shield, while many, though thirsting for\rhis blood, fell to the ground ere they could reach him to the wounding\rof his fair flesh. \r\rNow when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax was being\roverpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and hurled his\rspear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver below the midriff,\rand laid him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him, and stripped the armour\rfrom his shoulders; but when Alexandrus saw him, he aimed an arrow\rat him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrow broke, but the\rpoint that was left in the wound dragged on the thigh; he drew back,\rtherefore, under cover of his comrades to save his life, shouting\ras he did so to the Danaans, "My friends, princes and counsellors\rof the Argives, rally to the defence of Ajax who is being overpowered,\rand I doubt whether he will come out of the fight alive. Hither, then,\rto the rescue of great Ajax son of Telamon." \r\rEven so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came near,\rand gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from their shoulders\rso as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards them, and turned round\rto stand at bay as soon as he had reached his men. \r\rThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the\rmares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor out\rof the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achilles\rsaw and took note, for he was standing on the stern of his ship watching\rthe hard stress and struggle of the fight. He called from the ship\rto his comrade Patroclus, who heard him in the tent and came out looking\rlike Mars himself- here indeed was the beginning of the ill that presently\rbefell him. "Why," said he, "Achilles do you call me? what do you\rwhat do you want with me?" And Achilles answered, "Noble son of Menoetius,\rman after my own heart, I take it that I shall now have the Achaeans\rpraying at my knees, for they are in great straits; go, Patroclus,\rand ask Nestor who is that he is bearing away wounded from the field;\rfrom his back I should say it was Machaon son of Aesculapius, but\rI could not see his face for the horses went by me at full speed."\r\rPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off running\rby the ships and tents of the Achaeans. \r\rWhen Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son of Neleus,\rthey dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the horses from the\rchariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the seaside to dry the\rsweat from their shirts, and when they had so done they came inside\rand took their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom Nestor had had awarded to\rhim from Tenedos when Achilles took it, mixed them a mess; she was\rdaughter of wise Arsinous, and the Achaeans had given her to Nestor\rbecause he excelled all of them in counsel. First she set for them\ra fair and well-made table that had feet of cyanus; on it there was\ra vessel of bronze and an onion to give relish to the drink, with\rhoney and cakes of barley-meal. There was also a cup of rare workmanship\rwhich the old man had brought with him from home, studded with bosses\rof gold; it had four handles, on each of which there were two golden\rdoves feeding, and it had two feet to stand on. Any one else would\rhardly have been able to lift it from the table when it was full,\rbut Nestor could do so quite easily. In this the woman, as fair as\ra goddess, mixed them a mess with Pramnian wine; she grated goat\'s\rmilk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in a handful of white\rbarley-meal, and having thus prepared the mess she bade them drink\rit. When they had done so and had thus quenched their thirst, they\rfell talking with one another, and at this moment Patroclus appeared\rat the door. \r\rWhen the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand,\rled him into the tent, and bade him take his place among them; but\rPatroclus stood where he was and said, "Noble sir, I may not stay,\ryou cannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is not one to be\rtrifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom you\rwere bearing away from the field. I can now see for myself that he\ris Machaon shepherd of his people. I must go back and tell Achilles.\rYou, sir, know what a terrible man he is, and how ready to blame even\rwhere no blame should lie." \r\rAnd Nestor answered, "Why should Achilles care to know how many of\rthe Achaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that reigns\rin our host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomed\rson of Tydeus is wounded; so are Ulysses and Agamemnon; Eurypylus\rhas been hit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing\rthis man from the field- he too wounded- with an arrow; nevertheless\rAchilles, so valiant though he be, cares not and knows no ruth. Will\rhe wait till the ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we perish\rone upon the other? As for me, I have no strength nor stay in me any\rlonger; would that I Were still young and strong as in the days when\rthere was a fight between us and the men of Elis about some cattle-raiding.\rI then killed Itymoneus the valiant son of Hypeirochus a dweller in\rElis, as I was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown my\rhand while fighting in the front rank in defence of his cows, so he\rfell and the country people around him were in great fear. We drove\roff a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds of cattle\rand as many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, and as many\rwide-spreading flocks of goats. Of horses moreover we seized a hundred\rand fifty, all of them mares, and many had foals running with them.\rAll these did we drive by night to Pylus the city of Neleus, taking\rthem within the city; and the heart of Neleus was glad in that I had\rtaken so much, though it was the first time I had ever been in the\rfield. At daybreak the heralds went round crying that all in Elis\rto whom there was a debt owing should come; and the leading Pylians\rassembled to divide the spoils. There were many to whom the Epeans\rowed chattels, for we men of Pylus were few and had been oppressed\rwith wrong; in former years Hercules had come, and had laid his hand\rheavy upon us, so that all our best men had perished. Neleus had had\rtwelve sons, but I alone was left; the others had all been killed.\rThe Epeans presuming upon all this had looked down upon us and had\rdone us much evil. My father chose a herd of cattle and a great flock\rof sheep- three hundred in all- and he took their shepherds with him,\rfor there was a great debt due to him in Elis, to wit four horses,\rwinners of prizes. They and their chariots with them had gone to the\rgames and were to run for a tripod, but King Augeas took them, and\rsent back their driver grieving for the loss of his horses. Neleus\rwas angered by what he had both said and done, and took great value\rin return, but he divided the rest, that no man might have less than\rhis full share. \r\r"Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods throughout\rthe city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in a body, many\rin number, they and their chariots, in full array, and with them the\rtwo Moliones in their armour, though they were still lads and unused\rto fighting. Now there is a certain town, Thryoessa, perched upon\ra rock on the river Alpheus, the border city Pylus; this they would\rdestroy, and pitched their camp about it, but when they had crossed\rtheir whole plain, Minerva darted down by night from Olympus and bade\rus set ourselves in array; and she found willing soldiers in Pylos,\rfor the men meant fighting. Neleus would not let me arm, and hid my\rhorses, for he said that as yet I could know nothing about war; nevertheless\rMinerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as I was, I fought\ramong our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of them. There\ris a river Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene, and there\rthey that were mounted (and I with them) waited till morning, when\rthe companies of foot soldiers came up with us in force. Thence in\rfull panoply and equipment we came towards noon to the sacred waters\rof the Alpheus, and there we offered victims to almighty Jove, with\ra bull to Alpheus, another to Neptune, and a herd-heifer to Minerva.\rAfter this we took supper in our companies, and laid us down to rest\reach in his armour by the river. \r\r"The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to take\rit, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in store for\rthem. When the sun\'s rays began to fall upon the earth we joined battle,\rpraying to Jove and to Minerva, and when the fight had begun, I was\rthe first to kill my man and take his horses- to wit the warrior Mulius.\rHe was son-in-law to Augeas, having married his eldest daughter, golden-haired\rAgamede, who knew the virtues of every herb which grows upon the face\rof the earth. I speared him as he was coming towards me, and when\rhe fell headlong in the dust, I sprang upon his chariot and took my\rplace in the front ranks. The Epeans fled in all directions when they\rsaw the captain of their horsemen (the best man they had) laid low,\rand I swept down on them like a whirlwind, taking fifty chariots-\rand in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my spear. I should\rhave even killed the two Moliones sons of Actor, unless their real\rfather, Neptune lord of the earthquake, had hidden them in a thick\rmist and borne them out of the fight. Thereon Jove vouchsafed the\rPylians a great victory, for we chased them far over the plain, killing\rthe men and bringing in their armour, till we had brought our horses\rto Buprasium rich in wheat and to the Olenian rock, with the hill\rthat is called Alision, at which point Minerva turned the people back.\rThere I slew the last man and left him; then the Achaeans drove their\rhorses back from Buprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among\rthe gods, and among mortal men to Nestor. \r\r"Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles is\rfor keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue it hereafter\rwhen the host is being cut to pieces. My good friend, did not Menoetius\rcharge you thus, on the day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon?\rUlysses and I were in the house, inside, and heard all that he said\rto you; for we came to the fair house of Peleus while beating up recruits\rthroughout all Achaea, and when we got there we found Menoetius and\ryourself, and Achilles with you. The old knight Peleus was in the\router court, roasting the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to Jove the\rlord of thunder; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from which\rhe poured drink-offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice. You\rtwo were busy cutting up the heifer, and at that moment we stood at\rthe gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led us by the hand\rinto the house, placed us at table, and set before us such hospitable\rentertainment as guests expect. When we had satisfied ourselves with\rmeat and drink, I said my say and urged both of you to join us. You\rwere ready enough to do so, and the two old men charged you much and\rstraitly. Old Peleus bade his son Achilles fight ever among the foremost\rand outvie his peers, while Menoetius the son of Actor spoke thus\rto you: \'My son,\' said he, \'Achilles is of nobler birth than you are,\rbut you are older than he, though he is far the better man of the\rtwo. Counsel him wisely, guide him in the right way, and he will follow\ryou to his own profit.\' Thus did your father charge you, but you have\rforgotten; nevertheless, even now, say all this to Achilles if he\rwill listen to you. Who knows but with heaven\'s help you may talk\rhim over, for it is good to take a friend\'s advice. If, however, he\ris fearful about some oracle, or if his mother has told him something\rfrom Jove, then let him send you, and let the rest of the Myrmidons\rfollow with you, if perchance you may bring light and saving to the\rDanaans. And let him send you into battle clad in his own armour,\rthat the Trojans may mistake you for him and leave off fighting; the\rsons of the Achaeans may thus have time to get their breath, for they\rare hard pressed and there is little breathing time in battle. You,\rwho are fresh, might easily drive a tired enemy back to his walls\rand away from the tents and ships." \r\rWith these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set off running\rby the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of Aeacus. When he\rhad got as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was their place of assembly\rand court of justice, with their altars dedicated to the gods, Eurypylus\rson of Euaemon met him, wounded in the thigh with an arrow, and limping\rout of the fight. Sweat rained from his head and shoulders, and black\rblood welled from his cruel wound, but his mind did not wander. The\rson of Menoetius when he saw him had compassion upon him and spoke\rpiteously saying, "O unhappy princes and counsellors of the Danaans,\rare you then doomed to feed the hounds of Troy with your fat, far\rfrom your friends and your native land? say, noble Eurypylus, will\rthe Achaeans be able to hold great Hector in check, or will they fall\rnow before his spear?" \r\rWounded Eurypylus made answer, "Noble Patroclus, there is no hope\rleft for the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All they\rthat were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the\rhands of the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. But save\rme and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash\rthe black blood from off it with warm water, and lay upon it those\rgracious herbs which, so they say, have been shown you by Achilles,\rwho was himself shown them by Chiron, most righteous of all the centaurs.\rFor of the physicians Podalirius and Machaon, I hear that the one\ris lying wounded in his tent and is himself in need of healing, while\rthe other is fighting the Trojans upon the plain." \r\r"Hero Eurypylus," replied the brave son of Menoetius, "how may these\rthings be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to noble\rAchilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even\rso I will not be unmindful your distress." \r\rWith this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent,\rand a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground\rfor him to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharp\rarrow from his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound with\rwarm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his\rhands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb which\rkilled all pain; so the wound presently dried and the blood left off\rflowing. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XII\r\rSo the son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypylus within\rthe tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought desperately, nor\rwere the trench and the high wall above it, to keep the Trojans in\rcheck longer. They had built it to protect their ships, and had dug\rthe trench all round it that it might safeguard both the ships and\rthe rich spoils which they had taken, but they had not offered hecatombs\rto the gods. It had been built without the consent of the immortals,\rand therefore it did not last. So long as Hector lived and Achilles\rnursed his anger, and so long as the city of Priam remained untaken,\rthe great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of\rthe Trojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though some\rwere yet left alive when, moreover, the city was sacked in the tenth\ryear, and the Argives had gone back with their ships to their own\rcountry- then Neptune and Apollo took counsel to destroy the wall,\rand they turned on to it the streams of all the rivers from Mount\rIda into the sea, Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, Rhodius, Grenicus,\rAesopus, and goodly Scamander, with Simois, where many a shield and\rhelm had fallen, and many a hero of the race of demigods had bitten\rthe dust. Phoebus Apollo turned the mouths of all these rivers together\rand made them flow for nine days against the wall, while Jove rained\rthe whole time that he might wash it sooner into the sea. Neptune\rhimself, trident in hand, surveyed the work and threw into the sea\rall the foundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid\rwith so much toil; he made all level by the mighty stream of the Hellespont,\rand then when he had swept the wall away he spread a great beach of\rsand over the place where it had been. This done he turned the rivers\rback into their old courses. \r\rThis was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but as\ryet battle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till its timbers\rrang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives, cowed by\rthe scourge of Jove, were hemmed in at their ships in fear of Hector\rthe mighty minister of Rout, who as heretofore fought with the force\rand fury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild boar turns fiercely on\rthe dogs and men that attack him, while these form solid wall and\rshower their javelins as they face him- his courage is all undaunted,\rbut his high spirit will be the death of him; many a time does he\rcharge at his pursuers to scatter them, and they fall back as often\ras he does so- even so did Hector go about among the host exhorting\rhis men, and cheering them on to cross the trench. \r\rBut the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink,\rfor the width frightened them. They could neither jump it nor cross\rit, for it had overhanging banks all round upon either side, above\rwhich there were the sharp stakes that the sons of the Achaeans had\rplanted so close and strong as a defence against all who would assail\rit; a horse, therefore, could not get into it and draw his chariot\rafter him, but those who were on foot kept trying their very utmost.\rThen Polydamas went up to Hector and said, "Hector, and you other\rcaptains of the Trojans and allies, it is madness for us to try and\rdrive our horses across the trench; it will be very hard to cross,\rfor it is full of sharp stakes, and beyond these there is the wall.\rOur horses therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of no use\rif they did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come to harm.\rIf, indeed, great Jove is minded to help the Trojans, and in his anger\rwill utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would myself gladly see them\rperish now and here far from Argos; but if they should rally and we\rare driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trench there will\rbe not so much as a man get back to the city to tell the tale. Now,\rtherefore, let us all do as I say; let our squires hold our horses\rby the trench, but let us follow Hector in a body on foot, clad in\rfull armour, and if the day of their doom is at hand the Achaeans\rwill not be able to withstand us." \r\rThus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang in\rfull armour to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when they saw\rhim do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his horses\rover to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready for him at the\rtrench. Then they formed themselves into companies, made themselves\rready, and in five bodies followed their leaders. Those that went\rwith Hector and Polydamas were the bravest and most in number, and\rthe most determined to break through the wall and fight at the ships.\rCebriones was also joined with them as third in command, for Hector\rhad left his chariot in charge of a less valiant soldier. The next\rcompany was led by Paris, Alcathous, and Agenor; the third by Helenus\rand Deiphobus, two sons of Priam, and with them was the hero Asius-\rAsius the son of Hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the breed that\rcomes from the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe. Aeneas the\rvaliant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two sons of Antenor,\rArchelochus and Acamas, men well versed in all the arts of war. Sarpedon\rwas captain over the allies, and took with him Glaucus and Asteropaeus\rwhom he deemed most valiant after himself- for he was far the best\rman of them all. These helped to array one another in their ox-hide\rshields, and then charged straight at the Danaans, for they felt sure\rthat they would not hold out longer and that they should themselves\rnow fall upon the ships. \r\rThe rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel\rof Polydamas but Asius son of Hyrtacus would not leave his horses\rand his esquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took them on with\rhim towards the ships, nor did he fail to come by his end in consequence.\rNevermore was he to return to wind-beaten Ilius, exulting in his chariot\rand his horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omened name had overshadowed\rhim and he had fallen by the spear of Idomeneus the noble son of Deucalion.\rHe had driven towards the left wing of the ships, by which way the\rAchaeans used to return with their chariots and horses from the plain.\rHither he drove and found the gates with their doors opened wide,\rand the great bar down- for the gatemen kept them open so as to let\rthose of their comrades enter who might be flying towards the ships.\rHither of set purpose did he direct his horses, and his men followed\rhim with a loud cry, for they felt sure that the Achaeans would not\rhold out longer, and that they should now fall upon the ships. Little\rdid they know that at the gates they should find two of the bravest\rchieftains, proud sons of the fighting Lapithae- the one, Polypoetes,\rmighty son of Pirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer of murderous\rMars. These stood before the gates like two high oak trees upon the\rmountains, that tower from their wide-spreading roots, and year after\ryear battle with wind and rain- even so did these two men await the\ronset of great Asius confidently and without flinching. The Trojans\rled by him and by Iamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of Asius, Thoon\rand Oenomaus, raised a loud cry of battle and made straight for the\rwall, holding their shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for\ra while the two defenders remained inside and cheered the Achaeans\ron to stand firm in the defence of their ships; when, however, they\rsaw that the Trojans were attacking the wall, while the Danaans were\rcrying out for help and being routed, they rushed outside and fought\rin front of the gates like two wild boars upon the mountains that\rabide the attack of men and dogs, and charging on either side break\rdown the wood all round them tearing it up by the roots, and one can\rhear the clattering of their tusks, till some one hits them and makes\ran end of them- even so did the gleaming bronze rattle about their\rbreasts, as the weapons fell upon them; for they fought with great\rfury, trusting to their own prowess and to those who were on the wall\rabove them. These threw great stones at their assailants in defence\rof themselves their tents and their ships. The stones fell thick as\rthe flakes of snow which some fierce blast drives from the dark clouds\rand showers down in sheets upon the earth- even so fell the weapons\rfrom the hands alike of Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang\rout as the great stones rained upon them, and Asius the son of Hyrtacus\rin his dismay cried aloud and smote his two thighs. "Father Jove,"\rhe cried, "of a truth you too are altogether given to lying. I made\rsure the Argive heroes could not withstand us, whereas like slim-waisted\rwasps, or bees that have their nests in the rocks by the wayside-\rthey leave not the holes wherein they have built undefended, but fight\rfor their little ones against all who would take them- even so these\rmen, though they be but two, will not be driven from the gates, but\rstand firm either to slay or be slain." \r\rHe spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it then was\rto give glory to Hector. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans were fighting\rabout the other gates; I, however, am no god to be able to tell about\rall these things, for the battle raged everywhere about the stone\rwall as it were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited though they\rwere, were forced to defend their ships, and all the gods who were\rdefending the Achaeans were vexed in spirit; but the Lapithae kept\ron fighting with might and main. \r\rThereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with a spear\rupon his cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect him, for\rthe point of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, so that\rthe brain inside was scattered about, and he died fighting. He then\rslew Pylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race of Mars, killed Hippomachus\rthe son of Antimachus by striking him with his spear upon the girdle.\rHe then drew his sword and sprang first upon Antiphates whom he killed\rin combat, and who fell face upwards on the earth. After him he killed\rMenon, Iamenus, and Orestes, and laid them low one after the other.\r\rWhile they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, the youths\rwho were led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were the greater\rpart and the most valiant of those that were trying to break through\rthe wall and fire the ships) were still standing by the trench, uncertain\rwhat they should do; for they had seen a sign from heaven when they\rhad essayed to cross it- a soaring eagle that flew skirting the left\rwing of their host, with a monstrous blood-red snake in its talons\rstill alive and struggling to escape. The snake was still bent on\rrevenge, wriggling and twisting itself backwards till it struck the\rbird that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the bird being\rin pain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host, and\rthen flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans were struck\rwith terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing Jove,\rwrithing in the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to Hector and\rsaid, "Hector, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebuke\rme, even when I speak wisely, as though it were not well, forsooth,\rthat one of the people should cross your will either in the field\ror at the council board; you would have them support you always: nevertheless\rI will say what I think will be best; let us not now go on to fight\rthe Danaans at their ships, for I know what will happen if this soaring\reagle which skirted the left wing of our with a monstrous blood-red\rsnake in its talons (the snake being still alive) was really sent\ras an omen to the Trojans on their essaying to cross the trench. The\reagle let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking it home to her\rlittle ones, and so will it be- with ourselves; even though by a mighty\reffort we break through the gates and wall of the Achaeans, and they\rgive way before us, still we shall not return in good order by the\rway we came, but shall leave many a man behind us whom the Achaeans\rwill do to death in defence of their ships. Thus would any seer who\rwas expert in these matters, and was trusted by the people, read the\rportent." \r\rHector looked fiercely at him and said, "Polydamas, I like not of\ryour reading. You can find a better saying than this if you will.\rIf, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven\rrobbed you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed to the counsels\rof Jove, nor to the promises he made me- and he bowed his head in\rconfirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of wild-fowl.\rWhat care I whether they fly towards dawn or dark, and whether they\rbe on my right hand or on my left? Let us put our trust rather in\rthe counsel of great Jove, king of mortals and immortals. There is\rone omen, and one only- that a man should fight for his country. Why\rare you so fearful? Though we be all of us slain at the ships of the\rArgives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for you are not\rsteadfast nor courageous. If you will. not fight, or would talk others\rover from doing so, you shall fall forthwith before my spear."\r\rWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after with\ra cry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord of thunder sent the blast\rof a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore the dust down\rtowards the ships; he thus lulled the Achaeans into security, and\rgave victory to Hector and to the Trojans, who, trusting to their\rown might and to the signs he had shown them, essayed to break through\rthe great wall of the Achaeans. They tore down the breastworks from\rthe walls, and overthrew the battlements; they upheaved the buttresses,\rwhich the Achaeans had set in front of the wall in order to support\rit; when they had pulled these down they made sure of breaking through\rthe wall, but the Danaans still showed no sign of giving ground; they\rstill fenced the battlements with their shields of ox-hide, and hurled\rtheir missiles down upon the foe as soon as any came below the wall.\r\rThe two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the\rAchaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to any\rone whom they saw to be remiss. "My friends," they cried, "Argives\rone and all- good bad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet,\rin which all were of equal prowess- there is now work enough, as you\rvery well know, for all of you. See that you none of you turn in flight\rtowards the ships, daunted by the shouting of the foe, but press forward\rand keep one another in heart, if it may so be that Olympian Jove\rthe lord of lightning will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and drive\rthem back towards the city." \r\rThus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on. As\rthe flakes that fall thick upon a winter\'s day, when Jove is minded\rto snow and to display these his arrows to mankind- he lulls the wind\rto rest, and snows hour after hour till he has buried the tops of\rthe high mountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassy\rplains, and the tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon the\rforelands, and havens of the grey sea, but the waves as they come\rrolling in stay it that it can come no further, though all else is\rwrapped as with a mantle so heavy are the heavens with snow- even\rthus thickly did the stones fall on one side and on the other, some\rthrown at the Trojans, and some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; and\rthe whole wall was in an uproar. \r\rStill the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken down\rthe gates and the great bar, had not Jove turned his son Sarpedon\ragainst the Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle. Before\rhim he held his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith had beaten\rso fair and round, and had lined with ox hides which he had made fast\rwith rivets of gold all round the shield; this he held in front of\rhim, and brandishing his two spears came on like some lion of the\rwilderness, who has been long famished for want of meat and will dare\rbreak even into a well-fenced homestead to try and get at the sheep.\rHe may find the shepherds keeping watch over their flocks with dogs\rand spears, but he is in no mind to be driven from the fold till he\rhas had a try for it; he will either spring on a sheep and carry it\roff, or be hit by a spear from strong hand- even so was Sarpedon fain\rto attack the wall and break down its battlements. Then he said to\rGlaucus son of Hippolochus, "Glaucus, why in Lycia do we receive especial\rhonour as regards our place at table? Why are the choicest portions\rserved us and our cups kept brimming, and why do men look up to us\ras though we were gods? Moreover we hold a large estate by the banks\rof the river Xanthus, fair with orchard lawns and wheat-growing land;\rit becomes us, therefore, to take our stand at the head of all the\rLycians and bear the brunt of the fight, that one may say to another,\rOur princes in Lycia eat the fat of the land and drink best of wine,\rbut they are fine fellows; they fight well and are ever at the front\rin battle.\' My good friend, if, when we were once out of this fight,\rwe could escape old age and death thenceforward and for ever, I should\rneither press forward myself nor bid you do so, but death in ten thousand\rshapes hangs ever over our heads, and no man can elude him; therefore\rlet us go forward and either win glory for ourselves, or yield it\rto another." \r\rGlaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host\rof Lycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw them,\rfor it was against his part of the wall that they came- bringing destruction\rwith them; he looked along the wall for some chieftain to support\rhis comrades and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for the fray,\rand Teucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them; but\rhe could not make his voice heard by shouting to them, so great an\ruproar was there from crashing shields and helmets and the battering\rof gates with a din which reached the skies. For all the gates had\rbeen closed, and the Trojans were hammering at them to try and break\rtheir way through them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thootes with a\rmessage to Ajax. "Run, good Thootes," said and call Ajax, or better\rstill bid both come, for it will be all over with us here directly;\rthe leaders of the Lycians are upon us, men who have ever fought desperately\rheretofore. But if the have too much on their hands to let them come,\rat any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer the famous\rbowman come with him." \r\rThe messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the wall\rof the Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them, "Sirs,\rprinces of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you come to him\rfor a while and help him. You had better both come if you can, or\rit will be all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians\rare upon him, men who have ever fought desperately heretofore; if\ryou have too much on your hands to let both come, at any rate let\rAjax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer the famous bowman come with\rhim." \r\rGreat Ajax, son of Telamon, heeded the message, and at once spoke\rto the son of Oileus. "Ajax," said he, "do you two, yourself and brave\rLycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight their\rhardest. I will go over yonder, and bear my part in the fray, but\rI will come back here at once as soon as I have given them the help\rthey need." \r\rWith this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer his brother by\rthe same father went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer\'s bow. They\rwent along inside the wall, and when they came to the tower where\rMenestheus was (and hard pressed indeed did they find him) the brave\rcaptains and leaders of the Lycians were storming the battlements\ras it were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raising\rthe battle-cry aloud. \r\rFirst, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade of Sarpedon,\rhitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the battlements at the\rvery top of the wall. As men now are, even one who is in the bloom\rof youth could hardly lift it with his two hands, but Ajax raised\rit high aloft and flung it down, smashing Epicles\' four-crested helmet\rso that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell\rfrom the high wall as though he were diving, with no more life left\rin him. Then Teucer wounded Glaucus the brave son of Hippolochus as\rhe was coming on to attack the wall. He saw his shoulder bare and\raimed an arrow at it, which made Glaucus leave off fighting. Thereon\rhe sprang covertly down for fear some of the Achaeans might see that\rhe was wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon was stung with grief when he\rsaw Glaucus leave him, still he did not leave off fighting, but aimed\rhis spear at Alcmaon the son of Thestor and hit him. He drew his spear\rback again Alcmaon came down headlong after it with his bronzed armour\rrattling round him. Then Sarpedon seized the battlement in his strong\rhands, and tugged at it till it an gave way together, and a breach\rwas made through which many might pass. \r\rAjax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him with\ran arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his body,\rbut Jove saved his son from destruction that he might not fall by\rthe ships\' sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and pierced his shield,\rbut the spear did not go clean through, though it hustled him back\rthat he could come on no further. He therefore retired a little space\rfrom the battlement, yet without losing all his ground, for he still\rthought to cover himself with glory. Then he turned round and shouted\rto the brave Lycians saying, "Lycians, why do you thus fail me? For\rall my prowess I cannot break through the wall and open a way to the\rships single-handed. Come close on behind me, for the more there are\rof us the better." \r\rThe Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who was\rtheir counsellor their king. The Argives on their part got their men\rin fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly struggle\rbetween them. The Lycians could not break through the wall and force\rtheir way to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians from\rthe wall now that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rods\rin hand, quarrel about their boundaries in a field that they own in\rcommon, and stickle for their rights though they be but in a mere\rstrip, even so did the battlements now serve as a bone of contention,\rand they beat one another\'s round shields for their possession. Many\ra man\'s body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as he turned round\rand bared his back to the foe, and many were struck clean through\rtheir shields; the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged with\rthe blood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans. But even so the Trojans\rcould not rout the Achaeans, who still held on; and as some honest\rhard-working woman weighs wool in her balance and sees that the scales\rbe true, for she would gain some pitiful earnings for her little ones,\reven so was the fight balanced evenly between them till the time came\rwhen Jove gave the greater glory to Hector son of Priam, who was first\rto spring towards the wall of the Achaeans. As he did so, he cried\raloud to the Trojans, "Up, Trojans, break the wall of the Argives,\rand fling fire upon their ships." \r\rThus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight at\rthe wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements with sharp\rspears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone that lay just outside\rthe gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other; two of\rthe best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise it from\rthe ground and put it on to a waggon, but Hector lifted it quite easily\rby himself, for the son of scheming Saturn made it light for him.\rAs a shepherd picks up a ram\'s fleece with one hand and finds it no\rburden, so easily did Hector lift the great stone and drive it right\rat the doors that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set. These\rdoors were double and high, and were kept closed by two cross-bars\rto which there was but one key. When he had got close up to them,\rHector strode towards them that his blow might gain in force and struck\rthem in the middle, leaning his whole weight against them. He broke\rboth hinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its great weight.\rThe portals re-echoed with the sound, the bars held no longer, and\rthe doors flew open, one one way, and the other the other, through\rthe force of the blow. Then brave Hector leaped inside with a face\ras dark as that of flying night. The gleaming bronze flashed fiercely\rabout his body and he had tow spears in his hand. None but a god could\rhave withstood him as he flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes\rglared like fire. Then he turned round towards the Trojans and called\ron them to scale the wall, and they did as he bade them- some of them\rat once climbing over the wall, while others passed through the gates.\rThe Danaans then fled panic-stricken towards their ships, and all\rwas uproar and confusion. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XIII\r\rNow when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the ships,\rhe left them to their never-ending toil, and turned his keen eyes\raway, looking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of Thrace, the\rMysians, fighters at close quarters, the noble Hippemolgi, who live\ron milk, and the Abians, justest of mankind. He no longer turned so\rmuch as a glance towards Troy, for he did not think that any of the\rimmortals would go and help either Trojans or Danaans. \r\rBut King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking admiringly\ron the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of wooded Samothrace,\rwhence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam and the ships\rof the Achaeans. He had come from under the sea and taken his place\rhere, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being overcome by the Trojans;\rand he was furiously angry with Jove. \r\rPresently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as he\rstrode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneath\rthe tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with the\rfourth he reached his goal- Aegae, where is his glittering golden\rpalace, imperishable, in the depths of the sea. When he got there,\rhe yoked his fleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold all\rflying in the wind; he clothed himself in raiment of gold, grasped\rhis gold whip, and took his stand upon his chariot. As he went his\rway over the waves the sea-monsters left their lairs, for they knew\rtheir lord, and came gambolling round him from every quarter of the\rdeep, while the sea in her gladness opened a path before his chariot.\rSo lightly did the horses fly that the bronze axle of the car was\rnot even wet beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took him to\rthe ships of the Achaeans. \r\rNow there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midway\rbetween Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of the earthquake\rstayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them their ambrosial\rforage. He hobbled their feet with hobbles of gold which none could\reither unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that place\runtil their lord should return. This done he went his way to the host\rof the Achaeans. \r\rNow the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like a\rstorm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raising\rthe cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of\rthe Achaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there. Meanwhile\rearth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered on the Argives,\rfor he had come up out of the sea and had assumed the form and voice\rof Calchas. \r\rFirst he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already,\rand said, "Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the Achaeans if you\rwill put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted.\rI am not afraid that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force,\rwill be victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all\rof them in check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here\rwhere furious Hector, who boasts himself the son of great Jove himself,\ris leading them on like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put\rit into your hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others\rto do the like. In this case you will drive him from the ships even\rthough he be inspired by Jove himself." \r\rAs he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck both\rof them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring. He made\rtheir legs light and active, as also their hands and their feet. Then,\ras the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above some sheer rock,\rand presently swoops down to chase some bird over the plain, even\rso did Neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight into the air\rand leave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the first\rto know who it was that had been speaking with them, and said to Ajax\rson of Telamon, "Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on Olympus,\rwho in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by our\rships. It was not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I knew him\rat once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the gods are\rsoon recognised. Moreover I feel the lust of battle burn more fiercely\rwithin me, while my hands and my feet under me are more eager for\rthe fray." \r\rAnd Ajax son of Telamon answered, "I too feel my hands grasp my spear\rmore firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more nimble; I long,\rmoreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam, even in single combat."\r\rThus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with which\rthe god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler roused the\rAchaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome at once\rby hard fighting and by grief at seeing that the Trojans had got over\rthe wall in force. Tears began falling from their eyes as they beheld\rthem, for they made sure that they should not escape destruction;\rbut the lord of the earthquake passed lightly about among them and\rurged their battalions to the front. \r\rFirst he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, and Thoas\rand Deipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant warriors; all\rdid he exhort. "Shame on you young Argives," he cried, "it was on\ryour prowess I relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight not\rwith might and main, this very day will see us overcome by the Trojans.\rOf a truth my eyes behold a great and terrible portent which I had\rnever thought to see- the Trojans at our ships- they, who were heretofore\rlike panic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and wolves in a forest,\rwith no strength but in flight for they cannot defend themselves.\rHitherto the Trojans dared not for one moment face the attack of the\rAchaeans, but now they have sallied far from their city and are fighting\rat our very ships through the cowardice of our leader and the disaffection\rof the people themselves, who in their discontent care not to fight\rin defence of the ships but are being slaughtered near them. True,\rKing Agamemnon son of Atreus is the cause of our disaster by having\rinsulted the son of Peleus, still this is no reason why we should\rleave off fighting. Let us be quick to heal, for the hearts of the\rbrave heal quickly. You do ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the\rfinest soldiers in our whole army. I blame no man for keeping out\rof battle if he is a weakling, but I am indignant with such men as\ryou are. My good friends, matters will soon become even worse through\rthis slackness; think, each one of you, of his own honour and credit,\rfor the hazard of the fight is extreme. Great Hector is now fighting\rat our ships; he has broken through the gates and the strong bolt\rthat held them." \r\rThus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge them on.\rThereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men, of\rwhom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could make light\rif they went among them, for they were the picked men of all those\rwho were now awaiting the onset of Hector and the Trojans. They made\ra living fence, spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler to buckler,\rhelmet to helmet, and man to man. The horse-hair crests on their gleaming\rhelmets touched one another as they nodded forward, so closely seffied\rwere they; the spears they brandished in their strong hands were interlaced,\rand their hearts were set on battle. \r\rThe Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their head pressing\rright on as a rock that comes thundering down the side of some mountain\rfrom whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; the foundations\rof the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain, and as it\rbounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in an uproar;\rit swerves neither to right nor left till it reaches level ground,\rbut then for all its fury it can go no further- even so easily did\rHector for a while seem as though he would career through the tents\rand ships of the Achaeans till he had reached the sea in his murderous\rcourse; but the closely serried battalions stayed him when he reached\rthem, for the sons of the Achaeans thrust at him with swords and spears\rpointed at both ends, and drove him from them so that he staggered\rand gave ground; thereon he shouted to the Trojans, "Trojans, Lycians,\rand Dardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: the Achaeans\rhave set themselves as a wall against me, but they will not check\rme for long; they will give ground before me if the mightiest of the\rgods, the thundering spouse of Juno, has indeed inspired my onset."\r\rWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobus son\rof Priam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with his\rround shield before him, under cover of which he strode quickly forward.\rMeriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hit the\rbroad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for the spear\rbroke in two pieces long ere he could do so; moreover Deiphobus had\rseen it coming and had held his shield well away from him. Meriones\rdrew back under cover of his comrades, angry alike at having failed\rto vanquish Deiphobus, and having broken his spear. He turned therefore\rtowards the ships and tents to fetch a spear which he had left behind\rin his tent. \r\rThe others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into\rthe heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man,\rto wit, the warrior Imbrius son of Mentor rich in horses. Until the\rAchaeans came he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesicaste\ra bastard daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet\rhe had gone back to Ilius, and was a great man among the Trojans,\rdwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like honour with his own\rsons. The son of Telamon now struck him under the ear with a spear\rwhich he then drew back again, and Imbrius fell headlong as an ash-tree\rwhen it is felled on the crest of some high mountain beacon, and its\rdelicate green foliage comes toppling down to the ground. Thus did\rhe fall with his bronze-dight armour ringing harshly round him, and\rTeucer sprang forward with intent to strip him of his armour; but\ras he was doing so, Hector took aim at him with a spear. Teucer saw\rthe spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit Amphimachus, son\rof Cteatus son of Actor, in the chest as he was coming into battle,\rand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\rHector sprang forward to take Amphimachus\'s helmet from off his temples,\rand in a moment Ajax threw a spear at him, but did not wound him,\rfor he was encased all over in his terrible armour; nevertheless the\rspear struck the boss of his shield with such force as to drive him\rback from the two corpses, which the Achaeans then drew off. Stichius\rand Menestheus, captains of the Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to\rthe host of the Achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous Ajaxes\rdid the like by Imbrius. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds\rthat have it in their fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high\rabove the ground in their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the\rbody of Imbrius, and strip it of its armour. Then the son of Oileus\rsevered the head from the neck in revenge for the death of Amphimachus,\rand sent it whirling over the crowd as though it had been a ball,\rtill fell in the dust at Hector\'s feet. \r\rNeptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus should\rhave fallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of the Achaeans\rto urge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for the Trojans.\rIdomeneus met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, who had just\rcome to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. His fellow-soldiers\rbore him off the field, and Idomeneus having given orders to the physicians\rwent on to his tent, for he was still thirsting for battle. Neptune\rspoke in the likeness and with the voice of Thoas son of Andraemon\rwho ruled the Aetolians of all Pleuron and high Calydon, and was honoured\ramong his people as though he were a god. "Idomeneus," said he, "lawgiver\rto the Cretans, what has now become of the threats with which the\rsons of the Achaeans used to threaten the Trojans?" \r\rAnd Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, "Thoas, no one, so\rfar as I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are held back\rneither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the of almighty\rJove that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from Argos:\ryou, Thoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart\rif you see any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all\rto do their utmost." \r\rTo this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, "Idomeneus, may\rhe never return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to batten upon,\rwho is this day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armour and go,\rwe must make all haste together if we may be of any use, though we\rare only two. Even cowards gain courage from companionship, and we\rtwo can hold our own with the bravest." \r\rTherewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and Idomeneus\rwhen he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped his two spears,\rand sallied forth. As the lightning which the son of Saturn brandishes\rfrom bright Olympus when he would show a sign to mortals, and its\rgleam flashes far and wide- even so did his armour gleam about him\ras he ran. Meriones his sturdy squire met him while he was still near\rhis tent (for he was going to fetch his spear) and Idomeneus said\r\r"Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you left\rthe field? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurting\ryou? or have you been sent to fetch me? I want no fetching; I had\rfar rather fight than stay in my tent." \r\r"Idomeneus," answered Meriones, "I come for a spear, if I can find\rone in my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it at the\rshield of Deiphobus." \r\rAnd Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, "You will find one\rspear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall\rof my tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for\rI am not one to keep my enemy at arm\'s length; therefore I have spears,\rbossed shields, helmets, and burnished corslets." \r\rThen Meriones said, "I too in my tent and at my ship have spoils taken\rfrom the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at all times\rvalorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held my own\ramong the foremost. There may be those among the Achaeans who do not\rknow how I fight, but you know it well enough yourself."\r\rIdomeneus answered, "I know you for a brave man: you need not tell\rme. If the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush-\rand there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of;\rit comes out then who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will change\rcolour at every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and keeps shifting\rhis weight first on one knee and then on the other; his heart beats\rfast as he thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering of his\rteeth; whereas the brave man will not change colour nor be on finding\rhimself in ambush, but is all the time longing to go into action-\rif the best men were being chosen for such a service, no one could\rmake light of your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struck by\ra dart or smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind, in\ryour neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest or belly\ras you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks. But let\rus no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill spoken\rof; go, fetch your spear from the tent at once." \r\rOn this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself a\rspear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with great\rdeeds of valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to battle, and\rhis son Panic so strong and dauntless goes with him, to strike terror\reven into the heart of a hero- the pair have gone from Thrace to arm\rthemselves among the Ephyri or the brave Phlegyans, but they will\rnot listen to both the contending hosts, and will give victory to\rone side or to the other- even so did Meriones and Idomeneus, captains\rof men, go out to battle clad in their bronze armour. Meriones was\rfirst to speak. "Son of Deucalion," said he, "where would you have\rus begin fighting? On the right wing of the host, in the centre, or\ron the left wing, where I take it the Achaeans will be weakest?"\r\rIdomeneus answered, "There are others to defend the centre- the two\rAjaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the Achaeans, and\ris good also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hector son of\rPriam enough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard to vanquish\rtheir indomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of Saturn\rfling a firebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax son of Telamon\rwill yield to no man who is in mortal mould and eats the grain of\rCeres, if bronze and great stones can overthrow him. He would not\ryield even to Achilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness of\rfoot there is none to beat him; let us turn therefore towards the\rleft wing, that we may know forthwith whether we are to give glory\rto some other, or he to us." \r\rMeriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to the\rpart of the host which Idomeneus had named. \r\rNow when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire,\rhim and his squire clad in their richly wrought armour, they shouted\rand made towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fight\rraged under the ships\' sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistle\rupon a day when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise it\rinto a thick cloud- even such was the fury of the combat, and might\rand main did they hack at each other with spear and sword throughout\rthe host. The field bristled with the long and deadly spears which\rthey bore. Dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their\rfresh-burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they joined\rbattle with one another. Iron indeed must be his courage who could\rtake pleasure in the sight of such a turmoil, and look on it without\rbeing dismayed. \r\rThus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortal heroes.\rJove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and to Hector, so as\rto do honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he did not mean to utterly\roverthrow the Achaean host before Ilius, and only wanted to glorify\rThetis and her valiant son. Neptune on the other hand went about among\rthe Argives to incite them, having come up from the grey sea in secret,\rfor he was grieved at seeing them vanquished by the Trojans, and was\rfuriously angry with Jove. Both were of the same race and country,\rbut Jove was elder born and knew more, therefore Neptune feared to\rdefend the Argives openly, but in the likeness of man, he kept on\rencouraging them throughout their host. Thus, then, did these two\rdevise a knot of war and battle, that none could unloose or break,\rand set both sides tugging at it, to the failing of men\'s knees beneath\rthem. \r\rAnd now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,\rcalled loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as he\rleaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a sojourner,\rwho had but lately come to take part in the war. He sought Cassandra\rthe fairest of Priam\'s daughters in marriage, but offered no gifts\rof wooing, for he promised a great thing, to wit, that he would drive\rthe sons of the Achaeans willy nilly from Troy; old King Priam had\rgiven his consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought on the\rstrength of the promises thus made to him. Idomeneus aimed a spear,\rand hit him as he came striding on. His cuirass of bronze did not\rprotect him, and the spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell heavily\rto the ground. Then Idomeneus vaunted over him saying, "Othryoneus,\rthere is no one in the world whom I shall admire more than I do you,\rif you indeed perform what you have promised Priam son of Dardanus\rin return for his daughter. We too will make you an offer; we will\rgive you the loveliest daughter of the son of Atreus, and will bring\rher from Argos for you to marry, if you will sack the goodly city\rof Ilius in company with ourselves; so come along with me, that we\rmay make a covenant at the ships about the marriage, and we will not\rbe hard upon you about gifts of wooing." \r\rWith this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thick\rof the fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on foot, in front\rof his horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that he\rcould feel their \'breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strike\rdown Idomeneus, but ere he could do so Idomeneus smote him with his\rspear in the throat under the chin, and the bronze point went clean\rthrough it. He fell as an oak, or poplar, or pine which shipwrights\rhave felled for ship\'s timber upon the mountains with whetted axes-\reven thus did he lie full length in front of his chariot and horses,\rgrinding his teeth and clutching at the bloodstained just. His charioteer\rwas struck with panic and did not dare turn his horses round and escape:\rthereupon Antilochus hit him in the middle of his body with a spear;\rhis cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and the spear stuck in\rhis belly. He fell gasping from his chariot and Antilochus great Nestor\'s\rson, drove his horses from the Trojans to the Achaeans. \r\rDeiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, and took\raim at him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out and avoided\rit, for he was covered by the round shield he always bore- a shield\rof oxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. He crouched\runder cover of this, and the spear flew over him, but the shield rang\rout as the spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not in vain from the\rstrong hand of Deiphobus, for it struck Hypsenor son of Hippasus,\rshepherd of his people, in the liver under the midriff, and his limbs\rfailed beneath him. Deiphobus vaunted over him and cried with a loud\rvoice saying, "Of a truth Asius has not fallen unavenied; he will\rbe glad even while passing into the house of Hades, strong warden\rof the gate, that I have sent some one to escort him." \r\rThus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying. Noble\rAntilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not make him\rforget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, and\rcovered him with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades, Mecisteus\rson of Echius, and Alastor stooped down, and bore him away groaning\rheavily to the ships. But Idomeneus ceased not his fury. He kept on\rstriving continually either to enshroud some Trojan in the darkness\rof death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil day from the\rAchaeans. Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes: he was son-in-law\rto Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia who was\rthe darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her generation\rin beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, wherefore the bravest\rman in all Troy had taken her to wife- him did Neptune lay low by\rthe hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding his strong\rlimbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to one side,\rbut stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus struck\rhim with a spear in the middle of his chest. The coat of mail that\rhad hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rang harshly as\rthe spear tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground, and the\rspear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the butt-end\rof the spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life. Idomeneus\rvaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying, "Deiphobus, since\ryou are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits now that we have killed\rthree men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fight with me yourself,\rthat you may learn what manner of Jove-begotten man am I that have\rcome hither. Jove first begot Minos chief ruler in Crete, and Minos\rin his turn begot a son, noble Deucalion; Deucalion begot me to be\ra ruler over many men in Crete, and my ships have now brought me hither,\rto be the bane of yourself, your father, and the Trojans."\r\rThus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go back\rand fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up the challenge\rsingle-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetch Aeneas,\rwhom he found standing in the rear, for he had long been aggrieved\rwith Priam because in spite his brave deeds he did not give him his\rdue share of honour. Deiphobus went up to him and said, "Aeneas, prince\ramong the Trojans, if you know any ties of kinship, help me now to\rdefend the body of your sister\'s husband; come with me to the rescue\rof Alcathous, who being husband to your sister brought you up when\ryou were a child in his house, and now Idomeneus has slain him."\r\rWith these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in pursuit\rof Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but Idomeneus was not\rto be thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held his ground\ras a wild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the coming of\ra great crowd of men in some lonely place- the bristles stand upright\ron his back, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness\rto defend himself against hounds and men- even so did famed Idomeneus\rhold his ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas. He cried aloud\rto his comrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus, Deipyrus, Meriones,\rand Antilochus, all of them brave soldiers- "Hither my friends," he\rcried, "and leave me not single-handed- I go in great fear by fleet\rAeneas, who is coming against me, and is a redoubtable dispenser of\rdeath battle. Moreover he is in the flower of youth when a man\'s strength\ris greatest; if I was of the same age as he is and in my present mind,\reither he or I should soon bear away the prize of victory\r\rOn this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on shoulder.\rAeneas on the other side called to his comrades, looking towards Deiphobus,\rParis, and Agenor, who were leaders of the Trojans along with himself,\rand the people followed them as sheep follow the ram when they go\rdown to drink after they have been feeding, and the heart of the shepherd\ris glad- even so was the heart of Aeneas gladdened when he saw his\rpeople follow him. \r\rThen they fought furiously in close combat about the body of Alcathous,\rwielding their long spears; and the bronze armour about their bodies\rrang fearfully as they took aim at one another in the press of the\rfight, while the two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peers of Mars, outxied\revery one in their desire to hack at each other with sword and spear.\rAeneas took aim first, but Idomeneus was on the lookout and avoided\rthe spear, so that it sped from Aeneas\' strong hand in vain, and fell\rquivering in the ground. Idomeneus meanwhile smote Oenomaus in the\rmiddle of his belly, and broke the plate of his corslet, whereon his\rbowels came gushing out and he clutched the earth in the palms of\rhis hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. Idomeneus drew his spear\rout of the body, but could not strip him of the rest of his armour\rfor the rain of darts that were showered upon him: moreover his strength\rwas now beginning to fail him so that he could no longer charge, and\rcould neither spring forward to recover his own weapon nor swerve\raside to avoid one that was aimed at him; therefore, though he still\rdefended himself in hand-to-hand fight, his heavy feet could not bear\rhim swiftly out of the battle. Deiphobus aimed a spear at him as he\rwas retreating slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him\rwas as fierce as ever, but again he missed him, and hit Ascalaphus,\rthe son of Mars; the spear went through his shoulder, and he clutched\rthe earth in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.\r\rGrim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen,\rfor he was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the golden clouds,\rby command of Jove, where the other gods were also sitting, forbidden\rto take part in the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiously about the\rbody. Deiphobus tore the helmet from off his head, but Meriones sprang\rupon him, and struck him on the arm with a spear so that the visored\rhelmet fell from his hand and came ringing down upon the ground. Thereon\rMeriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drew the spear from his shoulder,\rand fell back under cover of his men. Then Polites, own brother of\rDeiphobus passed his arms around his waist, and bore him away from\rthe battle till he got to his horses that were standing in the rear\rof the fight with the chariot and their driver. These took him towards\rthe city groaning and in great pain, with the blood flowing from his\rarm. \r\rThe others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven without\rceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, and struck him\rwith a spear in his throat which was turned towards him; his head\rfell on one side, his helmet and shield came down along with him,\rand death, life\'s foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spied his chance,\rflew forward towards Thoon, and wounded him as he was turning round.\rHe laid open the vein that runs all the way up the back to the neck;\rhe cut this vein clean away throughout its whole course, and Thoon\rfell in the dust face upwards, stretching out his hands imploringly\rtowards his comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him and stripped the\rarmour from his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so.\rThe Trojans came about him on every side and struck his broad and\rgleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for Neptune stood guard\rover the son of Nestor, though the darts fell thickly round him. He\rwas never clear of the foe, but was always in the thick of the fight;\rhis spear was never idle; he poised and aimed it in every direction,\rso eager was he to hit some one from a distance or to fight him hand\rto hand. \r\rAs he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas son of\rAsius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in the middle\rof his shield, but Neptune made its point without effect, for he grudged\rhim the life of Antilochus. One half, therefore, of the spear stuck\rfast like a charred stake in Antilochus\'s shield, while the other\rlay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of his men,\rbut Meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midway between\rthe private parts and the navel, where a wound is particualrly painful\rto wretched mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and he writhed\rconvulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain herdsmen have\rbound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce. Even so did\rhe move convulsively for a while, but not for very long, till Meriones\rcame up and drew the spear out of his body, and his eyes were veiled\rin darkness. \r\rHelenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting\rhim on the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his\rhead; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were fighting\ron the Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at his feet, but\rthe eyes of Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.\r\rOn this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus,\rbrandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the two attacked\rone another at one and the same moment, the one with his spear, and\rthe other with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hit the breastplate\rof Menelaus\'s corslet, but the arrow glanced from off it. As black\rbeans or pulse come pattering down on to a threshing-floor from the\rbroad winnowing-shovel, blown by shrill winds and shaken by the shovel-\reven so did the arrow glance off and recoil from the shield of Menelaus,\rwho in his turn wounded the hand with which Helenus carried his bow;\rthe spear went right through his hand and stuck in the bow itself,\rso that to his life he retreated under cover of his men, with his\rhand dragging by his side- for the spear weighed it down till Agenor\rdrew it out and bound the hand carefully up in a woollen sling which\rhis esquire had with him. \r\rPisander then made straight at Menelaus- his evil destiny luring him\ron to his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O Menelaus.\rWhen the two were hard by one another the spear of the son of Atreus\rturned aside and he missed his aim; Pisander then struck the shield\rof brave Menelaus but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed the\rspear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure\rof victory; forthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword and\rsprang upon him. Pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, with\rits long and polished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under\rhis shield, and the two made at one another. Pisander struck the peak\rof Menelaus\'s crested helmet just under the crest itself, and Menelaus\rhit Pisander as he was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at\rthe rise of his nose; the bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled\reyes fell by his feet in the dust. He fell backwards to the ground,\rand Menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and\rvaunted over him saying, "Even thus shall you Trojans leave the ships\rof the Achaeans, proud and insatiate of battle though you be: nor\rshall you lack any of the disgrace and shame which you have heaped\rupon myself. Cowardly she-wolves that you are, you feared not the\ranger of dread Jove, avenger of violated hospitality, who will one\rday destroy your city; you stole my wedded wife and wickedly carried\roff much treasure when you were her guest, and now you would fling\rfire upon our ships, and kill our heroes. A day will come when, rage\ras you may, you shall be stayed. O father Jove, you, who they say\rart above all both gods and men in wisdom, and from whom all things\rthat befall us do proceed, how can you thus favour the Trojans- men\rso proud and overweening, that they are never tired of fighting? All\rthings pall after a while- sleep, love, sweet song, and stately dance-\rstill these are things of which a man would surely have his fill rather\rthan of battle, whereas it is of battle that the Trojans are insatiate."\r\rSo saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the body\rof Pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again ranged himself\ramong those who were in the front of the fight. \r\rHarpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had come\rto fight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go home again.\rHe struck the middle of Menelaus\'s shield with his spear but could\rnot pierce it, and to save his life drew back under cover of his men,\rlooking round him on every side lest he should be wounded. But Meriones\raimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving the field, and\rhit him on the right buttock; the arrow pierced the bone through and\rthrough, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat down where he was and\rbreathed his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched like a worm\rupon the ground and watering the earth with the blood that flowed\rfrom his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all due care;\rthey raised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the city\rof Troy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but there\rwas no ransom that could bring his dead son to life again.\r\rParis was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his host\rwhen he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore,\rin order to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor,\rson of Polyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was\rin Corinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that\rit would be the death of him, for his good old father Polyidus had\roften told him that he must either stay at home and die of a terrible\rdisease, or go with the Achaeans and perish at the hands of the Trojans;\rhe chose, therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the Achaeans\rwould have laid upon him, and at the same time to escape the pain\rand suffering of disease. Paris now smote him on the jaw under his\rear, whereon the life went out of him and he was enshrouded in the\rdarkness of death. \r\rThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector had\rnot yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making havoc\rof his men on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere\rlong would have triumphed over them, so vigorously did Neptune cheer\rthem on and help them. He therefore held on at the point where he\rhad first forced his way through the gates and the wall, after breaking\rthrough the serried ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that the\rships of Ajax and Protesilaus were drawn up by the sea-shore; here\rthe wall was at its lowest, and the fight both of man and horse raged\rmost fiercely. The Boeotians and the Ionians with their long tunics,\rthe Locrians, the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans\rcould hardly stay Hector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could\rthey drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. The chosen\rmen of the Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus son of Peteos,\rwith whom were also Pheidas, Stichius, and stalwart Bias: Meges son\rof Phyleus, Amphion, and Dracius commanded the Epeans, while Medon\rand staunch Podarces led the men of Phthia. Of these, Medon was bastard\rson to Oileus and brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from\rhis own country, for he had killed the brother of his stepmother Eriopis,\rthe wife of Oileus; the other, Podarces, was the son of Iphiclus son\rof Phylacus. These two stood in the van of the Phthians, and defended\rthe ships along with the Boeotians. \r\rAjax son of Oileus never for a moment left the side of Ajax son of\rTelamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the plough\rwhich they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat steams upwards\rfrom about the roots of their horns- nothing but the yoke divides\rthem as they break up the ground till they reach the end of the field-\reven so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to shoulder by one another.\rMany and brave comrades followed the son of Telamon, to relieve him\rof his shield when he was overcome with sweat and toil, but the Locrians\rdid not follow so close after the son of Oileus, for they could not\rhold their own in a hand-to-hand fight. They had no bronze helmets\rwith plumes of horse-hair, neither had they shields nor ashen spears,\rbut they had come to Troy armed with bows, and with slings of twisted\rwool from which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of\rthe Trojans. The others, therefore, with their heavy armour bore the\rbrunt of the fight with the Trojans and with Hector, while the Locrians\rshot from behind, under their cover; and thus the Trojans began to\rlose heart, for the arrows threw them into confusion. \r\rThe Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the ships\rand tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presently said to\rHector, "Hector, there is no persuading you to take advice. Because\rheaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of war, you think that\ryou must therefore excel others in counsel; but you cannot thus claim\rpreeminence in all things. Heaven has made one man an excellent soldier;\rof another it has made a dancer or a singer and player on the lyre;\rwhile yet in another Jove has implanted a wise understanding of which\rmen reap fruit to the saving of many, and he himself knows more about\rit than any one; therefore I will say what I think will be best. The\rfight has hemmed you in as with a circle of fire, and even now that\rthe Trojans are within the wall some of them stand aloof in full armour,\rwhile others are fighting scattered and outnumbered near the ships.\rDraw back, therefore, and call your chieftains round you, that we\rmay advise together whether to fall now upon the ships in the hope\rthat heaven may vouchsafe us victory, or to beat a retreat while we\rcan yet safely do so. I greatly fear that the Achaeans will pay us\rtheir debt of yesterday in full, for there is one abiding at their\rships who is never weary of battle, and who will not hold aloof much\rlonger." \r\rThus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He sprang\rin full armour from his chariot and said, "Polydamas, gather the chieftains\rhere; I will go yonder into the fight, but will return at once when\rI have given them their orders." \r\rHe then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a loud\rcry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies. When they\rheard his voice they all hastened to gather round Polydamas the excellent\rson of Panthous, but Hector kept on among the foremost, looking everywhere\rto find Deiphobus and prince Helenus, Adamas son of Asius, and Asius\rson of Hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless he could no longer\rfind them, for the two last were lying by the sterns of the Achaean\rships, slain by the Argives, while the others had been also stricken\rand wounded by them; but upon the left wing of the dread battle he\rfound Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, cheering his men and urging\rthem on to fight. He went up to him and upbraided him. "Paris," said\rhe, "evil-hearted Paris, fair to see but woman-mad and false of tongue,\rwhere are Deiphobus and King Helenus? Where are Adamas son of Asius,\rand Asius son of Hyrtacus? Where too is Othryoneus? Ilius is undone\rand will now surely fall!" \r\rAlexandrus answered, "Hector, why find fault when there is no one\rto find fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day rather\rthan this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about\rme. From the moment when you set our men fighting about the ships\rwe have been staying here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our comrades\rabout whom you ask me are dead; Deiphobus and King Helenus alone have\rleft the field, wounded both of them in the hand, but the son of Saturn\rsaved them alive. Now, therefore, lead on where you would have us\rgo, and we will follow with right goodwill; you shall not find us\rfail you in so far as our strength holds out, but no man can do more\rthan in him lies, no matter how willing he may be." \r\rWith these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went towards\rthe part of the battle where the fight was thickest, about Cebriones,\rbrave Polydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike Polyphetes, Palmys, Ascanius,\rand Morys son of Hippotion, who had come from fertile Ascania on the\rpreceding day to relieve other troops. Then Jove urged them on to\rfight. They flew forth like the blasts of some fierce wind that strike\rearth in the van of a thunderstorm- they buffet the salt sea into\ran uproar; many and mighty are the great waves that come crashing\rin one after the other upon the shore with their arching heads all\rcrested with foam- even so did rank behind rank of Trojans arrayed\rin gleaming armour follow their leaders onward. The way was led by\rHector son of Priam, peer of murderous Mars, with his round shield\rbefore him- his shield of ox-hides covered with plates of bronze-\rand his gleaming helmet upon his temples. He kept stepping forward\runder cover of his shield in every direction, making trial of the\rranks to see if they would give way be him, but he could not daunt\rthe courage of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first to stride out and\rchallenge him. "Sir," he cried, "draw near; why do you think thus\rvainly to dismay the Argives? We Achaeans are excellent soldiers,\rbut the scourge of Jove has fallen heavily upon us. Your heart, forsooth,\ris set on destroying our ships, but we too have bands that can keep\ryou at bay, and your own fair town shall be sooner taken and sacked\rby ourselves. The time is near when you shall pray Jove and all the\rgods in your flight, that your steeds may be swifter than hawks as\rthey raise the dust on the plain and bear you back to your city."\r\rAs he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and the\rhost of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. But\rHector answered, "Ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that I\rwere as sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing Jove, with\rQueen Juno for my mother, and of being held in like honour with Minerva\rand Apollo, as I am that this day is big with the destruction of the\rAchaeans; and you shall fall among them if you dare abide my spear;\rit shall rend your fair body and bid you glut our hounds and birds\rof prey with your fat and your flesh, as you fall by the ships of\rthe Achaeans." \r\rWith these words he led the way and the others followed after with\ra cry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them. The Argives\ron their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget their prowess,\rbut stood firm against the onslaught of the Trojan chieftains, and\rthe cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and to the brightness\rof Jove\'s presence. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XIV\r\rNestor was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not escape\rhim, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, "What, noble Machaon,\ris the meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by our ships\rgrow stronger and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit over your\rwine, while fair Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clotted\rblood from off you. I will go at once to the look-out station and\rsee what it is all about." \r\rAs he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was\rlying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had taken\rhis father\'s shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear,\rand as soon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans\rwho, now that their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before\rthe Trojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the\rwaves are dumb- they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter\rwhence the fierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where\rthey are and set neither this way nor that, till some particular wind\rsweeps down from heaven to determine them- even so did the old man\rponder whether to make for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search of\rAgamemnon. In the end he deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus;\rbut meanwhile the hosts were fighting and killing one another, and\rthe hard bronze rattled on their bodies, as they thrust at one another\rwith their swords and spears. \r\rThe wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son of\rAtreus, fell in Nestor as they were coming up from their ships- for\rtheirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was going on,\rbeing on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached first,\rwhile the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch of\rthe shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all the ships,\rand the host was cramped for space, therefore they had placed the\rships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the whole opening\rof the bay between the two points that formed it. The kings, leaning\ron their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being in great\ranxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled with dismay.\rThen King Agamemnon said to him, "Nestor son of Neleus, honour to\rthe Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? I fear\rthat what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted among\rthe Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had fired\rour ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is all coming\rtrue. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles, are in anger with\rme that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships."\r\rThen Nestor knight of Gerene answered, "It is indeed as you say; it\ris all coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thunders from\ron high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we relied as\ran impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. The Trojans are\rfighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look where you\rmay you cannot see from what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming;\rthey are being killed in a confused mass and the battle-cry ascends\rto heaven; let us think, if counsel can be of any use, what we had\rbetter do; but I do not advise our going into battle ourselves, for\ra man cannot fight when he is wounded." \r\rAnd King Agamemnon answered, "Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed fighting\rat the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench has\rserved us- over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they deemed\rwould be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet- I see it\rmust be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously\rhere, far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing to defend us, and\rI know now that he is raising the Trojans to like honour with the\rgods, while us, on the other hand, he bas bound hand and foot. Now,\rtherefore, let us all do as I say; let us bring down the ships that\rare on the beach and draw them into the water; let us make them fast\rto their mooring-stones a little way out, against the fall of night-\rif even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting; we may then\rdraw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong in flying\rruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should fly and\rbe saved than be caught and killed." \r\rUlysses looked fiercely at him and said, "Son of Atreus, what are\ryou talking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other and\rbaser army, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted a\rlife of hard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of\rus perish. Is it thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win\rwhich we have suffered so much hardship? Hold your peace, lest some\rother of the Achaeans hear you say what no man who knows how to give\rgood counsel, no king over so great a host as that of the Argives\rshould ever have let fall from his lips. I despise your judgement\rutterly for what you have been saying. Would you, then, have us draw\rdown our ships into the water while the battle is raging, and thus\rplay further into the hands of the conquering Trojans? It would be\rruin; the Achaeans will not go on fighting when they see the ships\rbeing drawn into the water, but will cease attacking and keep turning\rtheir eyes towards them; your counsel, therefore, Sir captain, would\rbe our destruction." \r\rAgamemnon answered, "Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart.\rI am not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships into\rthe sea whether they will or no. Some one, it may be, old or young,\rcan offer us better counsel which I shall rejoice to hear."\r\rThen said Diomed, "Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek,\rif you will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am younger\rthan any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who\rlies buried at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom,\rAgrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third was\rthe knight Oeneus, my father\'s father, and he was the most valiant\rof them all. Oeeneus remained in his own country, but my father (as\rJove and the other gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He married\rinto the family of Adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance,\rfor he had large estates of rich corn-growing land, with much orchard\rground as well, and he had many sheep; moreover he excelled all the\rArgives in the use of the spear. You must yourselves have heard whether\rthese things are true or no; therefore when I say well despise not\rmy words as though I were a coward or of ignoble birth. I say, then,\rlet us go to the fight as we needs must, wounded though we be. When\rthere, we may keep out of the battle and beyond the range of the spears\rlest we get fresh wounds in addition to what we have already, but\rwe can spur on others, who have been indulging their spleen and holding\raloof from battle hitherto." \r\rThus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out,\rKing Agamemnon leading the way. \r\rMeanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them\rin the semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon\'s right hand in\rhis own and said, "Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that\rhe sees the Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse-\rmay he come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself,\rthe blessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the\rprinces and counsellors of the Trojans shall again raise the dust\rupon the plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tents\rtowards their city." \r\rWith this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to the\rplain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nine\ror ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight,\rand it put fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage war\rand do battle without ceasing. \r\rJuno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of\rOlympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was at\ronce her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither\ramid the fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on the\rtopmost crests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She set herself\rto think how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemed that\rit would be best for her to go to Ida and array herself in rich attire,\rin the hope that Jove might become enamoured of her, and wish to embrace\rher. While he was thus engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be\rmade to steal over his eyes and senses. \r\rShe went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made her,\rand the doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of a secret\rkey so that no other god could open them. Here she entered and closed\rthe doors behind her. She cleansed all the dirt from her fair body\rwith ambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil, ambrosial,\rvery soft, and scented specially for herself- if it were so much as\rshaken in the bronze-floored house of Jove, the scent pervaded the\runiverse of heaven and earth. With this she anointed her delicate\rskin, and then she plaited the fair ambrosial locks that flowed in\ra stream of golden tresses from her immortal head. She put on the\rwondrous robe which Minerva had worked for her with consummate art,\rand had embroidered with manifold devices; she fastened it about her\rbosom with golden clasps, and she girded herself with a girdle that\rhad a hundred tassels: then she fastened her earrings, three brilliant\rpendants that glistened most beautifully, through the pierced lobes\rof her ears, and threw a lovely new veil over her head. She bound\rher sandals on to her feet, and when she had arrayed herself perfectly\rto her satisfaction, she left her room and called Venus to come aside\rand speak to her. "My dear child," said she, "will you do what I am\rgoing to ask of you, or will refuse me because you are angry at my\rbeing on the Danaan side, while you are on the Trojan?" \r\rJove\'s daughter Venus answered, "Juno, august queen of goddesses,\rdaughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it for\rat once, if I can, and if it can be done at all." \r\rThen Juno told her a lying tale and said, "I want you to endow me\rwith some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring all\rthings mortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world\'s\rend to visit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys:\rthey received me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up,\rhaving taken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn\rin the depths that are under earth and sea. I must go and see them\rthat I may make peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and\rare so angry that they have not slept with one another this long while;\rif I can bring them round and restore them to one another\'s embraces,\rthey will be grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards."\r\rThereon laughter-loving Venus said, "I cannot and must not refuse\ryou, for you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king."\r\rAs she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered girdle\rinto which all her charms had been wrought- love, desire, and that\rsweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the most prudent.\rShe gave the girdle to Juno and said, "Take this girdle wherein all\rmy charms reside and lay it in your bosom. If you will wear it I promise\ryou that your errand, be it what it may, will not be bootless."\r\rWhen she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the girdle\rin her bosom. \r\rVenus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted down\rfrom the summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair Emathia,\rand went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of the Thracian\rhorsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without ever setting\rfoot to ground. When she came to Athos she went on over the, waves\rof the sea till she reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas. There\rshe met Sleep, own brother to Death, and caught him by the hand, saying,\r"Sleep, you who lord it alike over mortals and immortals, if you ever\rdid me a service in times past, do one for me now, and I shall be\rgrateful to you ever after. Close Jove\'s keen eyes for me in slumber\rwhile I hold him clasped in my embrace, and I will give you a beautiful\rgolden seat, that can never fall to pieces; my clubfooted son Vulcan\rshall make it for you, and he shall give it a footstool for you to\rrest your fair feet upon when you are at table." \r\rThen Sleep answered, "Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of\rmighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep without\rcompunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all\rof them proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleep\runless he bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing what\ryou asked me, on the day when Jove\'s mighty son Hercules set sail\rfrom Ilius after having sacked the city of the Trojans. At your bidding\rI suffused my sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and\rlaid him to rest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and\rset the blasts of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took\rhim to the goodly city of Cos away from all his friends. Jove was\rfurious when he awoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the\rhouse; he was looking more particularly for myself, and would have\rflung me down through space into the sea where I should never have\rbeen heard of any more, had not Night who cows both men and gods protected\rme. I fled to her and Jove left off looking for me in spite of his\rbeing so angry, for he did not dare do anything to displease Night.\rAnd now you are again asking me to do something on which I cannot\rventure." \r\rAnd Juno said, "Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into\ryour head? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans,\ras he was about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of the\ryoungest of the Graces, and she shall be your own- Pasithea, whom\ryou have always wanted to marry." \r\rSleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, "Then swear it\rto me by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on the bounteous\rearth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that all the gods\rwho dwell down below with Saturn may be our witnesses, and see that\ryou really do give me one of the youngest of the Graces- Pasithea,\rwhom I have always wanted to marry." \r\rJuno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of the\rnether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she had completed\rher oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist and sped lightly\rforward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them. Presently they reached\rmany-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and Lectum where they\rleft the sea to go on by land, and the tops of the trees of the forest\rsoughed under the going of their feet. Here Sleep halted, and ere\rJove caught sight of him he climbed a lofty pine-tree- the tallest\rthat reared its head towards heaven on all Ida. He hid himself behind\rthe branches and sat there in the semblance of the sweet-singing bird\rthat haunts the mountains and is called Chalcis by the gods, but men\rcall it Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, the topmost peak of\rIda, and Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon her. As soon as\rhe did so he became inflamed with the same passionate desire for her\rthat he had felt when they had first enjoyed each other\'s embraces,\rand slept with one another without their dear parents knowing anything\rabout it. He went up to her and said, "What do you want that you have\rcome hither from Olympus- and that too with neither chariot nor horses\rto convey you?" \r\rThen Juno told him a lying tale and said, "I am going to the world\'s\rend, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and mother Tethys;\rthey received me into their house, took care of me, and brought me\rup. I must go and see them that I may make peace between them: they\rhave been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not slept with\rone another this long time. The horses that will take me over land\rand sea are stationed on the lowermost spurs of many-fountained Ida,\rand I have come here from Olympus on purpose to consult you. I was\rafraid you might be angry with me later on, if I went to the house\rof Oceanus without letting you know." \r\rAnd Jove said, "Juno, you can choose some other time for paying your\rvisit to Oceanus- for the present let us devote ourselves to love\rand to the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been so overpowered\rby passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am at this moment\rfor yourself- not even when I was in love with the wife of Ixion who\rbore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with Danae the\rdaintily-ancled daughter of Acrisius, who bore me the famed hero Perseus.\rThen there was the daughter of Phoenix, who bore me Minos and Rhadamanthus:\rthere was Semele, and Alcmena in Thebes by whom I begot my lion-hearted\rson Hercules, while Semele became mother to Bacchus the comforter\rof mankind. There was queen Ceres again, and lovely Leto, and yourself-\rbut with none of these was I ever so much enamoured as I now am with\ryou." \r\rJuno again answered him with a lying tale. "Most dread son of Saturn,"\rshe exclaimed, "what are you talking about? Would you have us enjoy\rone another here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything can be\rseen? What if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleeping together,\rand tell the others? It would be such a scandal that when I had risen\rfrom your embraces I could never show myself inside your house again;\rbut if you are so minded, there is a room which your son Vulcan has\rmade me, and he has given it good strong doors; if you would so have\rit, let us go thither and lie down." \r\rAnd Jove answered, "Juno, you need not be afraid that either god or\rman will see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a dense golden\rcloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams shall not\rsee through it." \r\rWith this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace; whereon\rthe earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with dew-bespangled\rlotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that it raised them\rwell above the ground. Here they laid themselves down and overhead\rthey were covered by a fair cloud of gold, from which there fell glittering\rdew-drops. \r\rThus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the crest\rof Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his spouse\rin his arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the Achaeans,\rto tell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the earthquake. When he\rhad found him he said, "Now, Neptune, you can help the Danaans with\ra will, and give them victory though it be only for a short time while\rJove is still sleeping. I have sent him into a sweet slumber, and\rJuno has beguiled him into going to bed with her." \r\rSleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind, leaving\rNeptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He darted forward\ramong the first ranks and shouted saying, "Argives, shall we let Hector\rson of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships and covering himself\rwith glory? This is what he says that he shall now do, seeing that\rAchilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; We shall get on very well\rwithout him if we keep each other in heart and stand by one another.\rNow, therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us each take the best\rand largest shield we can lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally\rforth with our longest spears in our hands; will lead you on, and\rHector son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold out against\rus. If any good staunch soldier has only a small shield, let him hand\rit over to a worse man, and take a larger one for himself."\r\rThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of Tydeus,\rUlysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the others in\rarray, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges of armour;\rthe most valiant took the best armour, and gave the worse to the worse\rman. When they had donned their bronze armour they marched on with\rNeptune at their head. In his strong hand he grasped his terrible\rsword, keen of edge and flashing like lightning; woe to him who comes\racross it in the day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away\rfrom it. \r\rHector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptune\rand Hector waged fierce war on one another- Hector on the Trojan and\rNeptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forces\rmet; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and tents of the Achaeans,\rbut waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly when driven before\rthe blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forest fire roar more\rfiercely when it is well alight upon the mountains, nor does the wind\rbellow with ruder music as it tears on through the tops of when it\ris blowing its hardest, than the terrible shout which the Trojans\rand Achaeans raised as they sprang upon one another. \r\rHector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards\rhim, nor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two bands\rpassed over his chest- the band of his shield and that of his silver-studded\rsword- and these protected his body. Hector was angry that his spear\rshould have been hurled in vain, and withdrew under cover of his men.\rAs he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamon struck him with a stone,\rof which there were many lying about under the men\'s feet as they\rfought- brought there to give support to the ships\' sides as they\rlay on the shore. Ajax caught up one of them and struck Hector above\rthe rim of his shield close to his neck; the blow made him spin round\rlike a top and reel in all directions. As an oak falls headlong when\ruprooted by the lightning flash of father Jove, and there is a terrible\rsmell of brimstone- no man can help being dismayed if he is standing\rnear it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing- even so did Hector\rfall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell from his hand, but\rhis shield and helmet were made fast about his body, and his bronze\rarmour rang about him. \r\rThe sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him,\rhoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans,\rbut none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and covered\rby the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captain of the\rLycians, and noble Glaucus: of the others, too, there was not one\rwho was unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over him\rto cover him. His comrades then lifted him off the ground and bore\rhim away from the battle to the place where his horses stood waiting\rfor him at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot;\rthese then took him towards the city groaning and in great pain. When\rthey reached the ford of the air stream of Xanthus, begotten of Immortal\rJove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on the\rground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathed\ragain and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomited blood,\rbut soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were again closed\rin darkness for he was still sturined by the blow. \r\rWhen the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart and\rset upon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of Oileus\rbegan by springing on Satnius son of Enops and wounding him with his\rspear: a fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as he was herding\rcattle by the banks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus came\rup to him and struck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce\rfight between Trojans and Danaans raged round his body. Polydamas\rson of Panthous drew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor son\rof Areilycus on the right shoulder; the terrible spear went right\rthrough his shoulder, and he clutched the earth as he fell in the\rdust. Polydamas vaunted loudly over him saying, "Again I take it that\rthe spear has not sped in vain from the strong hand of the son of\rPanthous; an Argive has caught it in his body, and it will serve him\rfor a staff as he goes down into the house of Hades." \r\rThe Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon was\rmore angry than any, for the man had fallen close be, him; so he aimed\rat Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself by\rswerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, for\rheaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where the head springs\rfrom the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severed both the\rtendons at the back of the head. His head, mouth, and nostrils reached\rthe ground long before his legs and knees could do so, and Ajax shouted\rto Polydamas saying, "Think, Polydamas, and tell me truly whether\rthis man is not as well worth killing as Prothoenor was: he seems\rrich, and of rich family, a brother, it may be, or son of the knight\rAntenor, for he is very like him." \r\rBut he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered.\rAcamas then bestrode his brother\'s body and wounded Promachus the\rBoeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother\'s body\raway. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying, "Argive archers, braggarts\rthat you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only, but some\rof you too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See how Promachus\rnow sleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother\'s blood\rhas not long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he\rleaves a kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall."\r\rHis taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged than\rany of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not stand his\rground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-master Phorbas,\rwhom Mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealth than any\rother of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleos now\rwounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball from\rits socket: the spear went right through the eye into the nape of\rthe neck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him. Peneleos\rthen drew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and\rhelmet came tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking\rin the eye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a poppy-head,\rand showed it to the Trojans, vaunting over them as he did so. "Trojans,"\rhe cried, "bid the father and mother of noble Ilioneus make moan for\rhim in their house, for the wife also of Promachus son of Alegenor\rwill never be gladdened by the coming of her dear husband- when we\rArgives return with our ships from Troy." \r\rAs he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about\rto see whither he might fly for safety. \r\rTell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of the\rArgives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord of the\rearthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was\rfirst to wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians.\rAntilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew Morys\rand Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The son\rof Atreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in the flank,\rand the bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among\rthem; on this his life came hurrying out of him at the place where\rhe had been wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son\rof Oileus killed more than any other, for there was no man so fleet\ras he to pursue flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.\r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XV\r\rBut when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set\rstakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the Trojans\rmade a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear.\rJove now woke on the crests of Ida, where he was lying with golden-throned\rJuno by his side, and starting to his feet he saw the Trojans and\rAchaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the others driving them\rpell-mell before them with King Neptune in their midst. He saw Hector\rlying on the ground with his comrades gathered round him, gasping\rfor breath, wandering in mind and vomiting blood, for it was not the\rfeeblest of the Achaeans who struck him. \r\rThe sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on Juno.\r"I see, Juno," said he, "you mischief- making trickster, that your\rcunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the rout of\rhis host. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you will\rbe the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you not\rremember how once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened two anvils\ron to your feet, and bound your hands in a chain of gold which none\rmight break, and you hung in mid-air among the clouds. All the gods\rin Olympus were in a fury, but they could not reach you to set you\rfree; when I caught any one of them I gripped him and hurled him from\rthe heavenly threshold till he came fainting down to earth; yet even\rthis did not relieve my mind from the incessant anxiety which I felt\rabout noble Hercules whom you and Boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond\rthe seas to Cos, after suborning the tempests; but I rescued him,\rand notwithstanding all his mighty labours I brought him back again\rto Argos. I would remind you of this that you may learn to leave off\rbeing so deceitful, and discover how much you are likely to gain by\rthe embraces out of which you have come here to trick me."\r\rJuno trembled as he spoke, and said, "May heaven above and earth below\rbe my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx- and this is the\rmost solemn oath that a blessed god can take- nay, I swear also by\ryour own almighty head and by our bridal bed- things over which I\rcould never possibly perjure myself- that Neptune is not punishing\rHector and the Trojans and helping the Achaeans through any doing\rof mine; it is all of his own mere motion because he was sorry to\rsee the Achaeans hard pressed at their ships: if I were advising him,\rI should tell him to do as you bid him." \r\rThe sire of gods and men smiled and answered, "If you, Juno, were\ralways to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune,\rlike it or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking.\rIf, then, you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among\rthe rank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of the\rbow, that I want them- Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and\rtell Neptune to leave off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he\rmay send Hector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he\rwill thus forget his present sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back\rin confusion till they fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus.\rAchilles will then send his comrade Patroclus into battle, and Hector\rwill kill him in front of Ilius after he has slain many warriors,\rand among them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will kill Hector\rto avenge Patroclus, and from that time I will bring it about that\rthe Achaeans shall persistently drive the Trojans back till they fulfil\rthe counsels of Minerva and take Ilius. But I will not stay my anger,\rnor permit any god to help the Danaans till I have accomplished the\rdesire of the son of Peleus, according to the promise I made by bowing\rmy head on the day when Thetis touched my knees and besought me to\rgive him honour." \r\rJuno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great Olympus.\rSwift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vast continents,\rand he says to himself, "Now I will be here, or there," and he would\rhave all manner of things- even so swiftly did Juno wing her way till\rshe came to high Olympus and went in among the gods who were gathered\rin the house of Jove. When they saw her they all of them came up to\rher, and held out their cups to her by way of greeting. She let the\rothers be, but took the cup offered her by lovely Themis, who was\rfirst to come running up to her. "Juno," said she, "why are you here?\rAnd you seem troubled- has your husband the son of Saturn been frightening\ryou?" \r\rAnd Juno answered, "Themis, do not ask me about it. You know what\ra proud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods to table,\rwhere you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designs which\rhe has avowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal, will be angered by\rthem, however peaceably he may be feasting now." \r\rOn this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the house\rof Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed with care,\rand she spoke up in a rage. "Fools that we are," she cried, "to be\rthus madly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to go up to him and\rstay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and cares for\rnobody, for he knows that he is much stronger than any other of the\rimmortals. Make the best, therefore, of whatever ills he may choose\rto send each one of you; Mars, I take it, has had a taste of them\ralready, for his son Ascalaphus has fallen in battle- the man whom\rof all others he loved most dearly and whose father he owns himself\rto be." \r\rWhen he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat\rof his hands, and said in anger, "Do not blame me, you gods that dwell\rin heaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death\rof my son, even though it end in my being struck by Jove\'s lightning\rand lying in blood and dust among the corpses." \r\rAs he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout, while\rhe put on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused to still\rmore fierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals, had\rnot Minerva, ararmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from her seat\rand hurried outside. She tore the helmet from his head and the shield\rfrom his shoulders, and she took the bronze spear from his strong\rhand and set it on one side; then she said to Mars, "Madman, you are\rundone; you have ears that hear not, or you have lost all judgement\rand understanding; have you not heard what Juno has said on coming\rstraight from the presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wish to go through\rall kinds of suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry\rto Olympus, after having caused infinite mischief to all us others?\rJove would instantly leave the Trojans and Achaeans to themselves;\rhe would come to Olympus to punish us, and would grip us up one after\ranother, guilty or not guilty. Therefore lay aside your anger for\rthe death of your son; better men than he have either been killed\ralready or will fall hereafter, and one cannot protect every one\'s\rwhole family." \r\rWith these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Juno called\rApollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods. "Jove," she said\rto them, "desires you to go to him at once on Mt. Ida; when you have\rseen him you are to do as he may then bid you." \r\rThereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris and\rApollo made all haste on their way. When they reached many-fountained\rIda, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove seated on topmost Gargarus\rwith a fragrant cloud encircling his head as with a diadem. They stood\rbefore his presence, and he was pleased with them for having been\rso quick in obeying the orders his wife had given them. \r\rHe spoke to Iris first. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, tell King Neptune\rwhat I now bid you- and tell him true. Bid him leave off fighting,\rand either join the company of the gods, or go down into the sea.\rIf he takes no heed and disobeys me, let him consider well whether\rhe is strong enough to hold his own against me if I attack him. I\ram older and much stronger than he is; yet he is not afraid to set\rhimself up as on a level with myself, of whom all the other gods stand\rin awe." \r\rIris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or snowflakes\rthat fly from out the clouds before the blast of Boreas, even so did\rshe wing her way till she came close up to the great shaker of the\rearth. Then she said, "I have come, O dark-haired king that holds\rthe world in his embrace, to bring you a message from Jove. He bids\ryou leave off fighting, and either join the company of the gods or\rgo down into the sea; if, however, you take no heed and disobey him,\rhe says he will come down here and fight you. He would have you keep\rout of his reach, for he is older and much stronger than you are,\rand yet you are not afraid to set yourself up as on a level with himself,\rof whom all the other gods stand in awe." \r\rNeptune was very angry and said, "Great heavens! strong as Jove may\rbe, he has said more than he can do if he has threatened violence\ragainst me, who am of like honour with himself. We were three brothers\rwhom Rhea bore to Saturn- Jove, myself, and Hades who rules the world\rbelow. Heaven and earth were divided into three parts, and each of\rus was to have an equal share. When we cast lots, it fell to me to\rhave my dwelling in the sea for evermore; Hades took the darkness\rof the realms under the earth, while air and sky and clouds were the\rportion that fell to Jove; but earth and great Olympus are the common\rproperty of all. Therefore I will not walk as Jove would have me.\rFor all his strength, let him keep to his own third share and be contented\rwithout threatening to lay hands upon me as though I were nobody.\rLet him keep his bragging talk for his own sons and daughters, who\rmust perforce obey him. \r\rIris fleet as the wind then answered, "Am I really, Neptune, to take\rthis daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you reconsider\ryour answer? Sensible people are open to argument, and you know that\rthe Erinyes always range themselves on the side of the older person."\r\rNeptune answered, "Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken in season.\rIt is well when a messenger shows so much discretion. Nevertheless\rit cuts me to the very heart that any one should rebuke so angrily\ranother who is his own peer, and of like empire with himself. Now,\rhowever, I will give way in spite of my displeasure; furthermore let\rme tell you, and I mean what I say- if contrary to the desire of myself,\rMinerva driver of the spoil, Juno, Mercury, and King Vulcan, Jove\rspares steep Ilius, and will not let the Achaeans have the great triumph\rof sacking it, let him understand that he will incur our implacable\rresentment." \r\rNeptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely did\rthe Achaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, "Go, dear Phoebus,\rto Hector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his embrace has now\rgone down under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure. Had\rhe not done so those gods who are below with Saturn would have come\rto hear of the fight between us. It is better for both of us that\rhe should have curbed his anger and kept out of my reach, for I should\rhave had much trouble with him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis,\rand shake it furiously, so as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic;\rtake, moreover, brave Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, and\rrouse him to deeds of daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying back\rto their ships and to the Hellespont. From that point I will think\rit well over, how the Achaeans may have a respite from their troubles."\r\rApollo obeyed his father\'s saying, and left the crests of Ida, flying\rlike a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. He found Hector\rno longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for he had just come\rto himself again. He knew those who were about him, and the sweat\rand hard breathing had left him from the moment when the will of aegis-bearing\rJove had revived him. Apollo stood beside him and said, "Hector, son\rof Priam, why are you so faint, and why are you here away from the\rothers? Has any mishap befallen you?" \r\rHector in a weak voice answered, "And which, kind sir, of the gods\rare you, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax struck me\ron the chest with a stone as I was killing his comrades at the ships\rof the Achaeans, and compelled me to leave off fighting? I made sure\rthat this very day I should breathe my last and go down into the house\rof Hades." \r\rThen King Apollo said to him, "Take heart; the son of Saturn has sent\ryou a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you, even\rme, Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardian hitherto\rnot only of yourself but of your city. Now, therefore, order your\rhorsemen to drive their chariots to the ships in great multitudes.\rI will go before your horses to smooth the way for them, and will\rturn the Achaeans in flight." \r\rAs he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his people.\rAnd as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallops gloriously\rover the plain to the place where he is wont to take his bath in the\rriver- he tosses his head, and his mane streams over his shoulders\ras in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed to the pastures\rwhere the mares are feeding- even so Hector, when he heard what the\rgod said, urged his horsemen on, and sped forward as fast as his limbs\rcould take him. As country peasants set their hounds on to a homed\rstag or wild goat- he has taken shelter under rock or thicket, and\rthey cannot find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom their shouts have\rroused stands in their path, and they are in no further humour for\rthe chase- even so the Achaeans were still charging on in a body,\rusing their swords and spears pointed at both ends, but when they\rsaw Hector going about among his men they were afraid, and their hearts\rfell down into their feet. \r\rThen spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a man\rwho could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight,\rwhile few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided.\rHe then with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: "What,\rin heaven\'s name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to life again?\rEvery one made sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, but\rit seems that one of the gods has again rescued him. He has killed\rmany of us Danaans already, and I take it will yet do so, for the\rhand of Jove must be with him or he would never dare show himself\rso masterful in the forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let us\rall do as I say; let us order the main body of our forces to fall\rback upon the ships, but let those of us who profess to be the flower\rof the army stand firm, and see whether we cannot hold Hector back\rat the point of our spears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive\rthat he will then think better of it before he tries to charge into\rthe press of the Danaans." \r\rThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who were\rabout Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover of Teucer, Meriones,\rand Meges peer of Mars called all their best men about them and sustained\rthe fight against Hector and the Trojans, but the main body fell back\rupon the ships of the Achaeans. \r\rThe Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding\ron at their head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in cloud\rabout his shoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with its shaggy\rfringe, which Vulcan the smith had given Jove to strike terror into\rthe hearts of men. With this in his hand he led on the Trojans.\r\rThe Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of battle\rrose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the bowstrings.\rMany a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in the bodies of\rmany a valiant warrior, while others fell to earth midway, before\rthey could taste of man\'s fair flesh and glut themselves with blood.\rSo long as Phoebus Apollo held his aegis quietly and without shaking\rit, the weapons on either side took effect and the people fell, but\rwhen he shook it straight in the face of the Danaans and raised his\rmighty battle-cry their hearts fainted within them and they forgot\rtheir former prowess. As when two wild beasts spring in the dead of\rnight on a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when the herdsman\ris not there- even so were the Danaans struck helpless, for Apollo\rfilled them with panic and gave victory to Hector and the Trojans.\r\rThe fight then became more scattered and they killed one another where\rthey best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the one, leader\rof the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade of Menestheus.\rAeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was bastard son to Oileus,\rand brother to Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his own country,\rfor he had killed a man, a kinsman of his stepmother Eriopis whom\rOileus had married. Iasus had become a leader of the Athenians, and\rwas son of Sphelus the son of Boucolos. Polydamas killed Mecisteus,\rand Polites Echius, in the front of the battle, while Agenor slew\rClonius. Paris struck Deiochus from behind in the lower part of the\rshoulder, as he was flying among the foremost, and the point of the\rspear went clean through him. \r\rWhile they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the Achaeans\rwere flying pellmell to the trench and the set stakes, and were forced\rback within their wall. Hector then cried out to the Trojans, "Forward\rto the ships, and let the spoils be. If I see any man keeping back\ron the other side the wall away from the ships I will have him killed:\rhis kinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his dues of fire, but\rdogs shall tear him in pieces in front of our city." \r\rAs he spoke he laid his whip about his horses\' shoulders and called\rto the Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted with a\rcry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck with his\rown. Phoebus Apollo went before, and kicked down the banks of the\rdeep trench into its middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as\rbroad as the throw of a spear when a man is trying his strength. The\rTrojan battalions poured over the bridge, and Apollo with his redoubtable\raegis led the way. He kicked down the wall of the Achaeans as easily\ras a child who playing on the sea-shore has built a house of sand\rand then kicks it down again and destroys it- even so did you, O Apollo,\rshed toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them with panic and\rconfusion. \r\rThus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out\rto one another and raising their hands with loud cries every man to\rheaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted\rup his hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more fervently\rthan any of them. "Father Jove," said he, "if ever any one in wheat-growing\rArgos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer and prayed that\rhe might return safely home, whereon you bowed your head to him in\rassent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojans to triumph\rthus over the Achaeans." \r\rAll counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to die prayer of the\raged son of Neleus. When the heard Jove thunder they flung themselves\ryet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breaking over the bulwarks\rof a ship when the sea runs high before a gale- for it is the force\rof the wind that makes the waves so great- even so did the Trojans\rspring over the wall with a shout, and drive their chariots onwards.\rThe two sides fought with their double-pointed spears in hand-to-hand\rencounter-the Trojans from their chariots, and the Achaeans climbing\rup into their ships and wielding the long pikes that were lying on\rthe decks ready for use in a sea-fight, jointed and shod with bronze.\r\rNow Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting about\rthe wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships, remained sitting\rin the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining him with his conversation\rand spreading herbs over his wound to ease his pain. When, however,\rhe saw the Trojans swarming through the breach in the wall, while\rthe Achaeans were clamouring and struck with panic, he cried aloud,\rand smote his two thighs with the flat of his hands. "Eurypylus,"\rsaid he in his dismay, "I know you want me badly, but I cannot stay\rwith you any longer, for there is hard fighting going on; a servant\rshall take care of you now, for I must make all speed to Achilles,\rand induce him to fight if I can; who knows but with heaven\'s help\rI may persuade him. A man does well to listen to the advice of a friend."\r\rWhen he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm and\rresisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were fewer in\rnumber, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither could\rthe Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their way in among the\rtents and ships. As a carpenter\'s line gives a true edge to a piece\rof ship\'s timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom Minerva\rhas instructed in all kinds of useful arts- even so level was the\rissue of the fight between the two sides, as they fought some round\rone and some round another. \r\rHector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about the\rsame ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the ship, nor\ryet could Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which heaven had brought\rhim. \r\rThen Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear\ras he was bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the ground\rand the torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallen\rin front of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying,\r"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a\rjot, but rescue the son of Clytius lest the Achaeans strip him of\rhis armour now that he has fallen." \r\rHe then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hit Lycophron\ra follower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was living with Ajax\rinasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans. Hector\'s spear\rstruck him on the head below the ear, and he fell headlong from the\rship\'s prow on to the ground with no life left in him. Ajax shook\rwith rage and said to his brother, "Teucer, my good fellow, our trusty\rcomrade the son of Mastor has fallen, he came to live with us from\rCythera and whom we honoured as much as our own parents. Hector has\rjust killed him; fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which\rPhoebus Apollo gave you." \r\rTeucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver\rin his hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans, and\rhit Cleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son\rof Panthous, with the reins in his hands as he was attending to his\rhorses; he was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight,\rdoing good service to Hector and the Trojans, but evil had now come\rupon him, and not one of those who were fain to do so could avert\rit, for the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. He fell from\rhis chariot and his horses shook the empty car as they swerved aside.\rKing Polydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come up\rto the horses; he gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon,\rand ordered him to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He\rthen went back and took his place in the front ranks. \r\rTeucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have been\rno more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed him then\rand there: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector, had his eyes\ron Teucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking his bowstring\rfor him just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim; on this\rthe arrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands. Teucer shook\rwith anger and said to his brother, "Alas, see how heaven thwarts\rus in all we do; it has broken my bowstring and snatched the bow from\rmy hand, though I strung it this selfsame morning that it might serve\rme for many an arrow." \r\rAjax son of Telamon answered, "My good fellow, let your bow and your\rarrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite the Danaans.\rTake your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and both fight\rthe Trojans yourself and urge others to do so. They may be successful\rfor the moment but if we fight as we ought they will find it a hard\rmatter to take the ships." \r\rTeucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shield\rfour hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he set\rhis helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly\rabove it; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and forthwith\rhe was by the side of Ajax. \r\rWhen Hector saw that Teucer\'s bow was of no more use to him, he shouted\rout to the Trojans and Lycians, "Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians\rgood in close fight, be men, my friends, and show your mettle here\rat the ships, for I see the weapon of one of their chieftains made\ruseless by the hand of Jove. It is easy to see when Jove is helping\rpeople and means to help them still further, or again when he is bringing\rthem down and will do nothing for them; he is now on our side, and\ris going against the Argives. Therefore swarm round the ships and\rfight. If any of you is struck by spear or sword and loses his life,\rlet him die; he dies with honour who dies fighting for his country;\rand he will leave his wife and children safe behind him, with his\rhouse and allotment unplundered if only the Achaeans can be driven\rback to their own land, they and their ships." \r\rWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on the\rother side exhorted his comrades saying, "Shame on you Argives, we\rare now utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving the\renemy from our ships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, that you\rwill be able to get home by land? Can you not hear him cheering on\rhis whole host to fire our fleet, and bidding them remember that they\rare not at a dance but in battle? Our only course is to fight them\rwith might and main; we had better chance it, life or death, once\rfor all, than fight long and without issue hemmed in at our ships\rby worse men than ourselves." \r\rWith these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector then killed\rSchedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and Ajax killed\rLaodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor. Polydamas killed\rOtus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief of the proud\rEpeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, but Polydamas crouched\rdown, and he missed him, for Apollo would not suffer the son of Panthous\rto fall in battle; but the spear hit Croesmus in the middle of his\rchest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and Meges stripped him\rof his armour. At that moment the valiant soldier Dolops son of Lampus\rsprang upon Lampus was son of Laomedon and for his valour, while his\rson Dolops was versed in all the ways of war. He then struck the middle\rof the son of Phyleus\' shield with his spear, setting on him at close\rquarters, but his good corslet made with plates of metal saved him;\rPhyleus had brought it from Ephyra and the river Selleis, where his\rhost, King Euphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protect\rhim. It now served to save the life of his son. Then Meges struck\rthe topmost crest of Dolops\'s bronze helmet with his spear and tore\raway its plume of horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with scarlet\ras it was it tumbled down into the dust. While he was still fighting\rand confident of victory, Menelaus came up to help Meges, and got\rby the side of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder,\rfrom behind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into\rhis chest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him\rto strip him of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers\rfor help, and he especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of Hiketaon,\rwho erewhile used to pasture his herds of cattle in Percote before\rthe war broke out; but when the ships of the Danaans came, he went\rback to Ilius, where he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near\rPriam who treated him as one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him\rand said, "Why, Melanippus, are we thus remiss? do you take no note\rof the death of your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying\rto take Dolops\'s armour? Follow me; there must be no fighting the\rArgives from a distance now, but we must do so in close combat till\reither we kill them or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her\rpeople." \r\rHe led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after. Meanwhile\rAjax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. "My friends," he\rcried, "be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves in battle so as\rto win respect from one another. Men who respect each other\'s good\ropinion are less likely to be killed than those who do not, but in\rflight there is neither gain nor glory." \r\rThus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back the\rTrojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with\ra wall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus of the\rloud battle-cry urged Antilochus on. "Antilochus," said he, "you are\ryoung and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or more\rvaliant than you are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan and\rkill him." \r\rHe hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at once darted\rout from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking carefully\rround him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the dart did not\rspeed from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippus the proud\rson of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming forward,\rand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\rAntilochus sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawn which a hunter\rhas hit as it was breaking away from its covert, and killed it. Even\rso, O Melanippus, did stalwart Antilochus spring upon you to strip\ryou of your armour; but noble Hector marked him, and came running\rup to him through the thick of the battle. Antilochus, brave soldier\rthough he was, would not stay to face him, but fled like some savage\rcreature which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has killed\ra dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can\rbe gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestor fly, and the\rTrojans and Hector with a cry that rent the air showered their weapons\rafter him; nor did he turn round and stay his flight till he had reached\rhis comrades. \r\rThe Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the ships\rin fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them on to\rnew deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the Argives\rand defeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he meant giving\rglory to Hector son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon the\rships, till he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis had\rmade him; Jove, therefore, bided his time till he should see the glare\rof a blazing ship. From that hour he was about so to order that the\rTrojans should be driven back from the ships and to vouchsafe glory\rto the Achaeans. With this purpose he inspired Hector son of Priam,\rwho was cager enough already, to assail the ships. His fury was as\rthat of Mars, or as when a fire is raging in the glades of some dense\rforest upon the mountains; he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared\runder his terrible eye-brows, and his helmet quivered on his temples\rby reason of the fury with which he fought. Jove from heaven was with\rhim, and though he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victory\rand glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and already Pallas\rMinerva was hurrying on the hour of his destruction at the hands of\rthe son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept trying to break the ranks\rof the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in the goodliest\rarmour; but do what he might he could not break through them, for\rthey stood as a tower foursquare, or as some high cliff rising from\rthe grey sea that braves the anger of the gale, and of the waves that\rthunder up against it. He fell upon them like flames of fire from\revery quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain high by wind and storm,\rbreaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam, the fierce winds roar\ragainst the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, and\rthey are saved but by a very little from destruction- even so were\rthe hearts of the Achaeans fainting within them. Or as a savage lion\rattacking a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in the\rlow-lying meadows by some wide-watered shore- the herdsman is at his\rwit\'s end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now in the\rvan and now in the rear of his cattle, while the lion springs into\rthe thick of them and fastens on a cow so that they all tremble for\rfear- even so were the Achaeans utterly panic-stricken by Hector and\rfather Jove. Nevertheless Hector only killed Periphetes of Mycenae;\rhe was son of Copreus who was wont to take the orders of King Eurystheus\rto mighty Hercules, but the son was a far better man than the father\rin every way; he was fleet of foot, a valiant warrior, and in understanding\rranked among the foremost men of Mycenae. He it was who then afforded\rHector a triumph, for as he was turning back he stumbled against the\rrim of his shield which reached his feet, and served to keep the javelins\roff him. He tripped against this and fell face upward, his helmet\rringing loudly about his head as he did so. Hector saw him fall and\rran up to him; he then thrust a spear into his chest, and killed him\rclose to his own comrades. These, for all their sorrow, could not\rhelp him for they were themselves terribly afraid of Hector.\r\rThey had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had been\rdrawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans came pouring\rafter them. The Argives were driven back from the first row of ships,\rbut they made a stand by their tents without being broken up and scattered;\rshame and fear restrained them. They kept shouting incessantly to\rone another, and Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans,\rwas loudest in imploring every man by his parents, and beseeching\rhim to stand firm. \r\r"Be men, my friends," he cried, "and respect one another\'s good opinion.\rThink, all of you, on your children, your wives, your property, and\ryour parents whether these be alive or dead. On their behalf though\rthey are not here, I implore you to stand firm, and not to turn in\rflight." \r\rWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva lifted\rthe thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell upon\rthem, alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight was\rraging. They could see Hector and all his men, both those in the rear\rwho were taking no part in the battle, and those who were fighting\rby the ships. \r\rAjax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but strode\rfrom deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelve cubits\rlong and jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats of horsemanship\rcouples four horses together and comes tearing full speed along the\rpublic way from the country into some large town- many both men and\rwomen marvel as they see him for he keeps all the time changing his\rhorse, springing from one to another without ever missing his feet\rwhile the horses are at a gallop- even so did Ajax go striding from\rone ship\'s deck to another, and his voice went up into the heavens.\rHe kept on shouting his orders to the Danaans and exhorting them to\rdefend their ships and tents; neither did Hector remain within the\rmain body of the Trojan warriors, but as a dun eagle swoops down upon\ra flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river-geese, it may be, or cranes,\ror long-necked swans- even so did Hector make straight for a dark-prowed\rship, rushing right towards it; for Jove with his mighty hand impelled\rhim forward, and roused his people to follow him. \r\rAnd now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would have\rthought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercely did\rthey fight; and this was the mind in which they were- the Achaeans\rdid not believe they should escape destruction but thought themselves\rdoomed, while there was not a Trojan but his heart beat high with\rthe hope of firing the ships and putting the Achaean heroes to the\rsword. \r\rThus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of the\rgood ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never bore him\rback to his native land. Round this ship there raged a close hand-to-hand\rfight between Danaans and Trojans. They did not fight at a distance\rwith bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked at one another in\rclose combat with their mighty swords and spears pointed at both ends;\rthey fought moreover with keen battle-axes and with hatchets. Many\ra good stout blade hilted and scabbarded with iron, fell from hand\ror shoulder as they fought, and the earth ran red with blood. Hector,\rwhen he had seized the ship, would not loose his hold but held on\rto its curved stern and shouted to the Trojans, "Bring fire, and raise\rthe battle-cry all of you with a single voice. Now has Jove vouchsafed\rus a day that will pay us for all the rest; this day we shall take\rthe ships which came hither against heaven\'s will, and which have\rcaused us such infinite suffering through the cowardice of our councillors,\rwho when I would have done battle at the ships held me back and forbade\rthe host to follow me; if Jove did then indeed warp our judgements,\rhimself now commands me and cheers me on." \r\rAs he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the Achaeans,\rand Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome by the darts\rthat were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed. Therefore\rhe left the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on to the seven-foot\rbench of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-out, and with his\rspear held back Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to the ships. All\rthe time he kept on shouting at the top of his voice and exhorting\rthe Danaans. "My friends," he cried, "Danaan heroes, servants of Mars,\rbe men my friends, and fight with might and with main. Can we hope\rto find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us more surely than\rthe one we have? There is no strong city within reach, whence we may\rdraw fresh forces to turn the scales in our favour. We are on the\rplain of the armed Trojans with the sea behind us, and far from our\rown country. Our salvation, therefore, is in the might of our hands\rand in hard fighting." \r\rAs he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and when\rany Trojan made towards the ships with fire at Hector\'s bidding, he\rwould be on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his long spear.\rTwelve men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand fight before the ships.\r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XVI\r\rThus did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclus\rdrew near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from some\rspring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice.\rWhen Achilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said,\r"Why, Patroclus, do you stand there weeping like some silly child\rthat comes running to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried-\rshe catches hold of her mother\'s dress to stay her though she is in\ra hurry, and looks tearfully up until her mother carries her- even\rsuch tears, Patroclus, are you now shedding. Have you anything to\rsay to the Myrmidons or to myself? or have you had news from Phthia\rwhich you alone know? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor is still\ralive, as also Peleus son of Aeacus, among the Myrmidons- men whose\rloss we two should bitterly deplore; or are you grieving about the\rArgives and the way in which they are being killed at the ships, throu\rtheir own high-handed doings? Do not hide anything from me but tell\rme that both of us may know about it." \r\rThen, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered, "Achilles,\rson of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do not be angry,\rbut I weep for the disaster that has now befallen the Argives. All\rthose who have been their champions so far are lying at the ships,\rwounded by sword or spear. Brave Diomed son of Tydeus has been hit\rwith a spear, while famed Ulysses and Agamemnon have received sword-wounds;\rEurypylus again has been struck with an arrow in the thigh; skilled\rapothecaries are attending to these heroes, and healing them of their\rwounds; are you still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May it never be\rmy lot to nurse such a passion as you have done, to the baning of\ryour own good name. Who in future story will speak well of you unless\ryou now save the Argives from ruin? You know no pity; knight Peleus\rwas not your father nor Thetis your mother, but the grey sea bore\ryou and the sheer cliffs begot you, so cruel and remorseless are you.\rIf however you are kept back through knowledge of some oracle, or\rif your mother Thetis has told you something from the mouth of Jove,\rat least send me and the Myrmidons with me, if I may bring deliverance\rto the Danaans. Let me moreover wear your armour; the Trojans may\rthus mistake me for you and quit the field, so that the hard-pressed\rsons of the Achaeans may have breathing time- which while they are\rfighting may hardly be. We who are fresh might soon drive tired men\rback from our ships and tents to their own city." \r\rHe knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own\rdestruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, "What, noble\rPatroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am heeding,\rnor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Jove, but I am\rcut to the very heart that one of my own rank should dare to rob me\rbecause he is more powerful than I am. This, after all that I have\rgone through, is more than I can endure. The girl whom the sons of\rthe Achaeans chose for me, whom I won as the fruit of my spear on\rhaving sacked a city- her has King Agamemnon taken from me as though\rI were some common vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: no man\rmay keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent till battle\rand the cry of war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird\rmy armour about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle,\rfor the dark cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet;\rthe Argives are driven back on to the beach, cooped within a narrow\rspace, and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out against\rthem, because they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming near them.\rHad they seen this, there would not have been a creek nor grip that\rhad not been filled with their dead as they fled back again. And so\rit would have been, if only King Agamemnon had dealt fairly by me.\rAs it is the Trojans have beset our host. Diomed son of Tydeus no\rlonger wields his spear to defend the Danaans, neither have I heard\rthe voice of the son of Atreus coming from his hated head, whereas\rthat of murderous Hector rings in my cars as he gives orders to the\rTrojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and fill the whole plain with\rtheir cry of battle. But even so, Patroclus, fall upon them and save\rthe fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and prevent us from being able\rto return. Do, however, as I now bid you, that you may win me great\rhonour from all the Danaans, and that they may restore the girl to\rme again and give me rich gifts into the bargain. When you have driven\rthe Trojans from the ships, come back again. Though Juno\'s thundering\rhusband should put triumph within your reach, do not fight the Trojans\rfurther in my absence, or you will rob me of glory that should be\rmine. And do not for lust of battle go on killing the Trojans nor\rlead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest one of the ever-living gods from\rOlympus attack you- for Phoebus Apollo loves them well: return when\ryou have freed the ships from peril, and let others wage war upon\rthe plain. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that not a\rsingle man of all the Trojans might be left alive, nor yet of the\rArgives, but that we two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle\rthat veils the brow of Troy." \r\rThus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground for\rthe shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove and the\rjavelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamed\rabout his temples rang with the continuous clatter of the missiles\rthat kept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protected\rhis face. Moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held his\rshield so long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they would, they\rcould not make him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the\rsweat rained from every pore of his body, he had not a moment\'s respite,\rand on all sides he was beset by danger upon danger. \r\rAnd now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how\rfire was thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close\rup and let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax.\rHe cut it clean in two just behind where the point was fastened on\rto the shaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a\rheadless spear, while the bronze point flew some way off and came\rringing down on to the ground. Ajax knew the hand of heaven in this,\rand was dismayed at seeing that Jove had now left him utterly defenceless\rand was willing victory for the Trojans. Therefore he drew back, and\rthe Trojans flung fire upon the ship which was at once wrapped in\rflame. \r\rThe fire was now flaring about the ship\'s stern, whereon Achilles\rsmote his two thighs and said to Patroclus, "Up, noble knight, for\rI see the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroy\rour ships, and there be no way by which we may retreat. Gird on your\rarmour at once while I call our people together." \r\rAs he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his legs\rwith greaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver;\rafter this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus, richly inlaid\rand studded. He hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his\rshoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his\rhelmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly\rabove it. He grasped two redoubtable spears that suited his hands,\rbut he did not take the spear of noble Achilles, so stout and strong,\rfor none other of the Achaeans could wield it, though Achilles could\rdo so easily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion, which Chiron\rhad cut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus, wherewith to\rdeal out death among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke his horses with\rall speed, for he was the man whom he held in honour next after Achilles,\rand on whose support in battle he could rely most firmly. Automedon\rtherefore yoked the fleet horses Xanthus and Balius, steeds that could\rfly like the wind: these were they whom the harpy Podarge bore to\rthe west wind, as she was grazing in a meadow by the waters of the\rriver Oceanus. In the side traces he set the noble horse Pedasus,\rwhom Achilles had brought away with him when he sacked the city of\rEetion, and who, mortal steed though he was, could take his place\ralong with those that were immortal. \r\rMeanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and bade\rhis Myrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening wolves\rthat are feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon the\rmountains, and their jaws are red with blood- they go in a pack to\rlap water from the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and\rthey reek of blood and slaughter; they know not what fear is, for\rit is hunger drives them- even so did the leaders and counsellors\rof the Myrmidons gather round the good squire of the fleet descendant\rof Aeacus, and among them stood Achilles himself cheering on both\rmen and horses. \r\rFifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each there\rwas a crew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom\rhe could trust, while he was himself commander over them all. Menesthius\rof the gleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius that streams\rfrom heaven, was captain of the first company. Fair Polydora daughter\rof Peleus bore him to ever-flowing Spercheius- a woman mated with\ra god- but he was called son of Borus son of Perieres, with whom his\rmother was living as his wedded wife, and who gave great wealth to\rgain her. The second company was led by noble Eudorus, son to an unwedded\rwoman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas the graceful dancer, bore him;\rthe mighty slayer of Argos was enamoured of her as he saw her among\rthe singing women at a dance held in honour of Diana the rushing huntress\rof the golden arrows; he therefore- Mercury, giver of all good- went\rwith her into an upper chamber, and lay with her in secret, whereon\rshe bore him a noble son Eudorus, singularly fleet of foot and in\rfight valiant. When Ilithuia goddess of the pains of child-birth brought\rhim to the light of day, and he saw the face of the sun, mighty Echecles\rson of Actor took the mother to wife, and gave great wealth to gain\rher, but her father Phylas brought the child up, and took care of\rhim, doting as fondly upon him as though he were his own son. The\rthird company was led by Pisander son of Maemalus, the finest spearman\ramong all the Myrmidons next to Achilles\' own comrade Patroclus. The\rold knight Phoenix was captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon,\rnoble son of Laerceus of the fifth. \r\rWhen Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with their\rcaptains, he charged them straitly saying, "Myrmidons, remember your\rthreats against the Trojans while you were at the ships in the time\rof my anger, and you were all complaining of me. \'Cruel son of Peleus,\'\ryou would say, \'your mother must have suckled you on gall, so ruthless\rare you. You keep us here at the ships against our will; if you are\rso relentless it were better we went home over the sea.\' Often have\ryou gathered and thus chided with me. The hour is now come for those\rhigh feats of arms that you have so long been pining for, therefore\rkeep high hearts each one of you to do battle with the Trojans."\r\rWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they serried\rtheir companies yet more closely when they heard the of their king.\rAs the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some high house\rwhich is to give shelter from the winds- even so closely were the\rhelmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shield pressed\ron shield, helm on helm, and man on man; so close were they that the\rhorse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of their helmets touched\reach other as they bent their heads. \r\rIn front of them all two men put on their armour- Patroclus and Automedon-\rtwo men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. Then Achilles went\rinside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chest which silver-footed\rThetis had given him to take on board ship, and which she had filled\rwith shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and good thick rugs. In\rthis chest he had a cup of rare workmanship, from which no man but\rhimself might drink, nor would he make offering from it to any other\rgod save only to father Jove. He took the cup from the chest and cleansed\rit with sulphur; this done he rinsed it clean water, and after he\rhad washed his hands he drew wine. Then he stood in the middle of\rthe court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making his drink-offering\rof wine; nor was he unseen of Jove whose joy is in thunder. "King\rJove," he cried, "lord of Dodona, god of the Pelasgi, who dwellest\rafar, you who hold wintry Dodona in your sway, where your prophets\rthe Selli dwell around you with their feet unwashed and their couches\rmade upon the ground- if you heard me when I prayed to you aforetime,\rand did me honour while you sent disaster on the Achaeans, vouchsafe\rme now the fulfilment of yet this further prayer. I shall stay here\rwhere my ships are lying, but I shall send my comrade into battle\rat the head of many Myrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Jove, that victory\rmay go with him; put your courage into his heart that Hector may learn\rwhether my squire is man enough to fight alone, or whether his might\ris only then so indomitable when I myself enter the turmoil of war.\rAfterwards when he has chased the fight and the cry of battle from\rthe ships, grant that he may return unharmed, with his armour and\rhis comrades, fighters in close combat." \r\rThus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part\rof it he did indeed vouchsafe him- but not the whole. He granted that\rPatroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships, but refused\rto let him come safely out of the fight. \r\rWhen he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilles\rwent inside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.\r\rThen he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fierce\rfight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans. \r\rMeanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on till\rthey sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out\rlike wasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children\rlove to tease, whereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung-\ror again, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident,\revery wasp will come flying out in a fury to defend his little ones-\reven with such rage and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from their\rships, and their cry of battle rose heavenwards. Patroclus called\rout to his men at the top of his voice, "Myrmidons, followers of Achilles\rson of Peleus, be men my friends, fight with might and with main,\rthat we may win glory for the son of Peleus, who is far the foremost\rman at the ships of the Argives- he, and his close fighting followers.\rThe son of Atreus King Agamemnon will thus learn his folly in showing\rno respect to the bravest of the Achaeans." \r\rWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they fell\rin a body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the cry which\rthe Achaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave son of Menoetius\rand his squire all gleaming in their armour, they were daunted and\rtheir battalions were thrown into confusion, for they thought the\rfleet son of Peleus must now have put aside his anger, and have been\rreconciled to Agamemnon; every one, therefore, looked round about\rto see whither he might fly for safety. \r\rPatroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where men\rwere packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of Protesilaus.\rHe hit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydon\rand the broad waters of the river Axius; the spear struck him on the\rright shoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; on\rthis his men were thrown into confusion, for by killing their leader,\rwho was the finest soldier among them, Patroclus struck panic into\rthem all. He thus drove them from the ship and quenched the fire that\rwas then blazing- leaving the half-burnt ship to lie where it was.\rThe Trojans were now driven back with a shout that rent the skies,\rwhile the Danaans poured after them from their ships, shouting also\rwithout ceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of the thunder-cloud, spreads\ra dense canopy on the top of some lofty mountain, and all the peaks,\rthe jutting headlands, and forest glades show out in the great light\rthat flashes from the bursting heavens, even so when the Danaans had\rnow driven back the fire from their ships, they took breath for a\rlittle while; but the fury of the fight was not yet over, for the\rTrojans were not driven back in utter rout, but still gave battle,\rand were ousted from their ground only by sheer fighting.\r\rThe fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed one\ranother when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetius first\rdrove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he was turning\rround; the point went clean through, and broke the bone so that he\rfell forward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the chest, where\rit was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. The son\rof Phyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack him, and ere he could do\rso took aim at the upper part of his thigh, where the muscles are\rthicker than in any other part; the spear tore through all the sinews\rof the leg, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Of the sons of Nestor\rone, Antilochus, speared Atymnius, driving the point of the spear\rthrough his throat, and down he fell. Maris then sprang on Antilochus\rin hand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode the body\rspear in hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him, and\rin a moment had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow;\rhis aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root\rof his arm, and tore them right down to the bone, so he fell heavily\rto the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness. Thus did these\rtwo noble comrades of Sarpedon go down to Erebus slain by the two\rsons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of Amisodorus, who had\rreared the invincible Chimaera, to the bane of many. Ajax son of Oileus\rsprang on Cleobulus and took him alive as he was entangled in the\rcrush; but he killed him then and there by a sword-blow on the neck.\rThe sword reeked with his blood, while dark death and the strong hand\rof fate gripped him and closed his eyes. \r\rPeneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed each\rother with their spears. They had both thrown without effect, so now\rthey drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed crest of Peneleos\'\rhelmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smote Lycon\ron the neck under the ear. The blade sank so deep that the head was\rheld on by nothing but the skin, and there was no more life left in\rhim. Meriones gave chase to Acamas on foot and caught him up just\ras he was about to mount his chariot; he drove a spear through his\rright shoulder so that he fell headlong from the car, and his eyes\rwere closed in darkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; the\rbronze point of the spear went clean through it beneath the brain,\rcrashing in among the white bones and smashing them up. His teeth\rwere all of them knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream\rfrom both his eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils,\rand the darkness of death enfolded him round about. \r\rThus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his man.\rAs ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them when\rthey are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flock\rthrough the carelessness of the shepherd- and when the wolves see\rthis they pounce upon them at once because they cannot defend themselves-\reven so did the Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled with ill-omened\rcries in their panic and had no more fight left in them.\r\rMeanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector,\rbut Hector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well under\rcover of his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the whizzing\rof the arrows and the heavy thud of the spears. He well knew that\rthe fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood his ground and\rtried to protect his comrades. \r\rAs when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of a\rclear sky when Jove is brewing a gale- even with such panic stricken\rrout did the Trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going.\rHector\'s fleet horses bore him and his armour out of the fight, and\rhe left the Trojan host penned in by the deep trench against their\rwill. Many a yoke of horses snapped the pole of their chariots in\rthe trench and left their master\'s car behind them. Patroclus gave\rchase, calling impetuously on the Danaans and full of fury against\rthe Trojans, who, being now no longer in a body, filled all the ways\rwith their cries of panic and rout; the air was darkened with the\rclouds of dust they raised, and the horses strained every nerve in\rtheir flight from the tents and ships towards the city. \r\rPatroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flying\rin confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were being smashed\rin all directions, and many a man came tumbling down from his own\rcar to fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroclus, whose immortal\rsteeds, given by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench at a bound\ras they sped onward. He was intent on trying to get near Hector, for\rhe had set his heart on spearing him, but Hector\'s horses were now\rhurrying him away. As the whole dark earth bows before some tempest\ron an autumn day when Jove rains his hardest to punish men for giving\rcrooked judgement in their courts, and arriving justice therefrom\rwithout heed to the decrees of heaven- all the rivers run full and\rthe torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlong from the\rmountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of men-\reven such was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in their\rflight. \r\rPatroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and\rdrove them back to the ships. They were doing their best to reach\rthe city, but he would not Yet them, and bore down on them between\rthe river and the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade did he then\ravenge. First he hit Pronous with a spear on the chest where it was\rexposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground.\rNext he sprang on Thestor son of Enops, who was sitting all huddled\rup in his chariot, for he had lost his head and the reins had been\rtorn out of his hands. Patroclus went up to him and drove a spear\rinto his right jaw; he thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear\rpulled him over the rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of\rsome jutting rock and draws a strong fish out of the sea with a hook\rand a line- even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all gaping\rfrom his chariot; he then threw him down on his face and he died while\rfalling. On this, as Erylaus was on to attack him, he struck him full\ron the head with a stone, and his brains were all battered inside\rhis helmet, whereon he fell headlong to the ground and the pangs of\rdeath took hold upon him. Then he laid low, one after the other, Erymas,\rAmphoterus, Epaltes, Tlepolemus, Echius son of Damastor, Pyris, lpheus,\rEuippus and Polymelus son of Argeas. \r\rNow when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics,\rbeing overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked the Lycians\rsaying. "Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show your mettle;\rI will myself meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is so\rmasterful; he has done us much hurt, and has stretched many a brave\rman upon the ground." \r\rHe sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he saw\rthis, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at one another\rwith loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that scream\rand tear at one another in some high mountain fastness. \r\rThe son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said\rto Juno who was his wife and sister, "Alas, that it should be the\rlot of Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand of Patroclus.\rI am in two minds whether to catch him up out of the fight and set\rhim down safe and sound in the fertile land of Lycia, or to let him\rnow fall by the hand of the son of Menoetius." \r\rAnd Juno answered, "Most dread son of Saturn, what is this that you\rare saying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has long been\rfated, out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we shall not\rall of us be of your mind. I say further, and lay my saying to your\rheart, that if you send Sarpedon safely to his own home, some other\rof the gods will be also wanting to escort his son out of battle,\rfor there are many sons of gods fighting round the city of Troy, and\ryou will make every one jealous. If, however, you are fond of him\rand pity him, let him indeed fall by the hand of Patroclus, but as\rsoon as the life is gone out of him, send Death and sweet Sleep to\rbear him off the field and take him to the broad lands of Lycia, where\rhis brothers and his kinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar,\rin due honour to the dead." \r\rThe sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood upon\rthe earth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to kill on\rthe rich plain of Troy far from his home. \r\rWhen they were now come close to one another Patroclus struck Thrasydemus,\rthe brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of the belly, and\rkilled him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroclus and missed him,\rbut he struck the horse Pedasus in the right shoulder, and it screamed\raloud as it lay, groaning in the dust until the life went out of it.\rThe other two horses began to plunge; the pole of the chariot cracked\rand they got entangled in the reins through the fall of the horse\rthat was yoked along with them; but Automedon knew what to do; without\rthe loss of a moment he drew the keen blade that hung by his sturdy\rthigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon the other two righted\rthemselves, and pulling hard at the reins again went together into\rbattle. \r\rSarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed him,\rthe point of the spear passed over his left shoulder without hitting\rhim. Patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from\rhis hand in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds\rthe ever-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or\rtall pine to which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains\rto make timber for ship-building- even so did he lie stretched at\rfull length in front of his chariot and horses, moaning and clutching\rat the blood-stained dust. As when a lion springs with a bound upon\ra herd of cattle and fastens on a great black bull which dies bellowing\rin its clutches- even so did the leader of the Lycian warriors struggle\rin death as he fell by the hand of Patroclus. He called on his trusty\rcomrade and said, "Glaucus, my brother, hero among heroes, put forth\rall your strength, fight with might and main, now if ever quit yourself\rlike a valiant soldier. First go about among the Lycian captains and\rbid them fight for Sarpedon; then yourself also do battle to save\rmy armour from being taken. My name will haunt you henceforth and\rfor ever if the Achaeans rob me of my armour now that I have fallen\rat their ships. Do your very utmost and call all my people together."\r\rDeath closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on his\rbreast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses came out\ralong with it, and he drew out both spear-point and Sarpedon\'s soul\rat the same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds,\rwho were wild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their lords.\r\rGlaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said,\rfor he could not help him. He had to support his arm with his other\rhand, being in great pain through the wound which Teucer\'s arrow had\rgiven him when Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaucus, was assailing\rit. Therefore he prayed to far-darting Apollo saying, "Hear me O king\rfrom your seat, may be in the rich land of Lycia, or may be in Troy,\rfor in all places you can hear the prayer of one who is in distress,\ras I now am. I have a grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain,\rthere is no staunching the blood, and my whole arm drags by reason\rof my hurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor go among my foes and\rfight them, thou our prince, Jove\'s son Sarpedon, is slain. Jove defended\rnot his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal me of my wound, ease\rmy pain and grant me strength both to cheer on the Lycians and to\rfight along with them round the body of him who has fallen."\r\rThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain,\rstaunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new strength.\rGlaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god had answered\rhis prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went among the Lycian captains,\rand bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. From these\rhe strode on among the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthous and Agenor;\rhe then went in search of Aeneas and Hector, and when he had found\rthem he said, "Hector, you have utterly forgotten your allies, who\rlanguish here for your sake far from friends and home while you do\rnothing to support them. Sarpedon leader of the Lycian warriors has\rfallen- he who was at once the right and might of Lycia; Mars has\rlaid him low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand by him, my friends,\rand suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of his armour, nor to treat\rhis body with contumely in revenge for all the Danaans whom we have\rspeared at the ships." \r\rAs he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable grief;\rfor Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the main stays\rof their city, both as having much people with him, and himself the\rforemost among them all. Led by Hector, who was infuriated by the\rfall of Sarpedon, they made instantly for the Danaans with all their\rmight, while the undaunted spirit of Patroclus son of Menoetius cheered\ron the Achaeans. First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, men who needed\rno bidding. "Ajaxes," said he, "may it now please you to show youselves\rthe men you have always been, or even better- Sarpedon is fallen-\rhe who was first to overleap the wall of the Achaeans; let us take\rthe body and outrage it; let us strip the armour from his shoulders,\rand kill his comrades if they try to rescue his body." \r\rHe spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides, therefore,\rthe Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and the Myrmidons and Achaeans\ron the other, strengthened their battalions, and fought desperately\rabout the body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercely the while. Mighty was\rthe din of their armour as they came together, and Jove shed a thick\rdarkness over the fight, to increase the of the battle over the body\rof his son. \r\rAt first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for one\rof the best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son of noble\rAgacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Budeum; but\rpresently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he took refuge\rwith Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius the land of noble steeds\rto fight the Trojans under Achilles. Hector now struck him on the\rhead with a stone just as he had caught hold of the body, and his\rbrains inside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fell face\rforemost upon the body of Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus was\renraged by the death of his comrade, and sped through the front ranks\ras swiftly as a hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings.\rEven so swiftly, O noble knight Patroclus, did you make straight for\rthe Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwith he struck\rSthenelaus the son of Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone, and broke\rthe tendons that join it to the head and spine. On this Hector and\rthe front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a man can throw a\rjavelin when competing for some prize, or even in battle- so far did\rthe Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans. Glaucus, captain of the\rLycians, was the first to rally them, by killing Bathycles son of\rChalcon who lived in Hellas and was the richest man among the Myrmidons.\rGlaucus turned round suddenly, just as Bathycles who was pursuing\rhim was about to lay hold of him, and drove his spear right into the\rmiddle of his chest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and the\rfall of so good a man filled the Achaeans with dismay, while the Trojans\rwere exultant, and came up in a body round the corpse. Nevertheless\rthe Achaeans, mindful of their prowess, bore straight down upon them.\r\rMeriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus son\rof Onetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was honoured by\rthe people as though he were a god. Meriones struck him under the\rjaw and ear, so that life went out of him and the darkness of death\rlaid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hoping\rto hit him under the shield as he was advancing, but Meriones saw\rit coming and stooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew\rpast him and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went\ron quivering till Mars robbed it of its force. The spear, therefore,\rsped from Aeneas\'s hand in vain and fell quivering to the ground.\rAeneas was angry and said, "Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if\rI had hit you my spear would soon have made an end of you."\r\rAnd Meriones answered, "Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will not\rbe able to make an end of every one who comes against you. You are\ronly a mortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle\rof your shield with my spear, however strong and self-confident you\rmay be, I should soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life\rto Hades of the noble steeds." \r\rOn this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, "Meriones, hero\rthough you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my good\rfriend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead body; some\rof them must go under ground first; blows for battle, and words for\rcouncil; fight, therefore, and say nothing." \r\rHe led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. As\rthe sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the mountains-\rand the thud of their axes is heard afar- even such a din now rose\rfrom earth-clash of bronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, as\rmen smote each other with their swords and spears pointed at both\rends. A man had need of good eyesight now to know Sarpedon, so covered\rwas he from head to foot with spears and blood and dust. Men swarmed\rabout the body, as flies that buzz round the full milk-pails in spring\rwhen they are brimming with milk- even so did they gather round Sarpedon;\rnor did Jove turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the fight,\rbut kept looking at it all the time, for he was settling how best\rto kill Patroclus, and considering whether Hector should be allowed\rto end him now in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, and strip\rhim of his armour, or whether he should let him give yet further trouble\rto the Trojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the brave squire\rof Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and the Trojans back\rtowards the city and take the lives of many. First, therefore, he\rmade Hector turn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot and\rfled, bidding the other Trojans fly also, for he saw that the scales\rof Jove had turned against him. Neither would the brave Lycians stand\rfirm; they were dismayed when they saw their king lying struck to\rthe heart amid a heap of corpses- for when the son of Saturn made\rthe fight wax hot many had fallen above him. The Achaeans, therefore\rstripped the gleaming armour from his shoulders and the brave son\rof Menoetius gave it to his men to take to the ships. Then Jove lord\rof the storm-cloud said to Apollo, "Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you,\rand take Sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black blood\rfrom off him, and then bear him a long way off where you may wash\rhim in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in immortal\rraiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the two fleet messengers,\rDeath, and Sleep, who will carry him straightway to the rich land\rof Lycia, where his brothers and kinsmen will inter him, and will\rraise both mound and pillar to his memory, in due honour to the dead."\r\rThus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father\'s saying, and came down from\rthe heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he took\rSarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long way\roff, where he washed him in the river, anointed him with ambrosia\rand clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him to\rthe arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who presently\rset him down in the rich land of Lycia. \r\rMeanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to Automedon,\rpursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and foolishness of his\rheart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the son of Peleus, he would\rhave, escaped death and have been scatheless; but the counsels of\rJove pass man\'s understanding; he will put even a brave man to flight\rand snatch victory from his grasp, or again he will set him on to\rfight, as he now did when he put a high spirit into the heart of Patroclus.\r\rWho then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when\rthe gods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus, Autonous,\rEcheclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor and Melanippus; after\rthese he killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes. These he slew, but the\rrest saved themselves by flight. \r\rThe sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands of\rPatroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not Phoebus Apollo\rtaken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and to aid the\rTrojans. Thrice did Patroclus charge at an angle of the high wall,\rand thrice did Apollo beat him back, striking his shield with his\rown immortal hands. When Patroclus was coming on like a god for yet\ra fourth time, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said,\r"Draw back, noble Patroclus, it is not your lot to sack the city of\rthe Trojan chieftains, nor yet will it be that of Achilles who is\ra far better man than you are." On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew\rto some distance and avoided the anger of Apollo. \r\rMeanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean gates,\rin doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or to call\rthe army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus Apollo\rdrew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior Asius,\rwho was Hector\'s uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son of Dymas\rwho lived in Phrygia by the waters of the river Sangarius; in his\rlikeness Jove\'s son Apollo now spoke to Hector saying, "Hector, why\rhave you left off fighting? It is ill done of you. If I were as much\rbetter a man than you, as I am worse, you should soon rue your slackness.\rDrive straight towards Patroclus, if so be that Apollo may grant you\ra triumph over him, and you may rull him." \r\rWith this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector bade\rCebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among them,\rand struck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector\rand the Trojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and killed no\rman, but drove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then sprang from his\rchariot to the ground, with a spear in his left hand, and in his right\ra jagged stone as large as his hand could hold. He stood still and\rthrew it, nor did it go far without hitting some one; the cast was\rnot in vain, for the stone struck Cebriones, Hector\'s charioteer,\ra bastard son of Priam, as he held the reins in his hands. The stone\rhit him on the forehead and drove his brows into his head for the\rbone was smashed, and his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He\rdropped dead from his chariot as though he were diving, and there\rwas no more life left in him. Over him did you then vaunt, O knight\rPatroclus, saying, "Bless my heart, how active he is, and how well\rhe dives. If we had been at sea this fellow would have dived from\rthe ship\'s side and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew could\rstomach, even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off his\rchariot on to the ground. It seems, then, that there are divers also\ramong the Trojans." \r\rAs he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as it were,\rof a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself struck in the\rchest, and his courage is his own bane- even so furiously, O Patroclus,\rdid you then spring upon Cebriones. Hector sprang also from his chariot\rto the ground. The pair then fought over the body of Cebriones. As\rtwo lions fight fiercely on some high mountain over the body of a\rstag that they have killed, even so did these two mighty warriors,\rPatroclus son of Menoetius and brave Hector, hack and hew at one another\rover the corpse of Cebriones. Hector would not let him go when he\rhad once got him by the head, while Patroclus kept fast hold of his\rfeet, and a fierce fight raged between the other Danaans and Trojans.\rAs the east and south wind buffet one another when they beat upon\rsome dense forest on the mountains- there is beech and ash and spreading\rcornel; the to of the trees roar as they beat on one another, and\rone can hear the boughs cracking and breaking- even so did the Trojans\rand Achaeans spring upon one another and lay about each other, and\rneither side would give way. Many a pointed spear fell to ground and\rmany a winged arrow sped from its bow-string about the body of Cebriones;\rmany a great stone, moreover, beat on many a shield as they fought\raround his body, but there he lay in the whirling clouds of dust,\rall huge and hugely, heedless of his driving now. \r\rSo long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of either\rside were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he went down\rtowards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans proved to\rbe beyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew Cebriones out of\rrange of the darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the armour\rfrom his shoulders. Then Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierce intent\rand a terrific shout upon the Trojans, and thrice did he kill nine\rmen; but as he was coming on like a god for a time, then, O Patroclus,\rwas the hour of your end approaching, for Phoebus fought you in fell\rearnest. Patroclus did not see him as he moved about in the crush,\rfor he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struck him from\rbehind on his back and his broad shoulders with the flat of his hand,\rso that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus Apollo beat the helmet from\roff his head, and it rolled rattling off under the horses\' feet, where\rits horse-hair plumes were all begrimed with dust and blood. Never\rindeed had that helmet fared so before, for it had served to protect\rthe head and comely forehead of the godlike hero Achilles. Now, however,\rZeus delivered it over to be worn by Hector. Nevertheless the end\rof Hector also was near. The bronze-shod spear, so great and so strong,\rwas broken in the hand of Patroclus, while his shield that covered\rhim from head to foot fell to the ground as did also the band that\rheld it, and Apollo undid the fastenings of his corslet.\r\rOn this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he stood\ras one dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a Dardanian, the best\rspearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest runner,\rcame behind him and struck him in the back with a spear, midway between\rthe shoulders. This man as soon as ever he had come up with his chariot\rhad dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts of\rwar- he it was, O knight Patroclus, that first drove a weapon into\ryou, but he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus then ran back into\rthe crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; he would\rnot stand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmed though he now was,\rto attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the blow the god had\rgiven him and by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of his men\rin fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him to be wounded and\rgiving ground, forced his way through the ranks, and when close up\rwith him struck him in the lower part of the belly with a spear, driving\rthe bronze point right through it, so that he fell heavily to the\rground to the great of the Achaeans. As when a lion has fought some\rfierce wild-boar and worsted him- the two fight furiously upon the\rmountains over some little fountain at which they would both drink,\rand the lion has beaten the boar till he can hardly breathe- even\rso did Hector son of Priam take the life of the brave son of Menoetius\rwho had killed so many, striking him from close at hand, and vaunting\rover him the while. "Patroclus," said he, "you deemed that you should\rsack our city, rob our Trojan women of their freedom, and carry them\roff in your ships to your own country. Fool; Hector and his fleet\rhorses were ever straining their utmost to defend them. I am foremost\rof all the Trojan warriors to stave the day of bondage from off them;\ras for you, vultures shall devour you here. Poor wretch, Achilles\rwith all his bravery availed you nothing; and yet I ween when you\rleft him he charged you straitly saying, \'Come not back to the ships,\rknight Patroclus, till you have rent the bloodstained shirt of murderous\rHector about his body. Thus I ween did he charge you, and your fool\'s\rheart answered him \'yea\' within you." \r\rThen, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight Patroclus:\r"Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturn and Apollo\rhave vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquished me so\reasily, and they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders; had\rtwenty such men as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen\rbefore my spear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered me, and\ramong mortal men Euphorbus; you are yourself third only in the killing\rof me. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, you too shall\rlive but for a little season; death and the day of your doom are close\rupon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of Achilles son of\rAeacus." \r\rWhen he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul left\rhis body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning its sad\rfate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Dead\rthough he was, Hector still spoke to him saying, "Patroclus, why should\ryou thus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son of lovely Thetis,\rmay be smitten by my spear and die before me?" \r\rAs he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his\rfoot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. He\rthen went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet descendant\rof Aeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortal steeds which\rthe gods had given as a rich gift to Peleus bore him swiftly from\rthe field. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XVII\r\rBrave Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus had\rfallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full armour\rto bestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even\rso did yellow-haired Menelaus bestride Patroclus. He held his round\rshield and his spear in front of him, resolute to kill any who should\rdare face him. But the son of Panthous had also noted the body, and\rcame up to Menelaus saying, "Menelaus, son of Atreus, draw back, leave\rthe body, and let the bloodstained spoils be. I was first of the Trojans\rand their brave allies to drive my spear into Patroclus, let me, therefore,\rhave my full glory among the Trojans, or I will take aim and kill\ryou." \r\rTo this Menelaus answered in great anger "By father Jove, boasting\ris an ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion nor savage\rwild-boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures,\rthan are the proud sons of Panthous. Yet Hyperenor did not see out\rthe days of his youth when he made light of me and withstood me, deeming\rme the meanest soldier among the Danaans. His own feet never bore\rhim back to gladden his wife and parents. Even so shall I make an\rend of you too, if you withstand me; get you back into the crowd and\rdo not face me, or it shall be worse for you. Even a fool may be wise\rafter the event." \r\rEuphorbus would not listen, and said, "Now indeed, Menelaus, shall\ryou pay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted, and whose\rwife you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought grief unspeakable\ron his parents. I shall comfort these poor people if I bring your\rhead and armour and place them in the hands of Panthous and noble\rPhrontis. The time is come when this matter shall be fought out and\rsettled, for me or against me." \r\rAs he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear did\rnot go through, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus then took\raim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was drawing back,\rand Menelaus struck him about the roots of his throat, leaning his\rwhole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. The point went\rclean through his neck, and his armour rang rattling round him as\rhe fell heavily to the ground. His hair which was like that of the\rGraces, and his locks so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold,\rwere all bedrabbled with blood. As one who has grown a fine young\rolive tree in a clear space where there is abundance of water- the\rplant is full of promise, and though the winds beat upon it from every\rquarter it puts forth its white blossoms till the blasts of some fierce\rhurricane sweep down upon it and level it with the ground- even so\rdid Menelaus strip the fair youth Euphorbus of his armour after he\rhad slain him. Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in the pride\rof his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it is feeding-\rfirst he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then gorges on\rher blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and cry against\rhim, but they stand aloof and will not come close to him, for they\rare pale with fear- even so no one had the courage to face valiant\rMenelaus. The son of Atreus would have then carried off the armour\rof the son of Panthous with ease, had not Phoebus Apollo been angry,\rand in the guise of Mentes chief of the Cicons incited Hector to attack\rhim. "Hector," said he, "you are now going after the horses of the\rnoble son of Aeacus, but you will not take them; they cannot be kept\rin hand and driven by mortal man, save only by Achilles, who is son\rto an immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaus son of Atreus has bestridden\rthe body of Patroclus and killed the noblest of the Trojans, Euphorbus\rson of Panthous, so that he can fight no more." \r\rThe god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul of\rHector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the ranks\rand saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still flowing\rfrom his wound, and Menelaus stripping him of his armour. On this\rhe made his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleaming\rarmour, and crying with a loud voice. When the son of Atreus heard\rhim, he said to himself in his dismay, "Alas! what shall I do? I may\rnot let the Trojans take the armour of Patroclus who has fallen fighting\ron my behalf, lest some Danaan who sees me should cry shame upon me.\rStill if for my honour\'s sake I fight Hector and the Trojans single-handed,\rthey will prove too many for me, for Hector is bringing them up in\rforce. Why, however, should I thus hesitate? When a man fights in\rdespite of heaven with one whom a god befriends, he will soon rue\rit. Let no Danaan think ill of me if I give place to Hector, for the\rhand of heaven is with him. Yet, if I could find Ajax, the two of\rus would fight Hector and heaven too, if we might only save the body\rof Patroclus for Achilles son of Peleus. This, of many evils would\rbe the least." \r\rWhile he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him with Hector\rat their head; he therefore drew back and left the body, turning about\rlike some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs and men from a\rstockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he is daunted and slinks\rsulkily off- even so did Menelaus son of Atreus turn and leave the\rbody of Patroclus. When among the body of his men, he looked around\rfor mighty Ajax son of Telamon, and presently saw him on the extreme\rleft of the fight, cheering on his men and exhorting them to keep\ron fighting, for Phoebus Apollo had spread a great panic among them.\rHe ran up to him and said, "Ajax, my good friend, come with me at\ronce to dead Patroclus, if so be that we may take the body to Achilles-\ras for his armour, Hector already has it." \r\rThese words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among the\rfront ranks, Menelaus going with him. Hector had stripped Patroclus\rof his armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take\rthe body to fling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax came up with his\rshield like wall before him, on which Hector withdrew under shelter\rof his men, and sprang on to his chariot, giving the armour over to\rthe Trojans to take to the city, as a great trophy for himself; Ajax,\rtherefore, covered the body of Patroclus with his broad shield and\rbestrode him; as a lion stands over his whelps if hunters have come\rupon him in a forest when he is with his little ones- in the pride\rand fierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till they\rcover his eyes- even so did Ajax bestride the body of Patroclus, and\rby his side stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow in\rhis heart. \r\rThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector and rebuked\rhim sternly. "Hector," said he, "you make a brave show, but in fight\ryou are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has no claim to so\rgreat a reputation. Think how you may now save your town and citadel\rby the hands of your own people born in Ilius; for you will get no\rLycians to fight for you, seeing what thanks they have had for their\rincessant hardships. Are you likely, sir, to do anything to help a\rman of less note, after leaving Sarpedon, who was at once your guest\rand comrade in arms, to be the spoil and prey of the Danaans? So long\ras he lived he did good service both to your city and yourself; yet\ryou had no stomach to save his body from the dogs. If the Lycians\rwill listen to me, they will go home and leave Troy to its fate. If\rthe Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which lays hold\rof men who are fighting for their country and harassing those who\rwould attack it, we should soon bear off Patroclus into Ilius. Could\rwe get this dead man away and bring him into the city of Priam, the\rArgives would readily give up the armour of Sarpedon, and we should\rget his body to boot. For he whose squire has been now killed is the\rforemost man at the ships of the Achaeans- he and his close-fighting\rfollowers. Nevertheless you dared not make a stand against Ajax, nor\rface him, eye to eye, with battle all round you, for he is a braver\rman than you are." \r\rHector scowled at him and answered, "Glaucus, you should know better.\rI have held you so far as a man of more understanding than any in\rall Lycia, but now I despise you for saying that I am afraid of Ajax.\rI fear neither battle nor the din of chariots, but Jove\'s will is\rstronger than ours; Jove at one time makes even a strong man draw\rback and snatches victory from his grasp, while at another he will\rset him on to fight. Come hither then, my friend, stand by me and\rsee indeed whether I shall play the coward the whole day through as\ryou say, or whether I shall not stay some even of the boldest Danaans\rfrom fighting round the body of Patroclus." \r\rAs he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, "Trojans, Lycians,\rand Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my friends, and\rfight might and main, while I put on the goodly armour of Achilles,\rwhich I took when I killed Patroclus." \r\rWith this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men\rwho were taking the armour of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet got\rfar. Standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changed\rhis armour. His own he sent to the strong city of Ilius and to the\rTrojans, while he put on the immortal armour of the son of Peleus,\rwhich the gods had given to Peleus, who in his age gave it to his\rson; but the son did not grow old in his father\'s armour.\r\rWhen Jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hector standing aloof and\rarming himself in the armour of the son of Peleus, he wagged his head\rand muttered to himself saying, "A! poor wretch, you arm in the armour\rof a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you reck nothing\rof the doom that is already close upon you. You have killed his comrade\rso brave and strong, but it was not well that you should strip the\rarmour from his head and shoulders. I do indeed endow you with great\rmight now, but as against this you shall not return from battle to\rlay the armour of the son of Peleus before Andromache." \r\rThe son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fitted the\rarmour to his body, while terrible Mars entered into him, and filled\rhis whole body with might and valour. With a shout he strode in among\rthe allies, and his armour flashed about him so that he seemed to\rall of them like the great son of Peleus himself. He went about among\rthem and cheered them on- Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, Thersilochus,\rAsteropaeus, Deisenor and Hippothous, Phorcys, Chromius and Ennomus\rthe augur. All these did he exhort saying, "Hear me, allies from other\rcities who are here in your thousands, it was not in order to have\ra crowd about me that I called you hither each from his several city,\rbut that with heart and soul you might defend the wives and little\rones of the Trojans from the fierce Achaeans. For this do I oppress\rmy people with your food and the presents that make you rich. Therefore\rturn, and charge at the foe, to stand or fall as is the game of war;\rwhoever shall bring Patroclus, dead though he be, into the hands of\rthe Trojans, and shall make Ajax give way before him, I will give\rhim one half of the spoils while I keep the other. He will thus share\rlike honour with myself." \r\rWhen he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaans\rwith their spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran\rhigh that he should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the body-\rfools that they were, for he was about to take the lives of many.\rThen Ajax said to Menelaus, "My good friend Menelaus, you and I shall\rhardly come out of this fight alive. I am less concerned for the body\rof Patroclus, who will shortly become meat for the dogs and vultures\rof Troy, than for the safety of my own head and yours. Hector has\rwrapped us round in a storm of battle from every quarter, and our\rdestruction seems now certain. Call then upon the princes of the Danaans\rif there is any who can hear us." \r\rMenelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help at the\rtop of his voice. "My friends," he cried, "princes and counsellors\rof the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaus drink at the\rpublic cost, and give orders each to his own people as Jove vouchsafes\rhim power and glory, the fight is so thick about me that I cannot\rdistinguish you severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden,\rand think it shame that Patroclus should become meat and morsel for\rTrojan hounds." \r\rFleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his way\rthrough the fight and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus and Meriones\rhis esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others that came into\rthe fight after these, who of his own self could name them?\r\rThe Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As a great\rwave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some heaven-born river,\rand the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of the breakers\rthat beat and buffet them- even with such a roar did the Trojans come\ron; but the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firm about the son\rof Menoetius, and fenced him with their bronze shields. Jove, moreover,\rhid the brightness of their helmets in a thick cloud, for he had borne\rno grudge against the son of Menoetius while he was still alive and\rsquire to the descendant of Aeacus; therefore he was loth to let him\rfall a prey to the dogs of his foes the Trojans, and urged his comrades\ron to defend him. \r\rAt first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew from\rthe dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing any one,\rnevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did not lose\rit long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus\ralike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied them and made towards\rthe front like a wild boar upon the mountains when he stands at bay\rin the forest glades and routs the hounds and lusty youths that have\rattacked him- even so did Ajax son of Telamon passing easily in among\rthe phalanxes of the Trojans, disperse those who had bestridden Patroclus\rand were most bent on winning glory by dragging him off to their city.\rAt this moment Hippothous brave son of the Pelasgian Lethus, in his\rzeal for Hector and the Trojans, was dragging the body off by the\rfoot through the press of the fight, having bound a strap round the\rsinews near the ancle; but a mischief soon befell him from which none\rof those could save him who would have gladly done so, for the son\rof Telamon sprang forward and smote him on his bronze-cheeked helmet.\rThe plumed headpiece broke about the point of the weapon, struck at\ronce by the spear and by the strong hand of Ajax, so that the bloody\rbrain came oozing out through the crest-socket. His strength then\rfailed him and he let Patroclus\' foot drop from his hand, as he fell\rfull length dead upon the body; thus he died far from the fertile\rland of Larissa, and never repaid his parents the cost of bringing\rhim up, for his life was cut short early by the spear of mighty Ajax.\rHector then took aim at Ajax with a spear, but he saw it coming and\rjust managed to avoid it; the spear passed on and struck Schedius\rson of noble Iphitus, captain of the Phoceans, who dwelt in famed\rPanopeus and reigned over much people; it struck him under the middle\rof the collar-bone the bronze point went right through him, coming\rout at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, and his armour rang rattling\rround him as he fell heavily to the ground. Ajax in his turn struck\rnoble Phorcys son of Phaenops in the middle of the belly as he was\rbestriding Hippothous, and broke the plate of his cuirass; whereon\rthe spear tore out his entrails and he clutched the ground in his\rpalm as he fell to earth. Hector and those who were in the front rank\rthen gave ground, while the Argives raised a loud cry of triumph,\rand drew off the bodies of Phorcys and Hippothous which they stripped\rpresently of their armour. \r\rThe Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans and\rdriven back to Ilius through their own cowardice, while the Argives,\rso great was their courage and endurance, would have achieved a triumph\reven against the will of Jove, if Apollo had not roused Aeneas, in\rthe likeness of Periphas son of Epytus, an attendant who had grown\rold in the service of Aeneas\' aged father, and was at all times devoted\rto him. In his likeness, then, Apollo said, "Aeneas, can you not manage,\reven though heaven be against us, to save high Ilius? I have known\rmen, whose numbers, courage, and self-reliance have saved their people\rin spite of Jove, whereas in this case he would much rather give victory\rto us than to the Danaans, if you would only fight instead of being\rso terribly afraid." \r\rAeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted to\rHector saying, "Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame on\rus if we are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius through\rour own cowardice. A god has just come up to me and told me that Jove\rthe supreme disposer will be with us. Therefore let us make for the\rDanaans, that it may go hard with them ere they bear away dead Patroclus\rto the ships." \r\rAs he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then rallied\rand again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiocritus son of Arisbas,\ra valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes was moved with pity\ras he saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and speared Apisaon\rson of Hippasus shepherd of his people in the liver under the midriff,\rso that he died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and was the best\rman of them all after Asteropaeus. Asteropaeus flew forward to avenge\rhim and attack the Danaans, but this might no longer be, inasmuch\ras those about Patroclus were well covered by their shields, and held\rtheir spears in front of them, for Ajax had given them strict orders\rthat no man was either to give ground, or to stand out before the\rothers, but all were to hold well together about the body and fight\rhand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them, and the earth ran red with\rblood as the corpses fell thick on one another alike on the side of\rthe Trojans and allies, and on that of the Danaans; for these last,\rtoo, fought no bloodless fight though many fewer of them perished,\rthrough the care they took to defend and stand by one another.\r\rThus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as though\rit had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were hidden\rover all that part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the\rdead son of Menoetius, whereas the other Danaans and Achaeans fought\rat their ease in full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them,\rand there was not a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain.\rThese last moreover would rest for a while and leave off fighting,\rfor they were some distance apart and beyond the range of one another\'s\rweapons, whereas those who were in the thick of the fray suffered\rboth from battle and darkness. All the best of them were being worn\rout by the great weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes,\rThrasymedes and Antilochus, had not yet heard of the death of Patroclus,\rand believed him to be still alive and leading the van against the\rTrojans; they were keeping themselves in reserve against the death\ror rout of their own comrades, for so Nestor had ordered when he sent\rthem from the ships into battle. \r\rThus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the sweat\rof their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on their hands\rand eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet son of Peleus.\rIt was as when a man gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fat to\rhis men, and bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in\ra ring and tug till the moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for\rthe many that pull at it, and it is well stretched- even so did the\rtwo sides tug the dead body hither and thither within the compass\rof but a little space- the Trojans steadfastly set on drag ing it\rinto Ilius, while the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their\rships; and fierce was the fight between them. Not Mars himself the\rlord of hosts, nor yet Minerva, even in their fullest fury could make\rlight of such a battle. \r\rSuch fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day ordain\rround the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile Achilles did not know that\rhe had fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy a long way\roff the ships. He had no idea, therefore, that Patroclus was dead,\rand deemed that he would return alive as soon as he had gone close\rup to the gates. He knew that he was not to sack the city neither\rwith nor without himself, for his mother had often told him this when\rhe had sat alone with her, and she had informed him of the counsels\rof great Jove. Now, however, she had not told him how great a disaster\rhad befallen him in the death of the one who was far dearest to him\rof all his comrades. \r\rThe others still kept on charging one another round the body with\rtheir pointed spears and killing each other. Then would one say, "My\rfriends, we can never again show our faces at the ships- better, and\rgreatly better, that earth should open and swallow us here in this\rplace, than that we should let the Trojans have the triumph of bearing\roff Patroclus to their city." \r\rThe Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying, "Friends,\rthough we fall to a man beside this body, let none shrink from fighting."\rWith such words did they exhort each other. They fought and fought,\rand an iron clank rose through the void air to the brazen vault of\rheaven. The horses of the descendant of Aeacus stood out of the fight\rand wept when they heard that their driver had been laid low by the\rhand of murderous Hector. Automedon, valiant son of Diores, lashed\rthem again and again; many a time did he speak kindly to them, and\rmany a time did he upbraid them, but they would neither go back to\rthe ships by the waters of the broad Hellespont, nor yet into battle\ramong the Achaeans; they stood with their chariot stock still, as\ra pillar set over the tomb of some dead man or woman, and bowed their\rheads to the ground. Hot tears fell from their eyes as they mourned\rthe loss of their charioteer, and their noble manes drooped all wet\rfrom under the yokestraps on either side the yoke. \r\rThe son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. He wagged\rhis head, and muttered to himself, saying, "Poor things, why did we\rgive you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you are yourselves\rageless and immortal? Was it that you might share the sorrows that\rbefall mankind? for of all creatures that live and move upon the earth\rthere is none so pitiable as he is- still, Hector son of Priam shall\rdrive neither you nor your chariot. I will not have it. It is enough\rthat he should have the armour over which he vaunts so vainly. Furthermore\rI will give you strength of heart and limb to bear Automedon safely\rto the ships from battle, for I shall let the Trojans triumph still\rfurther, and go on killing till they reach the ships; whereon night\rshall fall and darkness overshadow the land." \r\rAs he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so that\rthey shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their chariot\rswiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans and Achaeans. Behind\rthem fought Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vulture\ramid a flock of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed\rhe dashed amid the throng of the Trojans, but for all the fury of\rhis pursuit he killed no man, for he could not wield his spear and\rkeep his horses in hand when alone in the chariot; at last, however,\ra comrade, Alcimedon, son of Laerces son of Haemon caught sight of\rhim and came up behind his chariot. "Automedon," said he, "what god\rhas put this folly into your heart and robbed you of your right mind,\rthat you fight the Trojans in the front rank single-handed? He who\rwas your comrade is slain, and Hector plumes himself on being armed\rin the armour of the descendant of Aeacus." \r\rAutomedon son of Diores answered, "Alcimedon, there is no one else\rwho can control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you can,\rsave only Patroclus- while he was alive- peer of gods in counsel.\rTake then the whip and reins, while I go down from the car and fight.\r\rAlcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and reins,\rwhile Automedon leaped from off the car. When Hector saw him he said\rto Aeneas who was near him, "Aeneas, counsellor of the mail-clad Trojans,\rI see the steeds of the fleet son of Aeacus come into battle with\rweak hands to drive them. I am sure, if you think well, that we might\rtake them; they will not dare face us if we both attack them."\r\rThe valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pair went\rright on, with their shoulders covered under shields of tough dry\rox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus went also\rwith them, and their hearts beat high with hope that they might kill\rthe men and capture the horses- fools that they were, for they were\rnot to return scatheless from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed\rto father Jove and was forthwith filled with courage and strength\rabounding. He turned to his trusty comrade Alcimedon and said, "Alcimedon,\rkeep your horses so close up that I may feel their breath upon my\rback; I doubt that we shall not stay Hector son of Priam till he has\rkilled us and mounted behind the horses; he will then either spread\rpanic among the ranks of the Achaeans, or himself be killed among\rthe foremost." \r\rOn this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, "Ajaxes captains\rof the Argives, and Menelaus, give the dead body over to them that\rare best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of us living; for\rHector and Aeneas who are the two best men among the Trojans, are\rpressing us hard in the full tide of war. Nevertheless the issue lies\ron the lap of heaven, I will therefore hurl my spear and leave the\rrest to Jove." \r\rHe poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the round\rshield of Aretus, and went right through it for the shield stayed\rit not, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower part\rof his belly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow\rbehind the horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its\rneck so that it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretus\rgive one bound and then fall on his back the spear quivering in his\rbody till it made an end of him. Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon\rbut he saw it coming and stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew\rpast him and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went\ron quivering till Mars robbed it of its force. They would then have\rfought hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes forced their\rway through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, and parted\rthem for all their fury- for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromius were afraid\rand drew back, leaving Aretus to lie there struck to the heart. Automedon,\rpeer of fleet Mars, then stripped him of his armour and vaunted over\rhim saying, "I have done little to assuage my sorrow for the son of\rMenoetius, for the man I have killed is not so good as he was."\r\rAs he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon his\rchariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet all steeped\rin gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull. \r\rAnd now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus, for\rMinerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the command of\rfar-seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her to encourage\rthe Danaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in heaven in token\rto mankind either of war or of the chill storms that stay men from\rtheir labour and plague the flocks- even so, wrapped in such radiant\rraiment, did Minerva go in among the host and speak man by man to\reach. First she took the form and voice of Phoenix and spoke to Menelaus\rson of Atreus, who was standing near her. "Menelaus," said she, "it\rwill be shame and dishonour to you, if dogs tear the noble comrade\rof Achilles under the walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, and urge\ryour men to be so also." \r\rMenelaus answered, "Phoenix, my good old friend, may Minerva vouchsafe\rme strength and keep the darts from off me, for so shall I stand by\rPatroclus and defend him; his death has gone to my heart, but Hector\ris as a raging fire and deals his blows without ceasing, for Jove\ris now granting him a time of triumph." \r\rMinerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the\rother gods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and shoulders,\rand made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yet come\ragain and bite if it can, so dearly does it love man\'s blood- even\rso bold as this did she make him as he stood over Patroclus and threw\rhis spear. Now there was among the Trojans a man named Podes, son\rof Eetion, who was both rich and valiant. Hector held him in the highest\rhonour for he was his comrade and boon companion; the spear of Menelaus\rstruck this man in the girdle just as he had turned in flight, and\rwent right through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward, and Menelaus\rson of Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into the ranks of\rhis own people. \r\rApollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in the\rlikeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived in Abydos and was the\rmost favoured of all Hector\'s guests. In his likeness Apollo said,\r"Hector, who of the Achaeans will fear you henceforward now that you\rhave quailed before Menelaus who has ever been rated poorly as a soldier?\rYet he has now got a corpse away from the Trojans single-handed, and\rhas slain your own true comrade, a man brave among the foremost, Podes\rson of Eetion. \r\rA dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he made his\rway to the front clad in full armour. Thereon the son of Saturn seized\rhis bright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: he sent forth\rhis lightnings and his thunders, and as he shook his aegis he gave\rvictory to the Trojans and routed the Achaeans. \r\rThe panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keeping his\rface turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear on the\rupper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas had grazed\rthe top of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him and struck him\rfrom close at hand. Then Hector in close combat struck Leitus son\rof noble Alectryon in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him from\rfighting further. He looked about him in dismay, knowing that never\ragain should he wield spear in battle with the Trojans. While Hector\rwas in pursuit of Leitus, Idomeneus struck him on the breastplate\rover his chest near the nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft,\rand the Trojans cheered aloud. Hector then aimed at Idomeneus son\rof Deucalion as he was standing on his chariot, and very narrowly\rmissed him, but the spear hit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer\rof Meriones who had come with him from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left\rthe ships on foot and would have afforded a great triumph to the Trojans\rif Coiranus had not driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought\rlife and rescue to Idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of murderous\rHector. For Hector hit him on the jaw under the ear; the end of the\rspear drove out his teeth and cut his tongue in two pieces, so that\rhe fell from his chariot and let the reins fall to the ground. Meriones\rgathered them up from the ground and took them into his own hands,\rthen he said to Idomeneus, "Lay on, till you get back to the ships,\rfor you must see that the day is no longer ours." \r\rOn this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had taken\rhold upon him. \r\rAjax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour of\rthe Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. "Alas," said he, "even a\rfool may see that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All their weapons\rstrike home; no matter whether it be a brave man or a coward that\rhurls them, Jove speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each one of them\rwithout effect. What, then, will be best both as regards rescuing\rthe body, and our return to the joy of our friends who will be grieving\ras they look hitherwards; for they will make sure that nothing can\rnow check the terrible hands of Hector, and that he will fling himself\rupon our ships. I wish that some one would go and tell the son of\rPeleus at once, for I do not think he can have yet heard the sad news\rthat the dearest of his friends has fallen. But I can see not a man\ramong the Achaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike\rhidden in darkness. O father Jove, lift this cloud from over the sons\rof the Achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you will that\rwe perish, let us fall at any rate by daylight." \r\rFather Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears. Forthwith\rhe chased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun shone out and\rall the fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to Menelaus, "Look,\rMenelaus, and if Antilochus son of Nestor be still living, send him\rat once to tell Achilles that by far the dearest to him of all his\rcomrades has fallen." \r\rMenelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a stockyard-\rthe lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who keep watch\rthe whole night through and will not let him feast on the fat of their\rherd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at them but in vain, for\rdarts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which daunt\rhim for all his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away-\reven so did Menelaus sorely against his will leave Patroclus, in great\rfear lest the Achaeans should be driven back in rout and let him fall\rinto the hands of the foe. He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxes\rstraitly saying, "Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of the Argives, now\rindeed remember how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous while\ralive, bear it in mind now that he is dead." \r\rWith this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an eagle,\rwhose sight they say is keener than that of any other bird- however\rhigh he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escape him\rby crouching under bush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon it\rand make an end of it- even so, O Menelaus, did your keen eyes range\rround the mighty host of your followers to see if you could find the\rson of Nestor still alive. Presently Menelaus saw him on the extreme\rleft of the battle cheering on his men and exhorting them to fight\rboldly. Menelaus went up to him and said, "Antilochus, come here and\rlisten to sad news, which I would indeed were untrue. You must see\rwith your own eyes that heaven is heaping calamity upon the Danaans,\rand giving victory to the Trojans. Patroclus has fallen, who was the\rbravest of the Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. Run\rinstantly to the ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to rescue\rthe body and bear it to the ships. As for the armour, Hector already\rhas it." \r\rAntilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he was speechless;\rhis eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance, but he\rdid as Menelaus had said, and set off running as soon as he had given\rhis armour to a comrade, Laodocus, who was wheeling his horses round,\rclose beside him. \r\rThus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad news\rto Achilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O Menelaus, minded to succour\rhis harassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the Pylians- and greatly\rdid they miss him- but he sent them noble Thrasymedes, and himself\rwent back to Patroclus. He came running up to the two Ajaxes and said,\r"I have sent Antilochus to the ships to tell Achilles, but rage against\rHector as he may, he cannot come, for he cannot fight without armour.\rWhat then will be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead,\rand our own escape from death amid the battle-cries of the Trojans?"\r\rAjax answered, "Menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, and Meriones\rstoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray, while we\rtwo behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one in heart as in\rname, and long used to fighting side by side with one another."\r\rOn this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms and\rlifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host raised\ra hue and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the body\raway, and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded boar at\rthe loo of a band of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly at\rhim as though they would tear him in pieces, but now and again he\rturns on them in a fury, scaring and scattering them in all directions-\reven so did the Trojans for a while charge in a body, striking with\rsword and with spears pointed ai both the ends, but when the two Ajaxes\rfaced them and stood at bay, they would turn pale and no man dared\rpress on to fight further about the dead. \r\rIn this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the body\rto the ships out of the fight. The battle raged round them like fierce\rflames that when once kindled spread like wildfire over a city, and\rthe houses fall in the glare of its burning- even such was the roar\rand tramp of men and horses that pursued them as they bore Patroclus\rfrom the field. Or as mules that put forth all their strength to draw\rsome beam or great piece of ship\'s timber down a rough mountain-track,\rand they pant and sweat as they, go even so did Menelaus and pant\rand sweat as they bore the body of Patroclus. Behind them the two\rAjaxes held stoutly out. As some wooded mountain-spur that stretches\racross a plain will turn water and check the flow even of a great\rriver, nor is there any stream strong enough to break through it-\reven so did the two Ajaxes face the Trojans and stern the tide of\rtheir fighting though they kept pouring on towards them and foremost\ramong them all was Aeneas son of Anchises with valiant Hector. As\ra flock of daws or starlings fall to screaming and chattering when\rthey see a falcon, foe to i\'ll small birds, come soaring near them,\reven so did the Achaean youth raise a babel of cries as they fled\rbefore Aeneas and Hector, unmindful of their former prowess. In the\rrout of the Danaans much goodly armour fell round about the trench,\rand of fighting there was no end. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XVIII\r\rThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the\rfleet runner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached Achilles,\rand found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that which was\rindeed too surely true. "Alas," said he to himself in the heaviness\rof his heart, "why are the Achaeans again scouring the plain and flocking\rtowards the ships? Heaven grant the gods be not now bringing that\rsorrow upon me of which my mother Thetis spoke, saying that while\rI was yet alive the bravest of the Myrmidons should fall before the\rTrojans, and see the light of the sun no longer. I fear the brave\rson of Menoetius has fallen through his own daring and yet I bade\rhim return to the ships as soon as he had driven back those that were\rbringing fire against them, and not join battle with Hector."\r\rAs he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him and told\rhis sad tale, weeping bitterly the while. "Alas," he cried, "son of\rnoble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that they were\runtrue. Patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging about his naked\rbody- for Hector holds his armour." \r\rA dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He filled\rboth hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his head,\rdisfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over his\rshirt so fair and new. He flung himself down all huge and hugely at\rfull length, and tore his hair with his hands. The bondswomen whom\rAchilles and Patroclus had taken captive screamed aloud for grief,\rbeating their breasts, and with their limbs failing them for sorrow.\rAntilochus bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his hands\ras he lay groaning for he feared that he might plunge a knife into\rhis own throat. Then Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard\rhim as she was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her\rfather, whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus\rthat dwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There\rwere Glauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, thoe and dark-eyed\rHalie, Cymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera, Amphithoe and\rAgave, Doto and Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome and\rCallianeira, Doris, Panope, and the famous sea-nymph Galatea, Nemertes,\rApseudes and Callianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianeira and Ianassa,\rMaera, Oreithuia and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with other Nereids\rwho dwell in the depths of the sea. The crystal cave was filled with\rtheir multitude and they all beat their breasts while Thetis led them\rin their lament. \r\r"Listen," she cried, "sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may hear\rthe burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I have borne\rthe most glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and strong, hero among\rheroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended him as a plant in a\rgoodly garden, and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight the Trojans,\rbut never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long\ras he lives to look upon the light of the sun he is in heaviness,\rand though I go to him I cannot help him. Nevertheless I will go,\rthat I may see my dear son and learn what sorrow has befallen him\rthough he is still holding aloof from battle." \r\rShe left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping\rafter, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reached\rthe rich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long line\ron to the sands, at the place where the ships of the Myrmidons were\rdrawn up in close order round the tents of Achilles. His mother went\rup to him as he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head and\rspoke piteously, saying, "My son, why are you thus weeping? What sorrow\rhas now befallen you? Tell me; hide it not from me. Surely Jove has\rgranted you the prayer you made him, when you lifted up your hands\rand besought him that the Achaeans might all of them be pent up at\rtheir ships, and rue it bitterly in that you were no longer with them."\r\rAchilles groaned and answered, "Mother, Olympian Jove has indeed vouchsafed\rme the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to me, seeing that\rmy dear comrade Patroclus has fallen- he whom I valued more than all\rothers, and loved as dearly as my own life? I have lost him; aye,\rand Hector when he had killed him stripped the wondrous armour, so\rglorious to behold, which the gods gave to Peleus when they laid you\rin the couch of a mortal man. Would that you were still dwelling among\rthe immortal sea-nymphs, and that Peleus had taken to himself some\rmortal bride. For now you shall have grief infinite by reason of the\rdeath of that son whom you can never welcome home- nay, I will not\rlive nor go about among mankind unless Hector fall by my spear, and\rthus pay me for having slain Patroclus son of Menoetius."\r\rThetis wept and answered, "Then, my son, is your end near at hand-\rfor your own death awaits you full soon after that of Hector."\r\rThen said Achilles in his great grief, "I would die here and now,\rin that I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home,\rand in his hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What is\rthere for me? Return to my own land I shall not, and I have brought\rno saving neither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so\rmany have been slain by mighty Hector; I stay here by my ships a bootless\rburden upon the earth, I, who in fight have no peer among the Achaeans,\rthough in council there are better than I. Therefore, perish strife\rboth from among gods and men, and anger, wherein even a righteous\rman will harden his heart- which rises up in the soul of a man like\rsmoke, and the taste thereof is sweeter than drops of honey. Even\rso has Agamemnon angered me. And yet- so be it, for it is over; I\rwill force my soul into subjection as I needs must; I will go; I will\rpursue Hector who has slain him whom I loved so dearly, and will then\rabide my doom when it may please Jove and the other gods to send it.\rEven Hercules, the best beloved of Jove- even he could not escape\rthe hand of death, but fate and Juno\'s fierce anger laid him low,\ras I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doom awaits me. Till then\rI will win fame, and will bid Trojan and Dardanian women wring tears\rfrom their tender cheeks with both their hands in the grievousness\rof their great sorrow; thus shall they know that he who has held aloof\rso long will hold aloof no longer. Hold me not back, therefore, in\rthe love you bear me, for you shall not move me." \r\rThen silver-footed Thetis answered, "My son, what you have said is\rtrue. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but your\rarmour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph\rupon his own shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt shall not\rbe lasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the\rpress of battle till you see me return hither; to-morrow at break\rof day I shall be here, and will bring you goodly armour from King\rVulcan." \r\rOn this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said to\rthe sea-nymphs her sisters, "Dive into the bosom of the sea and go\rto the house of the old sea-god my father. Tell him everything; as\rfor me, I will go to the cunning workman Vulcan on high Olympus, and\rask him to provide my son with a suit of splendid armour."\r\rWhen she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves, while\rsilver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring the armour\rfor her son. \r\rThus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and meanwhile\rthe Achaeans were flying with loud cries before murderous Hector till\rthey reached the ships and the Hellespont, and they could not draw\rthe body of Mars\'s servant Patroclus out of reach of the weapons that\rwere showered upon him, for Hector son of Priam with his host and\rhorsemen had again caught up to him like the flame of a fiery furnace;\rthrice did brave Hector seize him by the feet, striving with might\rand main to draw him away and calling loudly on the Trojans, and thrice\rdid the two Ajaxes, clothed in valour as with a garment, beat him\rfrom off the body; but all undaunted he would now charge into the\rthick of the fight, and now again he would stand still and cry aloud,\rbut he would give no ground. As upland shepherds that cannot chase\rsome famished lion from a carcase, even so could not the two Ajaxes\rscare Hector son of Priam from the body of Patroclus. \r\rAnd now he would even have dragged it off and have won imperishable\rglory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her way as messenger\rfrom Olympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him arm. She came secretly\rwithout the knowledge of Jove and of the other gods, for Juno sent\rher, and when she had got close to him she said, "Up, son of Peleus,\rmightiest of all mankind; rescue Patroclus about whom this fearful\rfight is now raging by the ships. Men are killing one another, the\rDanaans in defence of the dead body, while the Trojans are trying\rto hale it away, and take it to wind Ilius: Hector is the most furious\rof them all; he is for cutting the head from the body and fixing it\ron the stakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide here no longer; shrink\rfrom the thought that Patroclus may become meat for the dogs of Troy.\rShame on you, should his body suffer any kind of outrage."\r\rAnd Achilles said, "Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you to\rme?" \r\rIris answered, "It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son\rof Saturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of the\rimmortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus." \r\rThen fleet Achilles answered her saying, "How can I go up into the\rbattle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till I should\rsee her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour from Vulcan;\rI know no man whose arms I can put on, save only the shield of Ajax\rson of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the front rank and\rwielding his spear about the body of dead Patroclus." \r\rIris said, \'We know that your armour has been taken, but go as you\rare; go to the deep trench and show yourelf before the Trojans, that\rthey may fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons\rof the Achaeans gain some brief breathing-time, which in battle may\rhardly be." \r\rIris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jove arose,\rand Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong shoulders;\rshe crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from which she kindled\ra glow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up into heaven from\rsome city that is being beleaguered on an island far out at sea- all\rday long do men sally from the city and fight their hardest, and at\rthe going down of the sun the line of beacon-fires blazes forth, flaring\rhigh for those that dwell near them to behold, if so be that they\rmay come with their ships and succour them- even so did the light\rflare from the head of Achilles, as he stood by the trench, going\rbeyond the wall- but he aid not join the Achaeans for he heeded the\rcharge which his mother laid upon him. \r\rThere did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voice\rfrom afar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans. Ringing\ras the note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the\rgates of a city, even so brazen was the voice of the son of Aeacus,\rand when the Trojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the\rhorses turned back with their chariots for they boded mischief, and\rtheir drivers were awe-struck by the steady flame which the grey-eyed\rgoddess had kindled above the head of the great son of Peleus.\r\rThrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench,\rand thrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown into confusion;\rwhereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath the wheels\rof their chariots and perished by their own spears. The Achaeans to\rtheir great joy then drew Patroclus out of reach of the weapons, and\rlaid him on a litter: his comrades stood mourning round him, and among\rthem fleet Achilles who wept bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying\rdead upon his bier. He had sent him out with horses and chariots into\rbattle, but his return he was not to welcome. \r\rThen Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters of\rOceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug and turmoil\rof war. \r\rNow the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked their\rhorses and gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. They\rkept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallen\rupon them all because Achilles had shown himself after having held\raloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of Panthous was first to\rspeak, a man of judgement, who alone among them could look both before\rand after. He was comrade to Hector, and they had been born upon the\rsame night; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed\rthem thus:- \r\r"Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now to your\rcity and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are far from\rour walls. So long as this man was at enmity with Agamemnon the Achaeans\rwere easier to deal with, and I would have gladly camped by the ships\rin the hope of taking them; but now I go in great fear of the fleet\rson of Peleus; he is so daring that he will never bide here on the\rplain whereon the Trojans and Achaeans fight with equal valour, but\rhe will try to storm our city and carry off our women. Do then as\rI say, and let us retreat. For this is what will happen. The darkness\rof night will for a time stay the son of Peleus, but if he find us\rhere in the morning when he sallies forth in full armour, we shall\rhave knowledge of him in good earnest. Glad indeed will he be who\rcan escape and get back to Ilius, and many a Trojan will become meat\rfor dogs and vultures may I never live to hear it. If we do as I say,\rlittle though we may like it, we shall have strength in counsel during\rthe night, and the great gates with the doors that close them will\rprotect the city. At dawn we can arm and take our stand on the walls;\rhe will then rue it if he sallies from the ships to fight us. He will\rgo back when he has given his horses their fill of being driven all\rwhithers under our walls, and will be in no mind to try and force\rhis way into the city. Neither will he ever sack it, dogs shall devour\rhim ere he do so." \r\rHector looked fiercely at him and answered, "Polydamas, your words\rare not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within\rthe city. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls?\rIn the old-days the city of Priam was famous the whole world over\rfor its wealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out\rof our houses, and much goods have been sold away to Phrygia and fair\rMeonia, for the hand of Jove has been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore,\rthat the son of scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here\rand to hem the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in this fool\'s\rwise among the people. You will have no man with you; it shall not\rbe; do all of you as I now say;- take your suppers in your companies\rthroughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakeful every man\rof you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let him gather\rthem and give them out among the people. Better let these, rather\rthan the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will arm and fight about\rthe ships; granted that Achilles has again come forward to defend\rthem, let it be as he will, but it shall go hard with him. I shall\rnot shun him, but will fight him, to fall or conquer. The god of war\rdeals out like measure to all, and the slayer may yet be slain."\r\rThus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted\rin applause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their understanding.\rThey gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words\rof Polydamas no man would heed. They took their supper throughout\rthe host, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans mourned\rPatroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid\rhis murderous hands upon the breast of his comrade, groaning again\rand again as a bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed\rhim of his young in some dense forest; when the lion comes back he\ris furious, and searches dingle and dell to track the hunter if he\rcan find him, for he is mad with rage- even so with many a sigh did\rAchilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, "Alas! vain were the words\rwith which I cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I said that\rI would bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had sacked\rIlius and taken his share of the spoils- but Jove does not give all\rmen their heart\'s desire. The same soil shall be reddened here at\rTroy by the blood of us both, for I too shall never be welcomed home\rby the old knight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even in this\rplace shall the earth cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroclus, now that\rI am left behind you, I will not bury you, till I have brought hither\rthe head and armour of mighty Hector who has slain you. Twelve noble\rsons of Trojans will I behead before your bier to avenge you; till\rI have done so you shall lie as you are by the ships, and fair women\rof Troy and Dardanus, whom we have taken with spear and strength of\rarm when we sacked men\'s goodly cities, shall weep over you both night\rand day." \r\rThen Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire that\rthey might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon they\rset a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threw sticks\ron to it to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played\rabout the belly of the tripod. When the water in the cauldron was\rboiling they washed the body, anointed it with oil, and closed its\rwounds with ointment that had been kept nine years. Then they laid\rit on a bier and covered it with a linen cloth from head to foot,\rand over this they laid a fair white robe. Thus all night long did\rthe Myrmidons gather round Achilles to mourn Patroclus. \r\rThen Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, "So, Queen Juno, you have\rgained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would think that\rthe Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood." \r\rAnd Juno answered, "Dread son of Saturn, why should you say this thing?\rMay not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than we do,\rdo what he can for another person? And shall not I- foremost of all\rgoddesses both by descent and as wife to you who reign in heaven-\rdevise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?" \r\rThus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of Vulcan,\rimperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes in heaven, a\rhouse of bronze wrought by the lame god\'s own hands. She found him\rbusy with his bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was making\rtwenty tripods that were to stand by the wall of his house, and he\rset wheels of gold under them all that they might go of their own\rselves to the assemblies of the gods, and come back again- marvels\rindeed to see. They were finished all but the ears of cunning workmanship\rwhich yet remained to be fixed to them: these he was now fixing, and\rhe was hammering at the rivets. While he was thus at work silver-footed\rThetis came to the house. Charis, of graceful head-dress, wife to\rthe far-famed lame god, came towards her as soon as she saw her, and\rtook her hand in her own, saying, "Why have you come to our house,\rThetis, honoured and ever welcome- for you do not visit us often?\rCome inside and let me set refreshment before you." \r\rThe goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a richly\rdecorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under\rher feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, "Vulcan, come here, Thetis\rwants you"; and the far-famed lame god answered, "Then it is indeed\ran august and honoured goddess who has come here; she it was that\rtook care of me when I was suffering from the heavy fall which I had\rthrough my cruel mother\'s anger- for she would have got rid of me\rbecause I was lame. It would have gone hardly with me had not Eurynome,\rdaughter of the ever-encircling waters of Oceanus, and Thetis, taken\rme to their bosom. Nine years did I stay with them, and many beautiful\rworks in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups, and chains, did I\rmake for them in their cave, with the roaring waters of Oceanus foaming\ras they rushed ever past it; and no one knew, neither of gods nor\rmen, save only Thetis and Eurynome who took care of me. If, then,\rThetis has come to my house I must make her due requital for having\rsaved me; entertain her, therefore, with all hospitality, while I\rput by my bellows and all my tools." \r\rOn this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legs\rplying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the fire, and\rgathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a sponge and\rwashed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donned\rhis shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door.\rThere were golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were like\rreal young women, with sense and reason, voice also and strength,\rand all the learning of the immortals; these busied themselves as\rthe king bade them, while he drew near to Thetis, seated her upon\ra goodly seat, and took her hand in his own, saying, "Why have you\rcome to our house, Thetis honoured and ever welcome- for you do not\rvisit us often? Say what you want, and I will do it for you at once\rif I can, and if it can be done at all." \r\rThetis wept and answered, "Vulcan, is there another goddess in Olympus\rwhom the son of Saturn has been pleased to try with so much affliction\ras he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses did he make subject\rto a mortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus, and sorely against my will\rdid I submit to the embraces of one who was but mortal, and who now\rstays at home worn out with age. Neither is this all. Heaven vouchsafed\rme a son, hero among heroes, and he shot up as a sapling. I tended\rhim as a plant in a goodly garden and sent him with his ships to Ilius\rto fight the Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house\rof Peleus. So long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun,\rhe is in heaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him; King\rAgamemnon has made him give up the maiden whom the sons of the Achaeans\rhad awarded him, and he wastes with sorrow for her sake. Then the\rTrojans hemmed the Achaeans in at their ships\' sterns and would not\rlet them come forth; the elders, therefore, of the Argives besought\rAchilles and offered him great treasure, whereon he refused to bring\rdeliverance to them himself, but put his own armour on Patroclus and\rsent him into the fight with much people after him. All day long they\rfought by the Scaean gates and would have taken the city there and\rthen, had not Apollo vouchsafed glory to Hector and slain the valiant\rson of Menoetius after he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore\rI am suppliant at your knees if haply you may be pleased to provide\rmy son, whose end is near at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly\rgreaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost\rhis own when his true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and\rhe now lies stretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul."\r\rAnd Vulcan answered, "Take heart, and be no more disquieted about\rthis matter; would that I could hide him from death\'s sight when his\rhour is come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amaze\rthe eyes of all who behold it." \r\rWhen he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning them\rtowards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellows\rblew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some\rfierce to help him when he had need of them, and others less strong\ras Vulcan willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper\rinto the fire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil\ron its block, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he\rtook the tongs in the other. \r\rFirst he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all over\rand binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; and\rthe baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five thicknesses,\rand with many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it. \r\rHe wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at her\rfull and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face\rof heaven- the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which\rmen also call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing.\rOrion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus. \r\rHe wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of men.\rIn the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were going about\rthe city with brides whom they were escorting by torchlight from their\rchambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and the youths danced to the\rmusic of flute and lyre, while the women stood each at her house door\rto see them. \r\rMeanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a quarrel,\rand two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a man who had\rbeen killed, the one saying before the people that he had paid damages\rin full, and the other that he had not been paid. Each was trying\rto make his own case good, and the people took sides, each man backing\rthe side that he had taken; but the heralds kept them back, and the\relders sate on their seats of stone in a solemn circle, holding the\rstaves which the heralds had put into their hands. Then they rose\rand each in his turn gave judgement, and there were two talents laid\rdown, to be given to him whose judgement should be deemed the fairest.\r\rAbout the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming armour,\rand they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it and accept\rthe half of what it contained. But the men of the city would not yet\rconsent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wives and little\rchildren kept guard upon the walls, and with them were the men who\rwere past fighting through age; but the others sallied forth with\rMars and Pallas Minerva at their head- both of them wrought in gold\rand clad in golden raiment, great and fair with their armour as befitting\rgods, while they that followed were smaller. When they reached the\rplace where they would lay their ambush, it was on a riverbed to which\rlive stock of all kinds would come from far and near to water; here,\rthen, they lay concealed, clad in full armour. Some way off them there\rwere two scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of sheep or\rcattle, which presently came, followed by two shepherds who were playing\ron their pipes, and had not so much as a thought of danger. When those\rwho were in ambush saw this, they cut off the flocks and herds and\rkilled the shepherds. Meanwhile the besiegers, when they heard much\rnoise among the cattle as they sat in council, sprang to their horses,\rand made with all speed towards them; when they reached them they\rset battle in array by the banks of the river, and the hosts aimed\rtheir bronze-shod spears at one another. With them were Strife and\rRiot, and fell Fate who was dragging three men after her, one with\ra fresh wound, and the other unwounded, while the third was dead,\rand she was dragging him along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled\rin men\'s blood. They went in and out with one another and fought as\rthough they were living people haling away one another\'s dead.\r\rHe wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed already.\rMany men were working at the plough within it, turning their oxen\rto and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned on reaching\rthe headland a man would come up to them and give them a cup of wine,\rand they would go back to their furrows looking forward to the time\rwhen they should again reach the headland. The part that they had\rploughed was dark behind them, so that the field, though it was of\rgold, still looked as if it were being ploughed- very curious to behold.\r\rHe wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were reaping\rwith sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell to the\rground in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound them\rin bands of twisted straw. There were three binders, and behind them\rthere were boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kept on bringing\rthem to be bound: among them all the owner of the land stood by in\rsilence and was glad. The servants were getting a meal ready under\ran oak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and were busy cutting\rhim up, while the women were making a porridge of much white barley\rfor the labourers\' dinner. \r\rHe wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines\rwere loaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but the\rvines were trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metal\rall round it, and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only one\rpath to it, and by this the vintagers went when they would gather\rthe vintage. Youths and maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried\rthe luscious fruit in plaited baskets; and with them there went a\rboy who made sweet music with his lyre, and sang the Linus-song with\rhis clear boyish voice. \r\rHe wrought also a herd of homed cattle. He made the cows of gold and\rtin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go\rand feed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river.\rAlong with the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold,\rand their nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions had fastened\ron a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and bellow as\rhe might they haled him, while the dogs and men gave chase: the lions\rtore through the bull\'s thick hide and were gorging on his blood and\rbowels, but the herdsmen were afraid to do anything, and only hounded\ron their dogs; the dogs dared not fasten on the lions but stood by\rbarking and keeping out of harm\'s way. \r\rThe god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and large\rflock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered sheepfolds.\r\rFurthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once made\rin Cnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths and maidens\rwhom all would woo, with their hands on one another\'s wrists. The\rmaidens wore robes of light linen, and the youths well woven shirts\rthat were slightly oiled. The girls were crowned with garlands, while\rthe young men had daggers of gold that hung by silver baldrics; sometimes\rthey would dance deftly in a ring with merry twinkling feet, as it\rwere a potter sitting at his work and making trial of his wheel to\rsee whether it will run, and sometimes they would go all in line with\rone another, and much people was gathered joyously about the green.\rThere was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two\rtumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck\rup with his tune. \r\rAll round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream\rof the river Oceanus. \r\rThen when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made\ra breastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made helmet,\rclose fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume\roverhanging it; and he made greaves also of beaten tin. \r\rLastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took it\rand set it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like\ra falcon from the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleaming\rarmour from the house of Vulcan. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XIX\r\rNow when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of\rOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the\rships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son\rfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also\rof his followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came\ramong them she clasped his hand in her own, saying, "My son, grieve\ras we may we must let this man lie, for it is by heaven\'s will that\rhe has fallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly\rarmour, which no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders."\r\rAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out bravely\ras she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none dared\rlook full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to\rstill greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for\rhe was glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had\rmade him. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at\rit, he said to his mother, "Mother, the god has given me armour, meet\rhandiwork for an immortal and such as no living could have fashioned;\rI will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon the son\rof Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his body, now\rhe is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot." \r\rSilver-footed Thetis answered, "My son, be not disquieted about this\rmatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome\rflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle.\rHe may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound\ras ever, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly;\runsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might\rand main." \r\rAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she\rthen dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus,\rthat his body might suffer no change. \r\rThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called\ron the Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always\rat the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were\rabout the ships and served out rations, all came to the place of assembly\rbecause Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so long\rfrom fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus, came\rlimping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless they came,\rand took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of all\rcame Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of Antenor\rhad struck him with a spear in battle. \r\rWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, "Son of\rAtreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,\rwhen we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would\rhave been better, had Diana\'s arrow slain her at the ships on the\rday when I took her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an\rAchaean the less would have bitten dust before the foe in the days\rof my anger. It has been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the\rAchaeans will long indeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let\rit be, for it is over. If we have been angry, necessity has schooled\rour anger. I put it from me: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore,\rbid the Achaeans arm forthwith that I may go out against the Trojans,\rand learn whether they will be in a mind to sleep by the ships or\rno. Glad, I ween, will he be to rest his knees who may fly my spear\rwhen I wield it." \r\rThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away\rhis anger. \r\rThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the\rmiddle of the assembly. "Danaan heroes," said he, "servants of Mars,\rit is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not\rseemly to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised\rspeaker. Who can either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest\rorator will be disconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus,\rand do you other Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the\rAchaeans spoken to me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was\rnot I that did it: Jove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in darkness\rstruck me mad when we were assembled on the day that I took from Achilles\rthe meed that had been awarded to him. What could I do? All things\rare in the hand of heaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove\'s daughters,\rshuts men\'s eyes to their destruction. She walks delicately, not on\rthe solid earth, but hovers over the heads of men to make them stumble\ror to ensnare them. \r\r"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest whether\rof gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him on the\rday when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair city\rof Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, \'Hear me all gods\rand goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day shall\ran Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child\rinto the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him who\rare of my blood and lineage.\' Then said Juno all crafty and full of\rguile, \'You will play false, and will not hold to your word. Swear\rme, O Olympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day\rfall between the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell\rabout him who are of your blood and lineage.\' \r\r"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath,\rto his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high summit\rof Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that\rthe noble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with\rchild and in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth though\rthere was a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena,\rand kept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of\rSaturn, and said, \'Father Jove, lord of the lightning- I have a word\rfor your ear. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son\rto Sthenelus the son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well,\rtherefore, that he should reign over the Argives.\' \r\r"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught\rFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she again\rinvade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then\rhe whirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down\rfrom heaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he\rwas ever angry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel\rlabours that Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty\rHector was killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time I\rkept thinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove\rrobbed me of my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much\rtreasure by way of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your\rpeople with you. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you yesterday\rin your tents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain\rfight at once, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship,\rthat you may see whether what I give you is enough." \r\rAnd Achilles answered, "Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you\rcan give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them:\rit is in your own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not\rwell to tarry talking about trifles, for there is a deed which is\ras yet to do. Achilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost,\rand laying low the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one\rof you when he is fighting." \r\rThen Ulysses said, "Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans\rthus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will\rbe no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both\rsides with fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the\rships, for in this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle\rthe livelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food;\rhowever much he may want to fight his strength will fail him before\rhe knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will\rgrow weary under him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed\rwith meat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay\rtill he has routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and\rbid them prepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts\rin presence of the assembly, that all may see them and you may be\rsatisfied. Moreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that\rhe has never gone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her\rafter the manner of men and women; and do you, too, show yourself\rof a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with\ra feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full.\rAs for you, son of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future;\rit is no disgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he\rwas wrong in the first instance." \r\rAnd King Agamemnon answered, "Son of Laertes, your words please me\rwell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would\rhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the\rname of heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would\rfain fight at once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come\rfrom my tent and we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do\rI charge you: take some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from\rmy tents the gifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring\rthe women also; furthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those\rthat are with the host, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and\rto the sun." \r\rThen said Achilles, "Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to\rthese matters at some other season, when there is breathing time and\rwhen I am calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those\rwhom Hector son of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain?\rLet the sons of the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and without food,\rtill we have avenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun\rlet them eat their fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying dead in my\rtent, all hacked and hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades\rare mourning round him. Therefore I can take thought of nothing save\ronly slaughter and blood and the rattle in the throat of the dying."\r\rUlysses answered, "Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the Achaeans,\rin battle you are better than I, and that more than a little, but\rin counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater knowledge.\rTherefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of which\rmen soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is wars steward, weighs the upshot,\rit may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped is\rfar heavier than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should\rmourn the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick and threefold\rcontinually; when should we have respite from our sorrow? Let us mourn\rour dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but let those\rof us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight our foes\rmore fiercely. In that hour let no man hold back, waiting for a second\rsummons; such summons shall bode ill for him who is found lagging\rbehind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and loose the\rfury of war upon the Trojans." \r\rWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with\rMeges son of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes,\rand Melanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The\rword was not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out\rthe seven tripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty metal\rcauldrons and the twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled\rin useful arts, seven in number, with Briseis, which made eight. Ulysses\rweighed out the ten talents of gold and then led the way back, while\rthe young Achaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid them in\rthe middle of the assembly. \r\rAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a\rgod came to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife which\rhe wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting\roff some bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as\rhe did so. The other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly\rto hear the king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and\rprayed saying, "I call Jove the first and mightiest of all gods to\rwitness, I call also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who dwell below\rand take vengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that I have laid\rno hand upon the girl Briseis, neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise,\rbut that she has remained in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely\rmay heaven visit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those\rwho perjure themselves." \r\rHe cut the boar\'s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled it\rround his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes.\rThen Achilles also rose and said to the Argives, "Father Jove, of\ra truth you blind men\'s eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had\rnot else stirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken\rBriseis from me against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled\rthe destruction of many an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that\rwe may begin fighting." \r\rOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\rship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to\rthe ship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the stable-men\rdrove the horses in among the others. \r\rBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of Patroclus,\rflung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her breast, her neck,\rand her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful as a goddess she\rwept and said, "Patroclus, dearest friend, when I went hence I left\ryou living; I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows\rmultiply upon me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father\rand mother married me, cut down before our city, and my three own\rdear brothers perished with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus,\reven when Achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes,\rtold me that I was not to weep, for you said you would make Achilles\rmarry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, we should have a wedding\rfeast among the Myrmidons. You were always kind to me and I shall\rnever cease to grieve for you." \r\rShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making as\rthough their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was weeping\rfor her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round Achilles\rand prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. "I\rpray you," said he, "if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat\rnor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even\rto the going down of the sun." \r\rOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of\rAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who\rstayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow:\rbut he would not be comforted till he should have flung himself into\rthe jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of\rPatroclus. Then he said- \r\r"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner\rready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were hasting\rto fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and drink\rin my tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this I\rcould not know, not even though I were to hear of the death of my\rfather, who is now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who\ram here fighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake\rof Helen, nor yet though I should hear that my son is no more- he\rwho is being brought up in Scyros- if indeed Neoptolemus is still\rliving. Till now I made sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy\raway from Argos, while you were to return to Phthia, bring back my\rson with you in your own ship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen,\rand the greatness of my house- for Peleus must surely be either dead,\ror what little life remains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities\rof age and ever present fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of\rmy death." \r\rHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought\ron what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn looked down\rwith pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, "My child, you\rhave quite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of your\rrecollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss\rof his dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner\rhe will neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar and ambrosia\rinto his breast, that he may know no hunger." \r\rWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.\rShe darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing\ron his broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming\rthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosia\rinto Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail\rhim, she went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the\rchill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne on the keen\rblasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming helmets,\rthe bossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the ashen\rspears stream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the whole\rland was radiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of the\rtramp of their treading rose from under their feet. In the midst of\rthem all Achilles put on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes\rgleamed like fire, for his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus,\rthen, full of fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of the\rgod, the armour that Vulcan had made him. \r\rFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and next\rhe did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the silver-studded\rsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield so\rgreat and strong that shone afar with a splendour as of the moon.\rAs the light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a\rfire in their homestead high up among the mountains, but the sailors\rare carried out to sea by wind and storm far from the haven where\rthey would be- even so did the gleam of Achilles\' wondrous shield\rstrike up into the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet, and\rset it upon his head, from whence it shone like a star, and the golden\rplumes which Vulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved\rall around it. Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armour to\rsee whether it fitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under\rit, and it seemed to buoy him up as though it had been wings.\r\rHe also drew his father\'s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so\rgreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles\rhad strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash from the\rtopmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus,\rfraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied themselves\rwith the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast about\rthem, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the reins back towards\rthe chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind the horses,\rand after him Achilles mounted in full armour, resplendent as the\rsun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he chided with his father\'s\rhorses saying, "Xanthus and Balius, famed offspring of Podarge- this\rtime when we have done fighting be sure and bring your driver safely\rback to the host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him dead on the\rplain as you did Patroclus." \r\rThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke- for white-armed Juno had\rendowed him with human speech- and he bowed his head till his mane\rtouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. "Dread\rAchilles," said he, "we will indeed save you now, but the day of your\rdeath is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be heaven\rand stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth\ror slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus of his\rarmour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him\ras he fought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector.\rWe two can fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetest of\rall winds; nevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a man\rand of a god." \r\rWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles\ranswered him in great sadness, saying, "Why, O Xanthus, do you thus\rforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to\rfall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,\rshall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of fighting."\r\rSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.\r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XX\r\rThus, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son\rof Peleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over against\rthem armed upon the rise of the plain. \r\rMeanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis gather\rthe gods in council, whereon she went about and called them to the\rhouse of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nor a\rsingle one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of rivers\rand meadows of green grass. When they reached the house of cloud-compelling\rJove, they took their seats in the arcades of polished marble which\rVulcan with his consummate skill had made for father Jove.\r\rIn such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove. Neptune\ralso, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the goddess, and\rcame up out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in the midst of\rthem, he asked what Jove\'s purpose might be. "Why," said he, "wielder\rof the lightning, have you called the gods in council? Are you considering\rsome matter that concerns the Trojans and Achaeans- for the blaze\rof battle is on the point of being kindled between them?"\r\rAnd Jove answered, "You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and wherefore\rI have called you hither. I take thought for them even in their destruction.\rFor my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt. Olympus and look on\rin peace, but do you others go about among Trojans and Achaeans, and\rhelp either side as you may be severally disposed. If Achilles fights\rthe Trojans without hindrance they will make no stand against him;\rthey have ever trembled at the sight of him, and now that he is roused\rto such fury about his comrade, he will override fate itself and storm\rtheir city." \r\rThus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took their\rseveral sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva, earth-encircling\rNeptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellent in all cunning-\rall these joined the host that came from the ships; with them also\rcame Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with his thin legs\rplying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined the Trojans,\rand with him Apollo of locks unshorn, and the archer goddess Diana,\rLeto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus. \r\rSo long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the\rAchaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fight\rwas now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him\rfor fear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his\rarmour, and looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympians\rcame to take their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife,\rrouser of hosts, and Minerva raised her loud voice, now standing by\rthe deep trench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with all\rher might upon the shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed out\rupon the other side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called\ron the Trojans at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and\rnow speeding up the side of the river Simois till he came to the hill\rCallicolone. \r\rThus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce contention\ralso among themselves. The sire of gods and men thundered from heaven\rabove, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth, and bade the\rhigh hills tremble. The spurs and crests of many-fountained Ida quaked,\ras also the city of the Trojans and the ships of the Achaeans. Hades,\rking of the realms below, was struck with fear; he sprang panic-stricken\rfrom his throne and cried aloud in terror lest Neptune, lord of the\rearthquake, should crack the ground over his head, and lay bare his\rmouldy mansions to the sight of mortals and immortals- mansions so\rghastly grim that even the gods shudder to think of them. Such was\rthe uproar as the gods came together in battle. Apollo with his arrows\rtook his stand to face King Neptune, while Minerva took hers against\rthe god of war; the archer-goddess Diana with her golden arrows, sister\rof far-darting Apollo, stood to face Juno; Mercury the lusty bringer\rof good luck faced Leto, while the mighty eddying river whom men can\rScamander, but gods Xanthus, matched himself against Vulcan.\r\rThe gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the heart\rof Achilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it was with\rhis blood that he longed above all things else to glut the stubborn\rlord of battle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attack the son of\rPeleus, and put courage into his heart, speaking with the voice of\rLycaon son of Priam. In his likeness therefore, he said to Aeneas,\r"Aeneas, counsellor of the Trojans, where are now the brave words\rwith which you vaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes, saying\rthat you would fight Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?"\r\rAnd Aeneas answered, "Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son of\rPeleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, it\rwould not be for the first time. His spear has already put me to Right\rfrom Ida, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus and Pedasus;\rJove indeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to fly, else\rhad the fallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, who went before\rhim to protect him and urged him to fall upon the Lelegae and Trojans.\rNo man may fight Achilles, for one of the gods is always with him\ras his guardian angel, and even were it not so, his weapon flies ever\rstraight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him who is against\rhim; if heaven would let me fight him on even terms he should not\rsoon overcome me, though he boasts that he is made of bronze."\r\rThen said King Apollo, son to Jove, "Nay, hero, pray to the ever-living\rgods, for men say that you were born of Jove\'s daughter Venus, whereas\rAchilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus is child to Jove,\rwhile Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea. Bring, therefore,\ryour spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare you with his taunts\rand menaces." \r\rAs he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his people,\rand he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremost fighters.\rNor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed Juno,\ras he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She called the\rgods about her, and said, "Look to it, you two, Neptune and Minerva,\rand consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas\rclad in full armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turn him back at once,\ror shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow him with strength so\rthat his heart fail not, and he may learn that the chiefs of the immortals\rare on his side, while the others who have all along been defending\rthe Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all come down from Olympus\rand join in the fight, that this day he may take no hurt at the hands\rof the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whatever fate may have spun\rout for him when he was begotten and his mother bore him. If Achilles\rbe not thus assured by the voice of a god, he may come to fear presently\rwhen one of us meets him in battle, for the gods are terrible if they\rare seen face to face." \r\rNeptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, "Juno, restrain\ryour fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcing the other\rgods to fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our own side;\rlet us take our places on some hill out of the beaten track, and let\rmortals fight it out among themselves. If Mars or Phoebus Apollo begin\rfighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannot fight, we too,\rwill at once raise the cry of battle, and in that case they will soon\rleave the field and go back vanquished to Olympus among the other\rgods." \r\rWith these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high earth-barrow\rof Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by the Trojans and\rPallas Minerva for him fly to when the sea-monster was chasing him\rfrom the shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and those that were with\rhim took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud of darkness; but the\rother gods seated themselves on the brow of Callicolone round you,\rO Phoebus, and Mars the waster of cities. \r\rThus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side\rwas willing to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seat\ron high was in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain was\ralive with men and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. The\rearth rang again under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards\reach other, and two champions, by far the foremost of them all, met\rbetween the hosts to fight- to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises, and noble\rAchilles. \r\rAeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet tossing\rdefiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before his breast,\rand brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from the other\rside sprang forth to meet him, fike some fierce lion that the whole\rcountry-side has met to hunt and kill- at first he bodes no ill, but\rwhen some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouches openmouthed,\rhis jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tail from side to\rside about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springs straight before\rhim, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slain among the foremost\rof his foes- even with such fury did Achilles burn to spring upon\rAeneas. \r\rWhen they were now close up with one another Achilles was first to\rspeak. "Aeneas," said he, "why do you stand thus out before the host\rto fight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the\rseat of Priam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom\rover to you. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his\rown. Or have the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness,\rfair with orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? This\ryou shall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have you\rforgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds helter-skelter\rdown the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to look behind you;\ryou took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the city, and with the\rhelp of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it and carried its women\rinto captivity, though Jove and the other gods rescued you. You think\rthey will protect you now, but they will not do so; therefore I say\rgo back into the host, and do not face me, or you will rue it. Even\ra fool may be wise after the event." \r\rThen Aeneas answered, "Son of Peleus, think not that your words can\rscare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can brag and\rtalk unseemly. We know one another\'s race and parentage as matters\rof common fame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor I\ryours. Men say that you are son to noble Peleus, and that your mother\ris Thetis, fair-haired daughter of the sea. I have noble Anchises\rfor my father, and Venus for my mother; the parents of one or other\rof us shall this day mourn a son, for it will be more than silly talk\rthat shall part us when the fight is over. Learn, then, my lineage\rif you will- and it is known to many. \r\r"In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded Dardania,\rfor Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men to dwell in,\rand her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained Ida. Dardanus\rhad a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest of all men living;\rhe had three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and\rtheir foals with them. Boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding,\rand covered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve\rfilly foals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped\rover the rich plain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of corn\rand not break them; or again when they would disport themselves on\rthe broad back of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker.\rErichthonius begat Tros, king of the Trojans, and Tros had three noble\rsons, Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men;\rwherefore the gods carried him off to be Jove\'s cupbearer, for his\rbeauty\'s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals. Ilus begat\rLaomedon, and Laomedon begat Tithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and\rHiketaon of the stock of Mars. But Assaracus was father to Capys,\rand Capys to Anchises, who was my father, while Hector is son to Priam.\r\r"Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove gives\rit or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now let there\rbe no more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were children.\rWe could fling taunts without end at one another; a hundred-oared\rgalley would not hold them. The tongue can run all whithers and talk\rall wise; it can go here and there, and as a man says, so shall he\rbe gainsaid. What is the use of our bandying hard like women who when\rthey fall foul of one another go out and wrangle in the streets, one\rhalf true and the other lies, as rage inspires them? No words of yours\rshall turn me now that I am fain to fight- therefore let us make trial\rof one another with our spears." \r\rAs he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield of\rAchilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleus\rheld the shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid,\rfor he deemed that Aeneas\'s spear would go through it quite easily,\rnot reflecting that the god\'s glorious gifts were little likely to\ryield before the blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas\'s spear did\rnot pierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed\rthe point. It went through two layers, but the god had made the shield\rin five, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, and one of\rgold; it was in this that the spear was stayed. \r\rAchilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas\rat the very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelian\rash went clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas\rwas afraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him;\rthe spear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the\rground, after having gone through both circles of the sheltering shield.\rAeneas though he had avoided the spear, stood still, blinded with\rfear and grief because the weapon had gone so near him; then Achilles\rsprang furiously upon him, with a cry as of death and with his keen\rblade drawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that two men,\ras men now are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas wielded it\rquite easily. \r\rAeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards\rhim, either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, and\rAchilles would have closed with him and despatched him with his sword,\rhad not Neptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said\rforthwith to the immortals, "Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, who\rwill now go down to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son of Peleus.\rFool that he was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo. Apollo will\rnever save him from destruction. Why should this man suffer when he\ris guiltless, to no purpose, and in another\'s quarrel? Has he not\rat all times offered acceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in\rheaven? Let us then snatch him from death\'s jaws, lest the son of\rSaturn be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fated, moreover, that\rhe should escape, and that the race of Dardanus, whom Jove loved above\rall the sons born to him of mortal women, shall not perish utterly\rwithout seed or sign. For now indeed has Jove hated the blood of Priam,\rwhile Aeneas shall reign over the Trojans, he and his children\'s children\rthat shall be born hereafter." \r\rThen answered Juno, "Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, and\rconsider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer him,\rbrave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of Peleus.\rFor of a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn full many\ra time before all the immortals, that never would we shield Trojans\rfrom destruction, not even when all Troy is burning in the flames\rthat the Achaeans shall kindle." \r\rWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle amid\rthe clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles and Aeneas\rwere. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son of Peleus,\rdrew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of Aeneas, and\rlaid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas on high from\roff the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of many a band\rof warriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god\'s hand sped\rhim, till he came to the very fringe of the battle where the Cauconians\rwere arming themselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of the earth, then\rcame near to him and said, Aeneas, what god has egged you on to this\rfolly in fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a mightier man of\rvalour and more beloved of heaven than you are? Give way before him\rwhensoever you meet him, lest you go down to the house of Hades even\rthough fate would have it otherwise. When Achilles is dead you may\rthen fight among the foremost undaunted, for none other of the Achaeans\rshall slay you." \r\rThe god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at\ronce removed the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who opened\rthem wide indeed and said in great anger, "Alas! what marvel am I\rnow beholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not him\rwhom I meant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also must\rbe under heaven\'s protection, although I had thought his boasting\rwas idle. Let him go hang; he will be in no mood to fight me further,\rseeing how narrowly he has missed being killed. I will now give my\rorders to the Danaans and attack some other of the Trojans."\r\rHe sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did\rso. "Let not the Trojans," he cried, "keep you at arm\'s length, Achaeans,\rbut go for them and fight them man for man. However valiant I may\rbe, I cannot give chase to so many and fight all of them. Even Mars,\rwho is an immortal, or Minerva, would shrink from flinging himself\rinto the jaws of such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless,\rso far as in me lies I will show no slackness of hand or foot nor\rwant of endurance, not even for a moment; I will utterly break their\rranks, and woe to the Trojan who shall venture within reach of my\rspear." \r\rThus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans\rand declared that he would fight Achilles. "Be not afraid, proud Trojans,"\rsaid he, "to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if\rthe battle were one of words only, but they would be more than a match\rfor me, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deed of Achilles\rwill fall somewhat short of his word; he will do in part, and the\rother part he will clip short. I will go up against him though his\rhands be as fire- though his hands be fire and his strength iron."\r\rThus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the Achaeans,\rand raised the cry of battle as they flung themselves into the midst\rof their ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector and said, "Hector,\ron no account must you challenge Achilles to single combat; keep a\rlookout for him while you are under cover of the others and away from\rthe thick of the fight, otherwise he will either hit you with a spear\ror cut you down at close quarters." \r\rThus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was afraid\rwhen he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then sprang upon\rthe Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with a garment.\rFirst he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of much people\rwhom a naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities, in the\rland of Hyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achilles struck\rhim full on the head as he was coming on towards him, and split it\rclean in two; whereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles vaunted\rover him saying, "You he low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; your\rdeath is here, but your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your\rfather\'s estate lies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters\rof Hermus." \r\rThus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The\rchariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him\rin the front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon,\ra valiant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple\rthrough his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the spear,\rbut it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain inside was\rshed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended. Then he\rstruck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down from his\rchariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He breathed his last,\rbellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him to offer\rhim in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of the earth-shaker\ris glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying. Achilles then went\rin pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his father had always forbidden\rto fight because he was the youngest of his sons, the one he loved\rbest, and the fastest runner. He, in his folly and showing off the\rfleetness of his feet, was rushing about among front ranks until he\rlost his life, for Achilles struck him in the middle of the back as\rhe was darting past him: he struck him just at the golden fastenings\rof his belt and where the two pieces of the double breastplate overlapped.\rThe point of the spear pierced him through and came out by the navel,\rwhereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a cloud of darkness overshadowed\rhim as he sank holding his entrails in his hands. \r\rWhen Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his hands\rand sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and he\rcould not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised his\rspear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. When Achilles\rsaw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, "This is he that has\rwounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. Not\rfor long shall we two quail before one another on the highways of\rwar." \r\rHe looked fiercely on Hector and said, "Draw near, that you may meet\ryour doom the sooner." Hector feared him not and answered, "Son of\rPeleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a\rchild; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you\rare a mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue\rlies in the the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may\rnot slay you with my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now."\r\rHe hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, and\rthough she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from going\rtowards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet\rin front of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud\rcry, bent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god\rcan, and hid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards\rhim spear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air.\rWhen he rushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god,\rhe shouted aloud saying, "Hound, this time too you have escaped death-\rbut of a truth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom\rit seems you pray before you go into battle, has again saved you;\rbut if I too have any friend among the gods I will surely make an\rend of you when I come across you at some other time. Now, however,\rI will pursue and overtake other Trojans." \r\rOn this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his neck,\rand he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and stayed\rDemouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great stature,\rby hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him with his\rsword and killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus and Dardanus,\rsons of Bias, and threw them from their chariot, the one with a blow\rfrom a thrown spear, while the other he cut down in hand-to-hand fight.\rThere was also Tros the son of Alastor- he came up to Achilles and\rclasped his knees in the hope that he would spare him and not kill\rhim but let him go, because they were both of the same age. Fool,\rhe might have known that he should not prevail with him, for the man\rwas in no mood for pity or forbearance but was in grim earnest. Therefore\rwhen Tros laid hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers,\rAchilles drove his sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling\rout, while his bosom was all covered with the black blood that welled\rfrom the wound. Thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless.\r\rAchilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with a spear,\rand the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. He also\rstruck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which became\rwarm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes of\rEcheclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded Deucalion\rin the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon\rhe waited Achilles\' onset with his arm hanging down and death staring\rhim in the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blow from his sword\rand flung it helmet and all away from him, and the marrow came oozing\rout of his backbone as he lay. He then went in pursuit of Rhigmus,\rnoble son of Peires, who had come from fertile Thrace, and struck\rhim through the middle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly,\rso that he fell headlong from his chariot. He also speared Areithous\rsquire to Rhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses in flight,\rand thrust him from his chariot, while the horses were struck with\rpanic. \r\rAs a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought- and the\rdense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues of\rfire in every direction- even so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding\rhis spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom\rhe would slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokes\rbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor-\rand it is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle-\reven so did the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies\rof the slain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the\rcar were bespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses\'\rhoofs, and from the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed\ron to win still further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with\rgore. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XXI\r\rNow when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus,\rbegotten of immortal Jove, Achilles cut their forces in two: one half\rhe chased over the plain towards the city by the same way that the\rAchaeans had taken when flying panic-stricken on the preceding day\rwith Hector in full triumph; this way did they fly pell-mell, and\rJuno sent down a thick mist in front of them to stay them. The other\rhalf were hemmed in by the deep silver-eddying stream, and fell into\rit with a great uproar. The waters resounded, and the banks rang again,\ras they swam hither and thither with loud cries amid the whirling\reddies. As locusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire-\rthe flame comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they\rhuddle into the water- even so was the eddying stream of Xanthus filled\rwith the uproar of men and horses, all struggling in confusion before\rAchilles. \r\rForthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it against\ra tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god, armed with\rhis sword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed the Trojans down\ron every side. Their dying groans rose hideous as the sword smote\rthem, and the river ran red with blood. As when fish fly scared before\ra huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some fair haven-\rfor he is sure to eat all he can catch- even so did the Trojans cower\runder the banks of the mighty river, and when Achilles\' arms grew\rweary with killing them, he drew twelve youths alive out of the water,\rto sacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son of Menoetius. He drew them\rout like dazed fawns, bound their hands behind them with the girdles\rof their own shirts, and gave them over to his men to take back to\rthe ships. Then he sprang into the river, thirsting for still further\rblood. \r\rThere he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he was escaping\rout of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisoner when he\rwas in his father\'s vineyard, having set upon him by night, as he\rwas cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wicker sides\rof a chariot. Achilles then caught him to his sorrow unawares, and\rsent him by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him. But\ra guest-friend, Eetion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum, and\rsent him to Arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to his father\'s\rhouse. He had spent eleven days happily with his friends after he\rhad come from Lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven again delivered him\rinto the hands of Achilles, who was to send him to the house of Hades\rsorely against his will. He was unarmed when Achilles caught sight\rof him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he any spear,\rfor he had thrown all his armour from him on to the bank, and was\rsweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so that his strength\rwas now failing him. \r\rThen Achilles said to himself in his surprise, "What marvel do I see\rhere? If this man can come back alive after having been sold over\rinto Lemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain rising\rfrom the world below. Could not even the waters of the grey sea imprison\rhim, as they do many another whether he will or no? This time let\rhim taste my spear, that I may know for certain whether mother earth\rwho can keep even a strong man down, will be able to hold him, or\rwhether thence too he will return." \r\rThus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed and\rtrying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die.\rAchilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lycaon\rran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passed\rover his back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was for\rblood. With one hand he caught Achilles\' knees as he besought him,\rand with the other he clutched the spear and would not let it go.\rThen he said, "Achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for I am\ryour suppliant. It was in your tents that I first broke bread on the\rday when you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you sold\raway to Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I brought you\rthe price of a hundred oxen. I have paid three times as much to gain\rmy freedom; it is but twelve days that I have come to Ilius after\rmuch suffering, and now cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands.\rSurely father Jove must hate me, that he has given me over to you\ra second time. Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me,\rdaughter of aged Altes- of Altes who reigns over the warlike Lelegae\rand holds steep Pedasus on the river Satnioeis. Priam married his\rdaughter along with many other women and two sons were born of her,\rboth of whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydorus\ras he was fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befall\rme, for I fear that I shall not escape you since heaven has delivered\rme over to you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart,\rspare me, for I am not of the same womb as Hector who slew your brave\rand noble comrade." \r\rWith such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles; but\rAchilles answered him sternly. "Idiot," said he, "talk not to me of\rransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the Trojans quarter,\rand sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive; but\rnow not a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my hands\rbefore the city of Ilius- and of all Trojans it shall fare hardest\rwith the sons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shall die. Why\rshould you whine in this way? Patroclus fell, and he was a better\rman than you are. I too- see you not how I am great and goodly? I\ram son to a noble father, and have a goddess for my mother, but the\rhands of doom and death overshadow me all as surely. The day will\rcome, either at dawn or dark, or at the noontide, when one shall take\rmy life also in battle, either with his spear, or with an arrow sped\rfrom his bow." \r\rThus did he speak, and Lycaon\'s heart sank within him. He loosed his\rhold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but Achilles\rdrew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck;\rhe plunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon\rhe lay at full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from\rhim till the earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot\rand flung him into the river to go down stream, vaunting over him\rthe while, and saying, "Lie there among the fishes, who will lick\rthe blood from your wound and gloat over it; your mother shall not\rlay you on any bier to mourn you, but the eddies of Scamander shall\rbear you into the broad bosom of the sea. There shall the fishes feed\ron the fat of Lycaon as they dart under the dark ripple of the waters-\rso perish all of you till we reach the citadel of strong Ilius- you\rin flight, and I following after to destroy you. The river with its\rbroad silver stream shall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls\ryou offered him and all the horses that you flung living into his\rwaters. None the less miserably shall you perish till there is not\ra man of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroclus and the\rhavoc you wrought among the Achaeans whom you have slain while I held\raloof from battle." \r\rSo spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and pondered\rwithin himself how he should stay the hand of Achilles and save the\rTrojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spear in hand,\rsprang upon Asteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill him. He was son to\rthe broad river Axius and Periboea eldest daughter of Acessamenus;\rfor the river had lain with her. Asteropaeus stood up out of the water\rto face him with a spear in either hand, and Xanthus filled him with\rcourage, being angry for the death of the youths whom Achilles was\rslaying ruthlessly within his waters. When they were close up with\rone another Achilles was first to speak. "Who and whence are you,"\rsaid he, "who dare to face me? Woe to the parents whose son stands\rup against me." And the son of Pelegon answered, "Great son of Peleus,\rwhy should you ask my lineage. I am from the fertile land of far Paeonia,\rcaptain of the Paeonians, and it is now eleven days that I am at Ilius.\rI am of the blood of the river Axius- of Axius that is the fairest\rof all rivers that run. He begot the famed warrior Pelegon, whose\rson men call me. Let us now fight, Achilles." \r\rThus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash.\rAsteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use both hands\ralike; with the one spear he struck Achilles\' shield, but did not\rpierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point;\rwith the other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles! right arm drawing\rdark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixed itself in the\rground, foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles, fain to kill\rhim, hurled his spear at Asteropaeus, but failed to hit him and struck\rthe steep bank of the river, driving the spear half its length into\rthe earth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword and sprang furiously\rupon him. Asteropaeus vainly tried to draw Achilles\' spear out of\rthe bank by main force; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his\rmight to draw it out, and thrice he had to leave off trying; the fourth\rtime he tried to bend and break it, but ere he could do so Achilles\rsmote him with his sword and killed him. He struck him in the belly\rnear the navel, so that all his bowels came gushing out on to the\rground, and the darkness of death came over him as he lay gasping.\rThen Achilles set his foot on his chest and spoiled him of his armour,\rvaunting over him and saying, "Lie there- begotten of a river though\ryou be, it is hard for you to strive with the offspring of Saturn\'s\rson. You declare yourself sprung from the blood of a broad river,\rbut I am of the seed of mighty Jove. My father is Peleus, son of Aeacus\rruler over the many Myrmidons, and Aeacus was the son of Jove. Therefore\ras Jove is mightier than any river that flows into the sea, so are\rhis children stronger than those of any river whatsoever. Moreover\ryou have a great river hard by if he can be of any use to you, but\rthere is no fighting against Jove the son of Saturn, with whom not\reven King Achelous can compare, nor the mighty stream of deep-flowing\rOceanus, from whom all rivers and seas with all springs and deep wells\rproceed; even Oceanus fears the lightnings of great Jove, and his\rthunder that comes crashing out of heaven." \r\rWith this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that he\rhad killed Asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the sand, with\rthe dark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busy nibbling\rand gnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. Then he went in chase\rof the Paeonians, who were flying along the bank of the river in panic\rwhen they saw their leader slain by the hands of the son of Peleus.\rTherein he slew Thersilochus, Mydon, Astypylus, Mnesus, Thrasius,\rOeneus, and Ophelestes, and he would have slain yet others, had not\rthe river in anger taken human form, and spoken to him from out the\rdeep waters saying, "Achilles, if you excel all in strength, so do\ryou also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with you to protect\ryou: if, then, the son of Saturn has vouchsafed it to you to destroy\rall the Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream, and do your\rgrim work on land. My fair waters are now filled with corpses, nor\rcan I find any channel by which I may pour myself into the sea for\rI am choked with dead, and yet you go on mercilessly slaying. I am\rin despair, therefore, O captain of your host, trouble me no further."\r\rAchilles answered, "So be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but I will\rnever cease dealing out death among the Trojans, till I have pent\rthem up in their city, and made trial of Hector face to face, that\rI may learn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him." \r\rAs he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of the gods.\rBut the river said to Apollo, "Surely, son of Jove, lord of the silver\rbow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who charged you straitly\rthat you should stand by the Trojans and defend them, till twilight\rfades, and darkness is over an the earth." \r\rMeanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon the\rriver raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his stream into\ra torrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slain and\rleft within his waters. These he cast out on to the land, bellowing\rlike a bull the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding them\rin his mighty eddies. The great and terrible wave gathered about Achilles,\rfalling upon him and beating on his shield, so that he could not keep\rhis feet; he caught hold of a great elm-tree, but it came up by the\rroots, and tore away the bank, damming the stream with its thick branches\rand bridging it all across; whereby Achilles struggled out of the\rstream, and fled full speed over the plain, for he was afraid.\r\rBut the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him\rwith a dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the Trojans from\rdestruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear\'s throw from him;\rswift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongest\rand fleetest of all birds, even so did he spring forward, and the\rarmour rang loudly about his breast. He fled on in front, but the\rriver with a loud roar came tearing after. As one who would water\rhis garden leads a stream from some fountain over his plants, and\rall his ground-spade in hand he clears away the dams to free the channels,\rand the little stones run rolling round and round with the water as\rit goes merrily down the bank faster than the man can follow- even\rso did the river keep catching up with Achilles albeit he was a fleet\rrunner, for the gods are stronger than men. As often as he would strive\rto stand his ground, and see whether or no all the gods in heaven\rwere in league against him, so often would the mighty wave come beating\rdown upon his shoulders, and be would have to keep flying on and on\rin great dismay; for the angry flood was tiring him out as it flowed\rpast him and ate the ground from under his feet. \r\rThen the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, "Father\rJove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and save\rme from the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards.\rI blame none of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do\rmy dear mother, who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was\rto fall under the walls of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; would\rthat Hector, the best man among the Trojans, might there slay me;\rthen should I fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seems\rthat I shall come to a most pitiable end, trapped in this river as\rthough I were some swineherd\'s boy, who gets carried down a torrent\rwhile trying to cross it during a storm." \r\rAs soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him\rin the likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him.\rNeptune spoke first. "Son of Peleus," said he, "be not so exceeding\rfearful; we are two gods, come with Jove\'s sanction to assist you,\rI, and Pallas Minerva. It is not your fate to perish in this river;\rhe will abate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise\ryou, if you will be guided by us, not to stay your hand from fighting\rtill you have pent the Trojan host within the famed walls of Ilius-\ras many of them as may escape. Then kill Hector and go back to the\rships, for we will vouchsafe you a triumph over him." \r\rWhen they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but Achilles\rstrove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge the gods had\rlaid upon him. All was now covered with the flood of waters, and much\rgoodly armour of the youths that had been slain was rifting about,\ras also many corpses, but he forced his way against the stream, speeding\rright onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him, for Minerva had\rendowed him with great strength. Nevertheless Scamander did not slacken\rin his pursuit, but was still more furious with the son of Peleus.\rHe lifted his waters into a high crest and cried aloud to Simois saying,\r"Dear brother, let the two of us unite to save this man, or he will\rsack the mighty city of King Priam, and the Trojans will not hold\rout against him. Help me at once; fill your streams with water from\rtheir sources, rouse all your torrents to a fury; raise your wave\ron high, and let snags and stones come thundering down you that we\rmay make an end of this savage creature who is now lording it as though\rhe were a god. Nothing shall serve him longer, not strength nor comeliness,\rnor his fine armour, which forsooth shall soon be lying low in the\rdeep waters covered over with mud. I will wrap him in sand, and pour\rtons of shingle round him, so that the Achaeans shall not know how\rto gather his bones for the silt in which I shall have hidden him,\rand when they celebrate his funeral they need build no barrow."\r\rOn this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles, seething\ras it was with foam and blood and the bo&ies of the dead. The dark\rwaters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmed the son\rof Peleus, but Juno, trembling lest Achilles should be swept away\rin the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out to\rVulcan her son. "Crook-foot," she cried, "my child, be up and doing,\rfor I deem it is with you that Xanthus is fain to fight; help us at\ronce, kindle a fierce fire; I will then bring up the west and the\rwhite south wind in a mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bear\rthe flames against the heads and armour of the Trojans and consume\rthem, while you go along the banks of Xanthus burning his trees and\rwrapping him round with fire. Let him not turn you back neither by\rfair words nor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Then\ryou may stay your flames." \r\rOn this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon the\rplain and burned the many dead whom Achilles had killed and whose\rbodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plain\rwas dried and the flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing on an orchard\rthat has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, and the heart\rof the owner is glad- even so the whole plan was dried and the dead\rbodies were consumed. Then he turned tongues of fire on to the river.\rHe burned the elms the willows and the tamarisks, the lotus also,\rwith the rushes and marshy herbage that grew abundantly by the banks\rof the river. The eels and fishes that go darting about everywhere\rin the water, these, too, were sorely harassed by the flames that\rcunning Vulcan had kindled, and the river himself was scalded, so\rthat he spoke saying, "Vulcan, there is no god can hold his own against\ryou. I cannot fight you when you flare out your flames in this way;\rstrive with me no longer. Let Achilles drive the Trojans out of city\rimmediately. What have I to do with quarrelling and helping people?"\r\rHe was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As a\rcauldron upon \'a large fire boils when it is melting the lard of some\rfatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the dry faggots\rblaze under it- even so were the goodly waters of Xanthus heated with\rthe fire till they were boiling. He could flow no longer but stayed\rhis stream, so afflicted was he by the blasts of fire which cunning\rVulcan had raised. Then he prayed to Juno and besought her saying,\r"Juno, why should your son vex my stream with such especial fury?\rI am not so much to blame as all the others are who have been helping\rthe Trojans. I will leave off, since you so desire it, and let son\rleave off also. Furthermore I swear never again will I do anything\rto save the Trojans from destruction, not even when all Troy is burning\rin the flames which the Achaeans will kindle." \r\rAs soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, "Son Vulcan,\rhold now your flames; we ought not to use such violence against a\rgod for the sake of mortals." \r\rWhen she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the river\rwent back once more into his own fair bed. \r\rXanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Juno stayed\rthem though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel broke out among\rthe other gods, for they were of divided counsels. They fell on one\ranother with a mighty uproar- earth groaned, and the spacious firmament\rrang out as with a blare of trumpets. Jove heard as he was sitting\ron Olympus, and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows\ramong themselves. They were not long about beginning, and Mars piercer\rof shields opened the battle. Sword in hand he sprang at once upon\rMinerva and reviled her. "Why, vixen," said he, "have you again set\rthe gods by the ears in the pride and haughtiness of your heart? Have\ryou forgotten how you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to wound me, and\ryourself took visible spear and drove it into me to the hurt of my\rfair body? You shall now suffer for what you then did to me."\r\rAs he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis- so terrible\rthat not even can Jove\'s lightning pierce it. Here did murderous Mars\rstrike her with his great spear. She drew back and with her strong\rhand seized a stone that was lying on the plain- great and rugged\rand black- which men of old had set for the boundary of a field. With\rthis she struck Mars on the neck, and brought him down. Nine roods\rdid he cover in his fall, and his hair was all soiled in the dust,\rwhile his armour rang rattling round him. But Minerva laughed and\rvaunted over him saying, "Idiot, have you not learned how far stronger\rI am than you, but you must still match yourself against me? Thus\rdo your mother\'s curses now roost upon you, for she is angry and would\rdo you mischief because you have deserted the Achaeans and are helping\rthe Trojans." \r\rShe then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove\'s daughter\rVenus took Mars by the hand and led him away groaning all the time,\rfor it was only with great difficulty that he had come to himself\ragain. When Queen Juno saw her, she said to Minerva, "Look, daughter\rof aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that vixen Venus is again taking\rMars through the crowd out of the battle; go after her at once."\r\rThus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made at\rher, striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she fell\rfainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at full\rlength. Then Minerva vaunted over her saying, "May all who help the\rTrojans against the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart\ras Venus did when she came across me while she was helping Mars. Had\rthis been so, we should long since have ended the war by sacking the\rstrong city of Ilius." \r\rJuno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollo\rsaying, "Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm\'s length? it\ris not well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will be disgraceful\rto us if we return to Jove\'s bronze-floored mansion on Olympus without\rhaving fought each other; therefore come on, you are the younger of\rthe two, and I ought not to attack you, for I am older and have had\rmore experience. Idiot, you have no sense, and forget how we two alone\rof all the gods fared hardly round about Ilius when we came from Jove\'s\rhouse and worked for Laomedon a whole year at a stated wage and he\rgave us his orders. I built the Trojans the wall about their city,\rso wide and fair that it might be impregnable, while you, Phoebus,\rherded cattle for him in the dales of many valleyed Ida. When, however,\rthe glad hours brought round the time of payment, mighty Laomedon\rrobbed us of all our hire and sent us off with nothing but abuse.\rHe threatened to bind us hand and foot and sell us over into some\rdistant island. He tried, moreover, to cut off the ears of both of\rus, so we went away in a rage, furious about the payment he had promised\rus, and yet withheld; in spite of all this, you are now showing favour\rto his people, and will not join us in compassing the utter ruin of\rthe proud Trojans with their wives and children." \r\rAnd King Apollo answered, "Lord of the earthquake, you would have\rno respect for me if I were to fight you about a pack of miserable\rmortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of the\rfield, and presently fall lifeless to the ground. Let us stay this\rfighting at once and let them settle it among themselves."\r\rHe turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the brother\rof his own father. But his sister the huntress Diana, patroness of\rwild beasts, was very angry with him and said, "So you would fly,\rFar-Darter, and hand victory over to Neptune with a cheap vaunt to\rboot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again hear you\rbragging in my father\'s house, as you have often done in the presence\rof the immortals, that you would stand up and fight with Neptune."\r\rApollo made her no answer, but Jove\'s august queen was angry and upbraided\rher bitterly. "Bold vixen," she cried, "how dare you cross me thus?\rFor all your bow you will find it hard to hold your own against me.\rJove made you as a lion among women, and lets you kill them whenever\ryou choose. You will And it better to chase wild beasts and deer upon\rthe mountains than to fight those who are stronger than you are. If\ryou would try war, do so, and find out by pitting yourself against\rme, how far stronger I am than you are." \r\rShe caught both Diana\'s wrists with her left hand as she spoke, and\rwith her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed as\rshe beat her with it about the ears while Diana wriggled and writhed\runder her blows. Her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and she\rfled weeping from under Juno\'s hand as a dove that flies before a\rfalcon to the cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune\rto escape. Even so did she fly weeping away, leaving her bow and arrows\rbehind her. \r\rThen the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto, "Leto,\rI shall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Jove\'s\rwives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that you worsted\rme in fair fight." \r\rLeto then gathered up Diana\'s bow and arrows that had fallen about\ramid the whirling dust, and when she had got them she made all haste\rafter her daughter. Diana had now reached Jove\'s bronze-floored mansion\ron Olympus, and sat herself down with many tears on the knees of her\rfather, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering all about her. The\rson of Saturn drew her towards him, and laughing pleasantly the while\rbegan to question her saying, "Which of the heavenly beings, my dear\rchild, has been treating you in this cruel manner, as though you had\rbeen misconducting yourself in the face of everybody?" and the fair-crowned\rgoddess of the chase answered, "It was your wife Juno, father, who\rhas been beating me; it is always her doing when there is any quarrelling\ramong the immortals." \r\rThus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered the strong\rcity of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not hold out\rand the Danaans should take the city then and there, before its hour\rhad come; but the rest of the ever-living gods went back, some angry\rand some triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seats beside\rJove lord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept on dealing\rout death alike on the Trojans and on their As when the smoke from\rsome burning city ascends to heaven when the anger of the gods has\rkindled it- there is then toil for all, and sorrow for not a few-\reven so did Achilles bring toil and sorrow on the Trojans.\r\rOld King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on huge\rAchilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and there\rwas none to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower and\rwith many a groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave\rwarders of the gate. "Keep the gates," said he, "wide open till the\rpeople come flying into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is driving\rthem in rout before him. I see we are in great peril. As soon as our\rpeople are inside and in safety, close the strong gates for I fear\rlest that terrible man should come bounding inside along with the\rothers." \r\rAs he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and when\rthese were opened there was a haven of refuge for the Trojans. Apollo\rthen came full speed out of the city to meet them and protect them.\rRight for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst and grimy\rwith dust, still they fied on, with Achilles wielding his spear furiously\rbehind them. For he was as one possessed, and was thirsting after\rglory. \r\rThen had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy if\rApollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to Antenor.\rHe put courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him,\rleaning against a beech tree and shrouded in thick darkness. When\rAgenor saw Achilles he stood still and his heart was clouded with\rcare. "Alas," said he to himself in his dismay, "if I fly before mighty\rAchilles, and go where all the others are being driven in rout, he\rwill none the less catch me and kill me for a coward. How would it\rbe were I to let Achilles drive the others before him, and then fly\rfrom the wall to the plain that is behind Ilius till I reach the spurs\rof Ida and can hide in the underwood that is thereon? I could then\rwash the sweat from off me in the river and in the evening return\rto Ilius. But why commune with myself in this way? Like enough he\rwould see me as I am hurrying from the city over the plain, and would\rspeed after me till he had caught me- I should stand no chance against\rhim, for he is mightiest of all mankind. What, then, if I go out and\rmeet him in front of the city? His flesh too, I take it, can be pierced\rby pointed bronze. Life is the same in one and all, and men say that\rhe is but mortal despite the triumph that Jove son of Saturn vouchsafes\rhim." \r\rSo saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was now\rfain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covert\rto attack a hunter- she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the baying\rof the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her and wound\rher either with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has pierced\rher she will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip\ror been killed outright- even so did noble Agenor son of Antenor refuse\rto fly till he had made trial of Achilles, and took aim at him with\rhis spear, holding his round shield before him and crying with a loud\rvoice. "Of a truth," said he, "noble Achilles, you deem that you shall\rthis day sack the city of the proud Trojans. Fool, there will be trouble\renough yet before it, for there is many a brave man of us still inside\rwho will stand in front of our dear parents with our wives and children,\rto defend Ilius. Here therefore, huge and mighty warrior though you\rbe, here shall you cue. \r\rAs he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the spear\rstruck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newly wrought\rtin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of him whom\rit had struck, and did not pierce it, for the gods gift stayed it.\rAchilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would not vouchsafe\rhim glory, for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in a thick mist,\rsending him out of the battle unmolested Then he craftily drew the\rson of Peleus away from going after the host, for he put on the semblance\rof Agenor and stood in front of Achilles, who ran towards him to give\rhim chase and pursued him over the corn lands of the plain, turning\rhim towards the deep waters of the river Scamander. Apollo ran but\ra little way before him and beguiled Achilles by making him think\rall the time that he was on the point of overtaking him. Meanwhile\rthe rabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd within the city\rtill their numbers thronged it; no longer did they dare wait for one\ranother outside the city walls, to learn who had escaped and who were\rfallen in fight, but all whose feet and knees could still carry them\rpoured pell-mell into the town. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XXII\r\rThus the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat\rfrom off them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the\rgoodly battlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon\rtheir shoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hector\rstay where he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then Phoebus\rApollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, "Why, son of Peleus, do\ryou, who are but man, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not\ryet found out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did\rnot harass the Trojans whom you had routed, and now they are within\rtheir walls, while you have been decoyed hither away from them. Me\ryou cannot kill, for death can take no hold upon me." \r\rAchilles was greatly angered and said, "You have baulked me, Far-Darter,\rmost malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from the wall,\rwhere many another man would have bitten the dust ere he got within\rIlius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved the Trojans\rat no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but I would\rindeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so."\r\rOn this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the winning\rhorse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is flying over\rthe plain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of Achilles bear\rhim onwards. King Priam was first to note him as he scoured the plain,\rall radiant as the star which men call Orion\'s Hound, and whose beams\rblaze forth in time of harvest more brilliantly than those of any\rother that shines by night; brightest of them all though he be, he\ryet bodes ill for mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train-\reven so did Achilles\' armour gleam on his breast as he sped onwards.\rPriam raised a cry and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them\rup and shouted out to his dear son, imploring him to return; but Hector\rstill stayed before the gates, for his heart was set upon doing battle\rwith Achilles. The old man reached out his arms towards him and bade\rhim for pity\'s sake come within the walls. "Hector," he cried, "my\rson, stay not to face this man alone and unsupported, or you will\rmeet death at the hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier than\ryou. Monster that he is; would indeed that the gods loved him no better\rthan I do, for so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay\rstretched on earth, and a load of grief would be lifted from my heart,\rfor many a brave son has he reft from me, either by killing them or\rselling them away in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now\rI miss two sons from among the Trojans who have thronged within the\rcity, Lycaon and Polydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore\rme. Should they be still alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we\rwill ransom them with gold and bronze, of which we have store, for\rthe old man Altes endowed his daughter richly; but if they are already\rdead and in the house of Hades, sorrow will it be to us two who were\rtheir parents; albeit the grief of others will be more short-lived\runless you too perish at the hands of Achilles. Come, then, my son,\rwithin the city, to be the guardian of Trojan men and Trojan women,\ror you will both lose your own life and afford a mighty triumph to\rthe son of Peleus. Have pity also on your unhappy father while life\ryet remains to him- on me, whom the son of Saturn will destroy by\ra terrible doom on the threshold of old age, after I have seen my\rsons slain and my daughters haled away as captives, my bridal chambers\rpillaged, little children dashed to earth amid the rage of battle,\rand my sons\' wives dragged away by the cruel hands of the Achaeans;\rin the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces at my own gates after\rsome one has beaten the life out of my body with sword or spear-hounds\rthat I myself reared and fed at my own table to guard my gates, but\rwho will yet lap my blood and then lie all distraught at my doors.\rWhen a young man falls by the sword in battle, he may lie where he\ris and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be seen, all is honourable\rin death, but when an old man is slain there is nothing in this world\rmore pitiable than that dogs should defile his grey hair and beard\rand all that men hide for shame." \r\rThe old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the heart\rof Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she bared her\rbosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. "Hector," she\rcried, weeping bitterly the while, "Hector, my son, spurn not this\rbreast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfort\rfrom my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the\rwall to protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should\rthe wretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall\rever weep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie,\rfor dogs will devour you at the ships of the Achaeans." \r\rThus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved\rnot the heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge Achilles\ras he drew nearer towards him. As serpent in its den upon the mountains,\rfull fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach of man- he is\rfilled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes writhing round\rhis den- even so Hector leaned his shield against a tower that jutted\rout from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted. \r\r"Alas," said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, "if I go\rwithin the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon\rme, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the city\ron that awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would\rnot listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so.\rNow that my folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men\rand Trojan women in the face, lest a worse man should say, \'Hector\rhas ruined us by his self-confidence.\' Surely it would be better for\rme to return after having fought Achilles and slain him, or to die\rgloriously here before the city. What, again, if were to lay down\rmy shield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight\rup to noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen,\rwho was the fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that\rAlexandrus brought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let\rthe Achaeans divide the half of everything that the city contains\ramong themselves? I might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their\rprinces, take a solemn oath that they would hide nothing, but would\rdivide into two shares all that is within the city- but why argue\rwith myself in this way? Were I to go up to him he would show me no\rkind of mercy; he would kill me then and there as easily as though\rI were a woman, when I had off my armour. There is no parleying with\rhim from some rock or oak tree as young men and maidens prattle with\rone another. Better fight him at once, and learn to which of us Jove\rwill vouchsafe victory." \r\rThus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it were\rMars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder he brandished\rhis terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamed around him\rlike flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fell upon Hector\ras he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he was but fled\rin dismay from before the gates, while Achilles darted after him at\rhis utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds, swoops\rdown upon some cowering dove- the dove flies before him but the falcon\rwith a shrill scream follows close after, resolved to have her- even\rso did Achilles make straight for Hector with all his might, while\rHector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take\rhim. \r\rOn they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the wall,\rpast the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild fig-tree,\rtill they came to two fair springs which feed the river Scamander.\rOne of these two springs is warm, and steam rises from it as smoke\rfrom a burning fire, but the other even in summer is as cold as hail\ror snow, or the ice that forms on water. Here, hard by the springs,\rare the goodly washing-troughs of stone, where in the time of peace\rbefore the coming of the Achaeans the wives and fair daughters of\rthe Trojans used to wash their clothes. Past these did they fly, the\rone in front and the other giving ha. behind him: good was the man\rthat fled, but better far was he that followed after, and swiftly\rindeed did they run, for the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice\ror bullock\'s hide, as it might be for a common foot-race, but they\rran for the life of Hector. As horses in a chariot race speed round\rthe turning-posts when they are running for some great prize- a tripod\ror woman- at the games in honour of some dead hero, so did these two\rrun full speed three times round the city of Priam. All the gods watched\rthem, and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.\r\r"Alas," said he, "my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being pursued\rround the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for Hector, who\rhas burned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honour, at one while\ron the of many-valleyed Ida, and again on the citadel of Troy; and\rnow I see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him round the city of\rPriam. What say you? Consider among yourselves and decide whether\rwe shall now save him or let him fall, valiant though he be, before\rAchilles, son of Peleus." \r\rThen Minerva said, "Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud\rand storm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doom has\rlong been decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we\rothers shall not be of a mind with you." \r\rAnd Jove answered, "My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not speak\rin full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do without let\ror hindrance as you are minded." \r\rThus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she darted\rfrom the topmost summits of Olympus. \r\rAchilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing a\rfawn which he has started from its covert on the mountains, and hunts\rthrough glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by crouching\runder cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her up\runtil he gets her- even so there was no escape for Hector from the\rfleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian\rgates and under the walls, that his people might help him by showering\rdown weapons from above, Achilles would gain on him and head him back\rtowards the plain, keeping himself always on the city side. As a man\rin a dream who fails to lay hands upon another whom he is pursuing-\rthe one cannot escape nor the other overtake- even so neither could\rAchilles come up with Hector, nor Hector break away from Achilles;\rnevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not the time\rcome when Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved\rhis running, was now no longer to stay by him. Achilles made signs\rto the Achaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to\raim a dart at Hector, lest another might win the glory of having hit\rhim and he might himself come in second. Then, at last, as they were\rnearing the fountains for the fourth time, the father of all balanced\rhis golden scales and placed a doom in each of them, one for Achilles\rand the other for Hector. As he held the scales by the middle, the\rdoom of Hector fell down deep into the house of Hades- and then Phoebus\rApollo left him. Thereon Minerva went close up to the son of Peleus\rand said, "Noble Achilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely\rtake back to the ships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector,\rfor all his lust of battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling\rbefore his father, aegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer.\rStay here and take breath, while I go up to him and persuade him to\rmake a stand and fight you." \r\rThus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still, leaning\ron his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left him and went\rafter Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. She came\rclose up to him and said, "Dear brother, I see you are hard pressed\rby Achilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city of Priam,\rlet us await his onset and stand on our defence." \r\rAnd Hector answered, "Deiphobus, you have always been dearest to me\rof all my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforth I\rshall rate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured outside\rthe wall for my sake when all the others remain inside."\r\rThen Minerva said, "Dear brother, my father and mother went down on\rtheir knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain inside,\rso great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an agony of\rgrief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a stand and\rfight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve, that we\rmay learn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off our spoils to\rthe ships, or whether he shall fall before you." \r\rThus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two were\rnow close to one another great Hector was first to speak. "I will-no\rlonger fly you, son of Peleus," said he, "as I have been doing hitherto.\rThree times have I fled round the mighty city of Priam, without daring\rto withstand you, but now, let me either slay or be slain, for I am\rin the mind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to one another\rby our gods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardians of all covenants;\rlet it be agreed between us that if Jove vouchsafes me the longer\rstay and I take your life, I am not to treat your dead body in any\runseemly fashion, but when I have stripped you of your armour, I am\rto give up your body to the Achaeans. And do you likewise."\r\rAchilles glared at him and answered, "Fool, prate not to me about\rcovenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves\rand lambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out\ran through. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and\rme, nor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall\rfall and glut grim Mars with his life\'s blood. Put forth all your\rstrength; you have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldier\rand man of war. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva will forthwith\rvanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full for the grief\ryou have caused me on account of my comrades whom you have killed\rin battle." \r\rHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it coming\rand avoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew over\rhis head and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it\rup and gave it back to Achilles without Hector\'s seeing her; Hector\rthereon said to the son of Peleus, "You have missed your aim, Achilles,\rpeer of the gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you the hour of\rmy doom, though you made sure that he had done so. You were a false-tongued\rliar when you deemed that I should forget my valour and quail before\ryou. You shall not drive spear into the back of a runaway- drive it,\rshould heaven so grant you power, drive it into me as I make straight\rtowards you; and now for your own part avoid my spear if you can-\rwould that you might receive the whole of it into your body; if you\rwere once dead the Trojans would find the war an easier matter, for\rit is you who have harmed them most." \r\rHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true for\rhe hit the middle of Achilles\' shield, but the spear rebounded from\rit, and did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw that the weapon\rhad sped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had\rno second spear. With a loud cry he called Diphobus and asked him\rfor one, but there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to himself,\r"Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. I deemed that\rthe hero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within the wall, and\rMinerva has inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly near at\rhand and there is no way out of it- for so Jove and his son Apollo\rthe far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever\rready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die\ringloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great\rthing that shall be told among men hereafter." \r\rAs he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong by\rhis side, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles like\ra soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb\ror timid hare- even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon\rAchilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrous\rshield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with four\rlayers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. The thick tresses of gold\rwi which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as the\revening star that shines brighter than all others through the stillness\rof night, even such was the gleam of the spear which Achilles poised\rin his right hand, fraught with the death of noble Hector. He eyed\rhis fair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound it,\rbut all was protected by the goodly armour of which Hector had spoiled\rPatroclus after he had slain him, save only the throat where the collar-bones\rdivide the neck from the shoulders, and this is a most deadly place:\rhere then did Achilles strike him as he was coming on towards him,\rand the point of his spear went right through the fleshy part of the\rneck, but it did not sever his windpipe so that he could still speak.\rHector fell headlong, and Achilles vaunted over him saying, "Hector,\ryou deemed that you should come off scatheless when you were spoiling\rPatroclus, and recked not of myself who was not with him. Fool that\ryou were: for I, his comrade, mightier far than he, was still left\rbehind him at the ships, and now I have laid you low. The Achaeans\rshall give him all due funeral rites, while dogs and vultures shall\rwork their will upon yourself." \r\rThen Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, "I pray you by your\rlife and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me at the\rships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and bronze\rwhich my father and mother will offer you, and send my body home,\rthat the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when\rI am dead." \r\rAchilles glared at him and answered, "Dog, talk not to me neither\rof knees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able\rto cut your flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill have done\rme, as I am that nothing shall save you from the dogs- it shall not\rbe, though they bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for\rme on the spot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son\rof Dardanus should bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so\ryour mother shall never lay you out and make lament over the son she\rbore, but dogs and vultures shall eat you utterly up." \r\rHector with his dying breath then said, "I know you what you are,\rand was sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard as\riron; look to it that I bring not heaven\'s anger upon you on the day\rwhen Paris and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you\rat the Scaean gates." \r\rWhen he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon his\rsoul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamenting\rits sad fate that it should en\' youth and strength no longer. But\rAchilles said, speaking to the dead body, "Die; for my part I will\raccept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send\rit." \r\rAs he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one side;\rthen he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector\'s shoulders\rwhile the other Achaeans came running up to view his wondrous strength\rand beauty; and no one came near him without giving him a fresh wound.\rThen would one turn to his neighbour and say, "It is easier to handle\rHector now than when he was flinging fire on to our ships" and as\rhe spoke he would thrust his spear into him anew. \r\rWhen Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood among\rthe Argives and said, "My friends, princes and counsellors of the\rArgives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, who\rhas done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether\rwe should not attack the city in force, and discover in what mind\rthe Trojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will desert\rtheir city now that Hector has fallen, or will still hold out even\rthough he is no longer living. But why argue with myself in this way,\rwhile Patroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, and unmourned-\rhe Whom I can never forget so long as I am alive and my strength fails\rnot? Though men forget their dead when once they are within the house\rof Hades, yet not even there will I forget the comrade whom I have\rlost. Now, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise the song of victory\rand go back to the ships taking this man along with us; for we have\rachieved a mighty triumph and have slain noble Hector to whom the\rTrojans prayed throughout their city as though he were a god."\r\rOn this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced the\rsinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passed\rthongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the\rbody fast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground.\rThen when he had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself\rmounted, he lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth.\rThe dust rose from Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark\rhair flew all abroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on\rearth, for Jove had now delivered him into the hands of his foes to\rdo him outrage in his own land. \r\rThus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His mother\rtore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as she\rlooked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and throughout\rthe city the people fell to weeping and wailing. It was as though\rthe whole of frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire. Hardly could\rthe people hold Priam back in his hot haste to rush without the gates\rof the city. He grovelled in the mire and besought them, calling each\rone of them by his name. "Let be, my friends," he cried, "and for\rall your sorrow, suffer me to go single-handed to the ships of the\rAchaeans. Let me beseech this cruel and terrible man, if maybe he\rwill respect the feeling of his fellow-men, and have compassion on\rmy old age. His own father is even such another as myself- Peleus,\rwho bred him and reared him to- be the bane of us Trojans, and of\rmyself more than of all others. Many a son of mine has he slain in\rthe flower of his youth, and yet, grieve for these as I may, I do\rso for one- Hector- more than for them all, and the bitterness of\rmy sorrow will bring me down to the house of Hades. Would that he\rhad died in my arms, for so both his ill-starred mother who bore him,\rand myself, should have had the comfort of weeping and mourning over\rhim." \r\rThus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city\rjoined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among\rthe Trojans. "Alas, my son," she cried, "what have I left to live\rfor now that you are no more? Night and day did I glory in. you throughout\rthe city, for you were a tower of strength to all in Troy, and both\rmen and women alike hailed you as a god. So long as you lived you\rwere their pride, but now death and destruction have fallen upon you."\r\rHector\'s wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to tell\rher that her husband had remained without the gates. She was at her\rloom in an inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web, and\rembroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set a large\rtripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hector when\rhe came out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now beyond\rthe reach of baths, and that Minerva had laid him low by the hands\rof Achilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, and trembled\rin every limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again she spoke\rto her waiting-women. "Two of you," she said, "come with me that I\rmay learn what it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my husband\'s\rhonoured mother; my own heart beats as though it would come into my\rmouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great misfortune for Priam\'s\rchildren must be at hand. May I never live to hear it, but I greatly\rfear that Achilles has cut off the retreat of brave Hector and has\rchased him on to the plain where he was singlehanded; I fear he may\rhave put an end to the reckless daring which possessed my husband,\rwho would never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on\rfar in front, foremost of them all in valour." \r\rHer heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like\ra maniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached\rthe battlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon\rthe wall, and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city- the\rhorses dragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the\rships of the Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness\rof night and she fell fainting backwards. She tore the tiring from\rher head and flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaited\rband, and the veil which golden Venus had given her on the day when\rHector took her with him from the house of Eetion, after having given\rcountless gifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband\'s sisters and\rthe wives of his brothers crowded round her and supported her, for\rshe was fain to die in her distraction; when she again presently breathed\rand came to herself, she sobbed and made lament among the Trojans\rsaying, \'Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common\rlot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes\runder the wooded mountain of Placus in the house of Eetion who brought\rme up when I was a child- ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter-\rwould that he had never begotten me. You are now going into the house\rof Hades under the secret places of the earth, and you leave me a\rsorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whom you and I are the\runhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now that you are gone, O\rHector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you. Even though he\rescape the horrors of this woful war with the Achaeans, yet shall\rhis life henceforth be one of labour and sorrow, for others will seize\rhis lands. The day that robs a child of his parents severs him from\rhis own kind; his head is bowed, his cheeks are wet with tears, and\rhe will go about destitute among the friends of his father, plucking\rone by the cloak and another by the shirt. Some one or other of these\rmay so far pity him as to hold the cup for a moment towards him and\rlet him moisten his lips, but he must not drink enough to wet the\rroof of his mouth; then one whose parents are alive will drive him\rfrom the table with blows and angry words. \'Out with you,\' he will\rsay, \'you have no father here,\' and the child will go crying back\rto his widowed mother- he, Astyanax, who erewhile would sit upon his\rfather\'s knees, and have none but the daintiest and choicest morsels\rset before him. When he had played till he was tired and went to sleep,\rhe would lie in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, on a soft couch,\rknowing neither want nor care, whereas now that he has lost his father\rhis lot will be full of hardship- he, whom the Trojans name Astyanax,\rbecause you, O Hector, were the only defence of their gates and battlements.\rThe wriggling writhing worms will now eat you at the ships, far from\ryour parents, when the dogs have glutted themselves upon you. You\rwill lie naked, although in your house you have fine and goodly raiment\rmade by hands of women. This will I now burn; it is of no use to you,\rfor you can never again wear it, and thus you will have respect shown\ryou by the Trojans both men and women." \r\rIn such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women joined\rin her lament. \r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XXIII\r\rThus did they make their moan throughout the city, while the Achaeans\rwhen they reached the Hellespont went back every man to his own ship.\rBut Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to his brave\rcomrades saying, "Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends,\rnot yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with horse and chariot draw\rnear to the body and mourn Patroclus, in due honour to the dead. When\rwe have had full comfort of lamentation we will unyoke our horses\rand take supper all of us here." \r\rOn this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them\rin their lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing\rround the body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning.\rThe sands of the seashore and the men\'s armour were wet with their\rweeping, so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost. Chief\rin all their mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid his bloodstained\rhand on the breast of his friend. "Fare well," he cried, "Patroclus,\reven in the house of Hades. I will now do all that I erewhile promised\ryou; I will drag Hector hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve\rnoble sons of Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge\ryou." \r\rAs he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely, laying\rit at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus. The others\rthen put off every man his armour, took the horses from their chariots,\rand seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of the fleet\rdescendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with an abundant funeral\rbanquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did\rthey butcher and cut up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed,\rdid they singe and set to roast in the flames of Vulcan; and rivulets\rof blood flowed all round the place where the body was lying.\r\rThen the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus to Agamemnon,\rbut hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so wroth was\rhe for the death of his comrade. As soon as they reached Agamemnon\'s\rtent they told the serving-men to set a large tripod over the fire\rin case they might persuade the son of Peleus \'to wash the clotted\rgore from this body, but he denied them sternly, and swore it with\ra solemn oath, saying, "Nay, by King Jove, first and mightiest of\rall gods, it is not meet that water should touch my body, till I have\rlaid Patroclus on the flames, have built him a barrow, and shaved\rmy head- for so long as I live no such second sorrow shall ever draw\rnigh me. Now, therefore, let us do all that this sad festival demands,\rbut at break of day, King Agamemnon, bid your men bring wood, and\rprovide all else that the dead may duly take into the realm of darkness;\rthe fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the sooner, and the\rpeople shall turn again to their own labours." \r\rThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made haste\rto prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so\rthat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had had enough to eat\rand drink, the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but\rthe son of Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of\rthe sounding sea, in an open place where the waves came surging in\rone after another. Here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and\reased the burden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasing\rHector round windy Ilius. Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drew\rnear him, like what he had been in stature, voice, and the light of\rhis beaming eyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirit\rhovered over his head and said- \r\r"You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living,\rbut now that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with all\rspeed that I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadows\rof men that can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will\rnot yet suffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and I wander\rall desolate by the wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now\ryour hand I pray you, for when you have once given me my dues of fire,\rnever shall I again come forth out of the house of Hades. Nevermore\rshall we sit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; the cruel\rfate which was my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around me-\rnay, you too Achilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the\rwall of the noble Trojans. \r\r"One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not my\rbones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even as we\rwere brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius brought\rme to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed\rthe son of Amphidamas- not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel\rover the dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreated\rme kindly, and named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones\rlie in but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you\rby your mother." \r\rAnd Achilles answered, "Why, true heart, are you come hither to lay\rthese charges upon me? will of my own self do all as you have bidden\rme. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around one\ranother, and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows."\r\rHe opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped\rhim in them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a vapour,\rgibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his feet,\rsmote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, "Of a truth even\rin the house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that have no life\rin them; all night long the sad spirit of Patroclus has hovered over\rhead making piteous moan, telling me what I am to do for him, and\rlooking wondrously like himself." \r\rThus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning\rabout the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then King\rAgamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring\rwood, and Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them.\rThey went out with woodmen\'s axes and strong ropes in their hands,\rand before them went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go,\rby straight ways and crooked, and when they reached the heights of\rmany-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to the roots of many a tall\rbranching oak that came thundering down as they felled it. They split\rthe trees and bound them behind the mules, which then wended their\rway as they best could through the thick brushwood on to the plain.\rAll who had been cutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones squire to\rIdomeneus had bidden them, and they threw them down in a line upon\rthe seashore at the place where Achilles would make a mighty monument\rfor Patroclus and for himself. \r\rWhen they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole\rground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achilles ordered\rhis brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke each man\rhis horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour and mounted\reach his chariot- they and their charioteers with them. The chariots\rwent before, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their\rtens of thousands after. In the midst of them his comrades bore Patroclus\rand covered him with the locks of their hair which they cut off and\rthrew upon his body. Last came Achilles with his head bowed for sorrow,\rso noble a comrade was he taking to the house of Hades. \r\rWhen they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they laid\rthe body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethought him of\ranother matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off the\ryellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. He looked\rall sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, "Spercheius, in vain\rdid my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home to my loved\rnative land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb;\rfifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at your springs, where\ris your grove and your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings. Thus did\rmy father vow, but you have not fulfilled his prayer; now, therefore,\rthat I shall see my home no more, I give this lock as a keepsake to\rthe hero Patroclus." \r\rAs he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, and\rall who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sun\rwould have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presently\rsaid to Agamemnon, "Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the people\rwill give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from mourning;\rbid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting their dinners:\rwe, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what is wanted here,\rand let the other princes also stay by me." \r\rWhen King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their ships,\rbut those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built a pyre\ra hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all sorrowfully\rupon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep and oxen\rbefore the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them and wrapped\rthe body therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed carcases all\rround it. Against the bier he leaned two-handled jars of honey and\runguents; four proud horses did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning\rthe while he did so. The dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them\rdid Achilles slay and threw upon the pyre; he also put twelve brave\rsons of noble Trojans to the sword and laid them with the rest, for\rhe was full of bitterness and fury. Then he committed all to the resistless\rand devouring might of the fire; he groaned aloud and callid on his\rdead comrade by name. "Fare well," he cried, "Patroclus, even in the\rhouse of Hades; I am now doing all that I have promised you. Twelve\rbrave sons of noble Trojans shall the flames consume along with yourself,\rbut dogs, not fire, shall devour the flesh of Hector son of Priam."\r\rThus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector,\rfor Jove\'s daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, and anointed\rhim with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be torn when\rAchilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover sent a dark\rcloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the whole place where\rHector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch his body.\r\rNow the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles therefore\rbethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed to the two\rwinds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. He made them\rmany drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them to come\rand help him that the wood might make haste to kindle and the dead\rbodies be consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying and started off to\rfetch the winds. They were holding high feast in the house of boisterous\rZephyrus when Iris came running up to the stone threshold of the house\rand stood there, but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came\rtowards her and each of them called her to him, but Iris would not\rsit down. "I cannot stay," she said, "I must go back to the streams\rof Oceanus and the land of the Ethiopians who are offering hecatombs\rto the immortals, and I would have my share; but Achilles prays that\rBoreas and shrill Zephyrus will come to him, and he vows them goodly\rofferings; he would have you blow upon the pyre of Patroclus for whom\rall the Achaeans are lamenting." \r\rWith this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rent\rthe air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on until\rthey came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but when\rthey reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames roared\runder the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow hard\rand beat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his\rdouble cup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon\rthe spirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the ground until\rthe earth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning the\rbones of his bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his\rparents, even so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of his\rcomrade, pacing round the bier with piteous groaning and lamentation.\r\rAt length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light which\rsaffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the flames\rfell and the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond the\rThracian sea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. The son\rof Peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome with\rtoil, till he fell into a sweet slumber. Presently they who were about\rthe son of Atreus drew near in a body, and roused him with the noise\rand tramp of their coming. He sat upright and said, "Son of Atreus,\rand all other princes of the Achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere\rupon the fire and quench it; let us then gather the bones of Patroclus\rson of Menoetius, singling them out with care; they are easily found,\rfor they lie in the middle of the pyre, while all else, both men and\rhorses, has been thrown in a heap and burned at the outer edge. We\rwill lay the bones in a golden urn, in two layers of fat, against\rthe time when I shall myself go down into the house of Hades. As for\rthe barrow, labour not to raise a great one now, but such as is reasonable.\rAfterwards, let those Achaeans who may be left at the ships when I\ram gone, build it both broad and high." \r\rThus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. First\rthey poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the\rfire. With many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their\rloved comrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of fat:\rthey then covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside the\rtent. They marked off the circle where the barrow should be, made\ra foundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up the earth.\rWhen they had thus raised a mound they were going away, but Achilles\rstayed the people and made them sit in assembly. He brought prizes\rfrom the ships-cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen, women\rwith fair girdles, and swart iron. \r\rThe first prize he offered was for the chariot races- a woman skilled\rin all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had ears for\rhandles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the man\rwho came in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare, unbroken,\rand in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly cauldron that\rhad never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as when it left\rthe maker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prize was two\rtalents of gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by\rsmoke. Then he stood up and spoke among the Argives saying-\r\r"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that\rlie waiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time I\rshould carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you know\rhow far my steeds excel all others- for they are immortal; Neptune\rgave them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself;\rbut I shall hold aloof, I and my steeds that have lost their brave\rand kind driver, who many a time has washed them in clear water and\ranointed their manes with oil. See how they stand weeping here, with\rtheir manes trailing on the ground in the extremity of their sorrow.\rBut do you others set yourselves in order throughout the host, whosoever\rhas confidence in his horses and in the strength of his chariot."\r\rThus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred\rthemselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king of men, son\rof Admetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mighty\rDiomed son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken\rfrom Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him, yellow-haired\rMenelaus son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses, Agamemnon\'s\rmare Aethe, and his own horse Podargus. The mare had been given to\rAgamemnon by echepolus son of Anchises, that he might not have to\rfollow him to Ilius, but might stay at home and take his ease; for\rJove had endowed him with great wealth and he lived in spacious Sicyon.\rThis mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaus put under the yoke.\r\rFourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus, made\rready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father came up\rto him to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in but\rlittle need. "Antilochus," said Nestor, "you are young, but Jove and\rNeptune have loved you well, and have made you an excellent horseman.\rI need not therefore say much by way of instruction. You are skilful\rat wheeling your horses round the post, but the horses themselves\rare very slow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your chances.\rThe other drivers know less than you do, but their horses are fleeter;\rtherefore, my dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice whereby\ryou may insure that the prize shall not slip through your fingers.\rThe woodman does more by skill than by brute force; by skill the pilot\rguides his storm-tossed barque over the sea, and so by skill one driver\rcan beat another. If a man go wide in rounding this way and that,\rwhereas a man who knows what he is doing may have worse horses, but\rhe will keep them well in hand when he sees the doubling-post; he\rknows the precise moment at which to pull the rein, and keeps his\reye well on the man in front of him. I will give you this certain\rtoken which cannot escape your notice. There is a stump of a dead\rtree-oak or pine as it may be- some six feet above the ground, and\rnot yet rotted away by rain; it stands at the fork of the road; it\rhas two white stones set one on each side, and there is a clear course\rall round it. It may have been a monument to some one long since dead,\ror it may have been used as a doubling-post in days gone by; now,\rhowever, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the mark round which\rthe chariots shall turn; hug it as close as you can, but as you stand\rin your chariot lean over a little to the left; urge on your right-hand\rhorse with voice and lash, and give him a loose rein, but let the\rleft-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave of your wheel shall\ralmost graze the post; but mind the stone, or you will wound your\rhorses and break your chariot in pieces, which would be sport for\rothers but confusion for yourself. Therefore, my dear son, mind well\rwhat you are about, for if you can be first to round the post there\ris no chance of any one giving you the goby later, not even though\ryou had Adrestus\'s horse Arion behind you horse which is of divine\rrace- or those of Laomedon, which are the noblest in this country."\r\rWhen Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in\rhis place, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They\rthen all mounted their chariots and cast lots.- Achilles shook the\rhelmet, and the lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first; next\rcame that of King Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son of\rAtreus and of Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomed son\rof Tydeus, who was the best man of them all. They took their places\rin line; Achilles showed them the doubling-post round which they were\rto turn, some way off upon the plain; here he stationed his father\'s\rfollower Phoenix as umpire, to note the running, and report truly.\r\rAt the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck them\rwith the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. They flew\rfull speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose from\runder them as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were all\rflying in the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the\rground, and then again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood\rerect, and their hearts beat fast and furious in their lust of victory.\rEach kept calling on his horses, and the horses scoured the plain\ramid the clouds of dust that they raised. \r\rIt was when they were doing the last part of the course on their way\rback towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and\rit was seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheres\rnow took the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallions\rof Diomed. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus\'s chariot, and\rhe could feel their warm breath on his back and on his broad shoulders,\rfor their heads were close to him as they flew over the course. Diomed\rwould have now passed him, or there would have been a dead heat, but\rPhoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his whip. Tears of anger\rfell from his eyes as he saw the mares going on faster than ever,\rwhile his own horses lost ground through his having no whip. Minerva\rsaw the trick which Apollo had played the son of Tydeus, so she brought\rhim his whip and put spirit into his horses; moreover she went after\rthe son of Admetus in a rage and broke his yoke for him; the mares\rwent one to one side the course, and the other to the other, and the\rpole was broken against the ground. Eumelus was thrown from his chariot\rclose to the wheel; his elbows, mouth, and nostrils were all torn,\rand his forehead was bruised above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with\rtears and he could find no utterance. But the son of Tydeus turned\rhis horses aside and shot far ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength\rinto them and covered Diomed himself with glory. \r\rMenelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus called\rto his father\'s horses. "On with you both," he cried, "and do your\rvery utmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of\rTydeus, for Minerva has put running into them, and has covered Diomed\rwith glory; but you must overtake the horses of the son of Atreus\rand not be left behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will taunt you. Why,\rmy good fellows, are you lagging? I tell you, and it shall surely\rbe- Nestor will keep neither of you, but will put both of you to the\rsword, if we win any the worse a prize through your carelessness,\rfly after them at your utmost speed; I will hit on a plan for passing\rthem in a narrow part of the way, and it shall not fail me."\r\rThey feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space went\rquicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the road had\rsunk. The ground was broken, for the winter\'s rain had gathered and\rhad worn the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus was\rmaking towards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but\rAntilochus turned his horses out of the way, and followed him a little\ron one side. The son of Atreus was afraid and shouted out, "Antilochus,\ryou are driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the road is too narrow\rhere, it will be wider soon, and you can pass me then; if you foul\rmy chariot you may bring both of us to a mischief." \r\rBut Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had\rnot heard him. They went side by side for about as far as a young\rman can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his strength,\rand then Menelaus\'s mares drew behind, for he left off driving for\rfear the horses should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus,\rwhile pressing on in quest of victory, they might both come headlong\rto the ground. Menelaus then upbraided Antilochus and said, "There\ris no greater trickster living than you are; go, and bad luck go with\ryou; the Achaeans say not well that you have understanding, and come\rwhat may you shall not bear away the prize without sworn protest on\rmy part." \r\rThen he called on his horses and said to them, "Keep your pace, and\rslacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner than\ryours, for they are neither of them young." \r\rThe horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so\rthat they were soon nearly up with the others. \r\rMeanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses\rwent, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust. Idomeneus\rcaptain of the Cretans was first to make out the running, for he was\rnot in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the most commanding part\rof the ground. The driver was a long way off, but Idomeneus could\rhear him shouting, and could see the foremost horse quite plainly-\ra chestnut with a round white star, like the moon, on its forehead.\rHe stood up and said among the Argives, "My friends, princes and counsellors\rof the Argives, can you see the running as well as I can? There seems\rto be another pair in front now, and another driver; those that led\roff at the start must have been disabled out on the plain. I saw them\rat first making their way round the doubling-post, but now, though\rI search the plain of Troy, I cannot find them. Perhaps the reins\rfell from the driver\'s hand so that he lost command of his horses\rat the doubling-post, and could not turn it. I suppose he must have\rbeen thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his mares have\rleft the course and gone off wildly in a panic. Come up and see for\ryourselves, I cannot make out for certain, but the driver seems an\rAetolian by descent, ruler over the Argives, brave Diomed the son\rof Tydeus." \r\rAjax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, "Idomeneus, why\rshould you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when the mares\rare still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the youngest,\rnor your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always laying down\rthe law. You have no right to do so, for there are better men here\rthan you are. Eumelus\'s horses are in front now, as they always have\rbeen, and he is on the chariot holding the reins." \r\rThe captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, "Ajax you are\ran excellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in\rmuch else as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a\rtripod or cauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose\rhorses are first. You will then know to your cost." \r\rAjax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there would\rhave been yet further brawling between them, had not Achilles risen\rin his place and said, "Cease your railing Ajax and Idomeneus; it\ris not you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do the like:\rsit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding towards\rthe winning-post and will be bere directly. You will then both of\ryou know whose horses are first, and whose come after." \r\rAs he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his\rwhip lustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they\rflew over the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver,\rand the chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet\rhorses. There was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and\rthe horses came flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them\rin the middle of the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chests\rfell in streams on to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from his goodly\rchariot, and leaned his whip against his horses\' yoke; brave Sthenelus\rnow lost no time, but at once brought on the prize, and gave the woman\rand the ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away. Then he\runyoked the horses. \r\rNext after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had passed\rMenelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; but even\rso Menelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse\rthat draws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of a horse\'s\rtail touch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much space between\rwheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelaus was no further\rthan this behind Antilochus, though at first he had been a full disc\'s\rthrow behind him. He had soon caught him up again, for Agamemnon\'s\rmare Aethe kept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course\rhad been longer he would have passed him, and there would not even\rhave been a dead heat. Idomeneus\'s brave squire Meriones was about\ra spear\'s cast behind Menelaus. His horses were slowest of all, and\rhe was the worst driver. Last of them all came the son of Admetus,\rdragging his chariot and driving his horses on in front. When Achilles\rsaw him he was sorry, and stood up among the Argives saying, "The\rbest man is coming in last. Let us give him a prize for it is reasonable.\rHe shall have the second, but the first must go to the son of Tydeus."\r\rThus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying,\rand were for doing as he had said, but Nestor\'s son Antilochus stood\rup and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. "Achilles," said\rhe, "I shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob\rme of my prize, because you think Eumelus\'s chariot and horses were\rthrown out, and himself too, good man that he is. He should have prayed\rduly to the immortals; he would not have come in fast if he had done\rso. If you are sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in\ryour tents, with bronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something\rfrom this store if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you,\rand give him a better prize even than that which you have now offered;\rbut I will not give up the mare, and he that will fight me for her,\rlet him come on." \r\rAchilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus,\rwho was one of his dearest comrades. So he said- \r\r"Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I will\rgive him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round\rit which I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him."\r\rHe bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent,\rand he did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who received\rit gladly. \r\rBut Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. An\rattendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keep\rsilence: the hero then addressed them. "Antilochus," said he, "what\ris this from you who have been so far blameless? You have made me\rcut a poor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front\rof them, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, O princes\rand counsellors of the Argives, judge between us and show no favour,\rlest one of the Achaeans say, \'Menelaus has got the mare through lying\rand corruption; his horses were far inferior to Antilochus\'s, but\rhe has greater weight and influence.\' Nay, I will determine the matter\rmyself, and no man will blame me, for I shall do what is just. Come\rhere, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is, whip in hand before\ryour chariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear by\rearth-encircling Neptune that you did not purposely and guilefully\rget in the way of my horses." \r\rAnd Antilochus answered, "Forgive me; I am much younger, King Menelaus,\rthan you are; you stand higher than I do and are the better man of\rthe two; you know how easily young men are betrayed into indiscretion;\rtheir tempers are more hasty and they have less judgement; make due\rallowances therefore, and bear with me; I will of my own accord give\rup the mare that I have won, and if you claim any further chattel\rfrom my own possessions, I would rather yield it to you, at once,\rthan fall from your good graces henceforth, and do wrong in the sight\rof heaven." \r\rThe son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to Menelaus,\rwhose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a field of ripening\rcorn, and the lands are bristling with the harvest- even so, O Menelaus,\rwas your heart made glad within you. He turned to Antilochus and said,\r"Now, Antilochus, angry though I have been, I can give way to you\rof my own free will; you have never been headstrong nor ill-disposed\rhitherto, but this time your youth has got the better of your judgement;\rbe careful how you outwit your betters in future; no one else could\rhave brought me round so easily, but your good father, your brother,\rand yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on my behalf; I\rtherefore yield to your entreaty, and will give up the mare to you,\rmine though it indeed be; the people will thus see that I am neither\rharsh nor vindictive." \r\rWith this he gave the mare over to Antilochus\'s comrade Noemon, and\rthen took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth, carried\roff the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the two-handled\rurn, being unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going up to him\ramong the assembled Argives and saying, "Take this, my good old friend,\ras an heirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroclus- for you shall\rsee him no more among the Argives. I give you this prize though you\rcannot win one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight, and cannot\renter for the javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of age has\rbeen laid heavily upon you." \r\rSo saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly and\ranswered, "My son, all that you have said is true; there is no strength\rnow in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands from either\rshoulder. Would that I were still young and strong as when the Epeans\rwere burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sons offered prizes\rin his honour. There was then none that could vie with me neither\rof the Epeans nor the Pylians themselves nor the Aetolians. In boxing\rI overcame Clytomedes son of Enops, and in wrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron\rwho had come forward against me. Iphiclus was a good runner, but I\rbeat him, and threw farther with my spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus.\rIn chariot-racing alone did the two sons of Actor surpass me by crowding\rtheir horses in front of me, for they were angry at the way victory\rhad gone, and at the greater part of the prizes remaining in the place\rin which they had been offered. They were twins, and the one kept\ron holding the reins, and holding the reins, while the other plied\rthe whip. Such was I then, but now I must leave these matters to younger\rmen; I must bow before the weight of years, but in those days I was\reminent among heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests\rin honour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart\rrejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwill\rtowards you, and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For all\rwhich may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance."\r\rThereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks\rof Nestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, and presently\roffered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He brought\rout a strong mule, and made it fast in the middle of the crowd- a\rshe-mule never yet broken, but six years old- when it is hardest of\rall to break them: this was for the victor, and for the vanquished\rhe offered a double cup. Then he stood up and said among the Argives,\r"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, I invite our two champion\rboxers to lay about them lustily and compete for these prizes. He\rto whom Apollo vouchsafes the greater endurance, and whom the Achaeans\racknowledge as victor, shall take the mule back with him to his own\rtent, while he that is vanquished shall have the double cup."\r\rAs he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and great stature,\ra skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his hand on the mule\rand said, "Let the man who is to have the cup come hither, for none\rbut myself will take the mule. I am the best boxer of all here present,\rand none can beat me. Is it not enough that I should fall short of\ryou in actual fighting? Still, no man can be good at everything. I\rtell you plainly, and it shall come true; if any man will box with\rme I will bruise his body and break his bones; therefore let his friends\rstay here in a body and be at hand to take him away when I have done\rwith him." \r\rThey all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son of Mecisteus,\rwho was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebes after the fall\rof Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all the people of Cadmus.\rThe son of Tydeus was Euryalus\'s second, cheering him on and hoping\rheartily that he would win. First he put a waistband round him and\rthen he gave him some well-cut thongs of ox-hide; the two men being\rnow girt went into the middle of the ring, and immediately fell to;\rheavily indeed did they punish one another and lay about them with\rtheir brawny fists. One could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws,\rand they sweated from every pore of their skin. Presently Epeus came\ron and gave Euryalus a blow on the jaw as he was looking round; Euryalus\rcould not keep his legs; they gave way under him in a moment and he\rsprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the air near some shore\rthat is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when Boreas furs the top of the\rwaves, and then falls back into deep water. But noble Epeus caught\rhold of him and raised him up; his comrades also came round him and\rled him from the ring, unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one\rside, and spitting great clots of gore. They set him down in a swoon\rand then went to fetch the double cup. \r\rThe son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest\rand showed them to the Argives. These were for the painful art of\rwrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod ready for setting\rupon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among themselves at twelve\roxen. For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner of\rarts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among the\rArgives, "Stand forward, you who will essay this contest."\r\rForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty Ulysses,\rfull of wiles rose also. The two girded themselves and went into the\rmiddle of the ring. They gripped each other in their strong hands\rlike the rafters which some master-builder frames for the roof of\ra high house to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked as they\rtugged at one another with their mighty arms- and sweat rained from\rthem in torrents. Many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides and\rshoulders, but they kept on striving with might and main for victory\rand to win the tripod. Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him;\rUlysses was too strong for him; but when the Achaeans began to tire\rof watching them, Ajax said to ulysses, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,\ryou shall either lift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it between\rus." \r\rHe lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did not forget\rhis cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee, so that\rhe could not keep his feet, but fell on his back with Ulysses lying\rupon his chest, and all who saw it marvelled. Then Ulysses in turn\rlifted Ajax and stirred him a little from the ground but could not\rlift him right off it, his knee sank under him, and the two fell side\rby side on the ground and were all begrimed with dust. They now sprang\rtowards one another and were for wrestling yet a third time, but Achilles\rrose and stayed them. "Put not each other further," said he, "to such\rcruel suffering; the victory is with both alike, take each of you\ran equal prize, and let the other Achaeans now compete."\r\rThus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on their\rshirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.\r\rThe son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running- a mixing-bowl\rbeautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold six measures, and\rfar exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty; it was the\rwork of cunning artificers in Sidon, and had been brought into port\rby Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a present of it to\rThoas. Eueneus son of jason had given it to Patroclus in ransom of\rPriam\'s son Lycaon, and Achilles now offered it as a prize in honour\rof his comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. For the second\rprize he offered a large ox, well fattened, while for the last there\rwas to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and said among the Argives,\r"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest." \r\rForthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, and\rNestor\'s son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of\rhis time. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal.\rThe course was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son\rof Oileus took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him\ras the shuttle is to a woman\'s bosom when she throws the woof across\rthe warp and holds it close up to her; even so close behind him was\rUlysses- treading in his footprints before the dust could settle there,\rand Ajax could feel his breath on the back of his head as he ran swiftly\ron. The Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him straining his\rutmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they were now\rnearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly to Minerva.\r"Hear me," he cried, "and help my feet, O goddess." Thus did he pray,\rand Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his hands and his feet\rfeel light, and when the runners were at the point of pouncing upon\rthe prize, Ajax, through Minerva\'s spite slipped upon some offal that\rwas lying there from the cattle which Achilles had slaughtered in\rhonour of Patroclus, and his mouth and nostrils were all filled with\rcow dung. Ulysses therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got\rbefore Ajax and came in first. But Ajax took the ox and stood with\rhis hand on one of its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth.\rThen he said to the Argives, "Alas, the goddess has spoiled my running;\rshe watches over Ulysses and stands by him as though she were his\rown mother." Thus did he speak and they all of them laughed heartily.\r\rAntilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to the\rbystanders, "You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown\rtheir respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and\ras for Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale\rin spite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against\rhim save only Achilles." \r\rHe said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and Achilles\ranswered, "Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to no purpose;\rI shall give you an additional half talent of gold." He then gave\rthe half talent to Antilochus, who received it gladly. \r\rThen the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield that\rhad been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus.\rHe stood up and said among the Argives, "We bid two champions put\ron their armour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another\rin the presence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound\rthe flesh of the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to\rhim will I give this goodly Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which\rI took from Asteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership,\rand I will give each of them a hearty meal in my own tent."\r\rForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty Diomed\rson of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on his own side\rof the ring, they both went into the middle eager to engage, and with\rfire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelled as they beheld\rthem, and when the two were now close up with one another, thrice\rdid they spring forward and thrice try to strike each other in close\rcombat. Ajax pierced Diomed\'s round shield, but did not draw blood,\rfor the cuirass beneath the shield protected him; thereon the son\rof Tydeus from over his huge shield kept aiming continually at Ajax\'s\rneck with the point of his spear, and the Achaeans alarmed for his\rsafety bade them leave off fighting and divide the prize between them.\rAchilles then gave the great sword to the son of Tydeus, with its\rscabbard, and the leathern belt with which to hang it. \r\rAchilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion had\rerewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and carried\rit off in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and said\ramong the Argives, "Stand forward, you who would essay this contest.\rHe who wins it will have a store of iron that will last him five years\ras they go rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town\rhis shepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron,\rfor he will have a stock of it on his own premises." \r\rThen uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax\rson of Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the other\rand Epeus took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which\rset all the Achaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race\rof Mars. Ajax son of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond\rany mark that had been made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the\rquoit he hurled it as though it had been a stockman\'s stick which\rhe sends flying about among his cattle when he is driving them, so\rfar did his throw out-distance those of the others. All who saw it\rroared applause, and his comrades carried the prize for him and set\rit on board his ship. \r\rAchilles next offered a prize of iron for archery- ten double-edged\raxes and ten with single eddies: he set up a ship\'s mast, some way\roff upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to it by\rthe foot; this was what they were to aim at. "Whoever," he said, "can\rhit the pigeon shall have all the axes and take them away with him;\rhe who hits the string without hitting the bird will have taken a\rworse aim and shall have the single-edged axes." \r\rThen uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of Idomeneus\rrose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot of Teucer\rfell first. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but he did not promise\rhecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, and missed his bird,\rfor Apollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with which the bird\rwas tied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean through so\rthat it hung down towards the ground, while the bird flew up into\rthe sky, and the Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, who had his\rarrow ready while Teucer was aiming, snatched the bow out of his hand,\rand at once promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling\rlambs to Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under\rthe clouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as she was circling\rupwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself in\rthe ground at Meriones\' feet, but the bird perched on the ship\'s mast\rhanging her head and with all her feathers drooping; the life went\rout of her, and she fell heavily from the mast. Meriones, therefore,\rtook all ten double-edged axes, while Teucer bore off the single-edged\rones to his ships. \r\rThen the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had\rnever been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a\rpattern of flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up- to\rwit the son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart\rsquire of Idomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, "Son of Atreus, we\rknow how far you excel all others both in power and in throwing the\rjavelin; take the cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it\rso please you, let us give the spear to Meriones; this at least is\rwhat I should myself wish." \r\rKing Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones,\rand handed the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.\r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rBOOK XXIV\r\rThe assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to\rhis own ship. There they made ready their supper, and then bethought\rthem of the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still wept for thinking\rof his dear comrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow, could\rtake no hold upon him. This way and that did he turn as he yearned\rafter the might and manfulness of Patroclus; he thought of all they\rhad done together, and all they had gone through both on the field\rof battle and on the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt on these\rthings he wept bitterly and lay now on his side, now on his back,\rand now face downwards, till at last he rose and went out as one distraught\rto wander upon the seashore. Then, when he saw dawn breaking over\rbeach and sea, he yoked his horses to his chariot, and bound the body\rof Hector behind it that he might drag it about. Thrice did he drag\rit round the tomb of the son of Menoetius, and then went back into\rhis tent, leaving the body on the ground full length and with its\rface downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to be disfigured, for\rhe pitied the man, dead though he now was; therefore he shielded him\rwith his golden aegis continually, that he might take no hurt while\rAchilles was dragging him. \r\rThus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but the\rblessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged Mercury, slayer\rof Argus, to steal the body. All were of this mind save only Juno,\rNeptune, and Jove\'s grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in the hate\rwhich they had ever borne towards Ilius with Priam and his people;\rfor they forgave not the wrong done them by Alexandrus in disdaining\rthe goddesses who came to him when he was in his sheepyards, and preferring\rher who had offered him a wanton to his ruin. \r\rWhen, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come, Phoebus\rApollo spoke among the immortals saying, "You gods ought to be ashamed\rof yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did not Hector burn\ryou thigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? And now dare\ryou not rescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon, with\rhis mother and child, his father Priam, and his people, who would\rforthwith commit him to the flames, and give him his due funeral rites?\rSo, then, you would all be on the side of mad Achilles, who knows\rneither right nor ruth? He is like some savage lion that in the pride\rof his great strength and daring springs upon men\'s flocks and gorges\ron them. Even so has Achilles flung aside all pity, and all that conscience\rwhich at once so greatly banes yet greatly boons him that will heed\rit. man may lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost- a son, it\rmay be, or a brother born from his own mother\'s womb; yet when he\rhas mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for it takes\rmuch sorrow to kill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he has slain\rnoble Hector, drags him behind his chariot round the tomb of his comrade.\rIt were better of him, and for him, that he should not do so, for\rbrave though he be we gods may take it ill that he should vent his\rfury upon dead clay." \r\rJuno spoke up in a rage. "This were well," she cried, "O lord of the\rsilver bow, if you would give like honour to Hector and to Achilles;\rbut Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman\'s breast, whereas Achilles\ris the offspring of a goddess whom I myself reared and brought up.\rI married her to Peleus, who is above measure dear to the immortals;\ryou gods came all of you to her wedding; you feasted along with them\ryourself and brought your lyre- false, and fond of low company, that\ryou have ever been." \r\rThen said Jove, "Juno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not be\requal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was dearest to the gods,\ras also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. Never was my\raltar stinted of its dues, nor of the drink-offerings and savour of\rsacrifice which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the body\rof mighty Hector to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be without\rAchilles coming to know it, for his mother keeps night and day beside\rhim. Let some one of you, therefore, send Thetis to me, and I will\rimpart my counsel to her, namely that Achilles is to accept a ransom\rfrom Priam, and give up the body." \r\rOn this Iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. Down\rshe plunged into the dark sea midway between Samos and rocky Imbrus;\rthe waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into the bottom\ras the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carry death\rto fishes. She found Thetis sitting in a great cave with the other\rsea-goddesses gathered round her; there she sat in the midst of them\rweeping for her noble son who was to fall far from his own land, on\rthe rich plains of Troy. Iris went up to her and said, "Rise Thetis;\rJove, whose counsels fail not, bids you come to him." And Thetis answered,\r"Why does the mighty god so bid me? I am in great grief, and shrink\rfrom going in and out among the immortals. Still, I will go, and the\rword that he may speak shall not be spoken in vain." \r\rThe goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe more\rsombre, and went forth with fleet Iris leading the way before her.\rThe waves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the\rshore they flew up into the heavens, where they found the all-seeing\rson of Saturn with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled near\rhim. Minerva gave up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side\rof father Jove. Juno then placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and\rspoke to her in words of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her\rback the cup; and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.\r\r"So, goddess," said he, "for all your sorrow, and the grief that I\rwell know reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither to Olympus,\rand I will tell you why I have sent for you. This nine days past the\rimmortals have been quarrelling about Achilles waster of cities and\rthe body of Hector. The gods would have Mercury slayer of Argus steal\rthe body, but in furtherance of our peace and amity henceforward,\rI will concede such honour to your son as I will now tell you. Go,\rthen, to the host and lay these commands upon him; say that the gods\rare angry with him, and that I am myself more angry than them all,\rin that he keeps Hector at the ships and will not give him up. He\rmay thus fear me and let the body go. At the same time I will send\rIris to great Priam to bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans, and\rransom his son, taking with him such gifts for Achilles as may give\rhim satisfaction. \r\rSilver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith down\rshe darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to her son\'s\rtents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trusty comrades\rround him were busy preparing their morning meal, for which they had\rkilled a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside him and caressed\rhim with her hand saying, "My son, how long will you keep on thus\rgrieving and making moan? You are gnawing at your own heart, and think\rneither of food nor of woman\'s embraces; and yet these too were well,\rfor you have no long time to live, and death with the strong hand\rof fate are already close beside you. Now, therefore, heed what I\rsay, for I come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the gods are\rangry with you, and himself more angry than them all, in that you\rkeep Hector at the ships and will not give him up. Therefore let him\rgo, and accept a ransom for his body." \r\rAnd Achilles answered, "So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motion\rthus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away."\r\rThus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discourse\rwith one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris to the strong\rcity of Ilius. "Go," said he, "fleet Iris, from the mansions of Olympus,\rand tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to go to the ships of the\rAchaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to take such gifts\rwith him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and he is to go alone,\rwith no other Trojan, save only some honoured servant who may drive\rhis mules and waggon, and bring back the body of him whom noble Achilles\rhas slain. Let him have no thought nor fear of death in his heart,\rfor we will send the slayer of Argus to escort him, and bring him\rwithin the tent of Achilles. Achilles will not kill him nor let another\rdo so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he will\rentreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy." \r\rOn this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her message.\rShe went to Priam\'s house, and found weeping and lamentation therein.\rHis sons were seated round their father in the outer courtyard, and\rtheir raiment was wet with tears: the old man sat in the midst of\rthem with his mantle wrapped close about his body, and his head and\rneck all covered with the filth which he had clutched as he lay grovelling\rin the mire. His daughters and his sons\' wives went wailing about\rthe house, as they thought of the many and brave men who lay dead,\rslain by the Argives. The messenger of Jove stood by Priam and spoke\rsoftly to him, but fear fell upon him as she did so. "Take heart,"\rshe said, "Priam offspring of Dardanus, take heart and fear not. I\rbring no evil tidings, but am minded well towards you. I come as a\rmessenger from Jove, who though he be not near, takes thought for\ryou and pities you. The lord of Olympus bids you go and ransom noble\rHector, and take with you such gifts as shall give satisfaction to\rAchilles. You are to go alone, with no Trojan, save only some honoured\rservant who may drive your mules and waggon, and bring back to the\rcity the body of him whom noble Achilles has slain. You are to have\rno thought, nor fear of death, for Jove will send the slayer of Argus\rto escort you. When he has brought you within Achilles\' tent, Achilles\rwill not kill you nor let another do so, for he will take heed to\rhis ways and sin not, and he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable\rcourtesy." \r\rIris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his sons\rto get a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggon fast\rupon the top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrant store-room,\rhigh-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his many treasures were\rkept, and he called Hecuba his wife. "Wife," said he, "a messenger\rhas come to me from Olympus, and has told me to go to the ships of\rthe Achaeans to ransom my dear son, taking with me such gifts as shall\rgive satisfaction to Achilles. What think you of this matter? for\rmy own part I am greatly moved to pass through the of the Achaeans\rand go to their ships." \r\rHis wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, "Alas, what has become\rof that judgement for which you have been ever famous both among strangers\rand your own people? How can you venture alone to the ships of the\rAchaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain so many of your\rbrave sons? You must have iron courage, for if the cruel savage sees\ryou and lays hold on you, he will know neither respect nor pity. Let\rus then weep Hector from afar here in our own house, for when I gave\rhim birth the threads of overruling fate were spun for him that dogs\rshould eat his flesh far from his parents, in the house of that terrible\rman on whose liver I would fain fasten and devour it. Thus would I\ravenge my son, who showed no cowardice when Achilles slew him, and\rthought neither of Right nor of avoiding battle as he stood in defence\rof Trojan men and Trojan women." \r\rThen Priam said, "I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as a\rbird of ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had it been\rsome mortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divines\rfrom sacrifice- I should have deemed him false and have given him\rno heed; but now I have heard the goddess and seen her face to face,\rtherefore I will go and her saying shall not be in vain. If it be\rmy fate to die at the ships of the Achaeans even so would I have it;\rlet Achilles slay me, if I may but first have taken my son in my arms\rand mourned him to my heart\'s comforting." \r\rSo saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve goodly\rvestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs,\rtwelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighed out\rten talents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods, four\rcauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had given\rhim when he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious,\rbut he grudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body of\rhis son. Then he chased all the Trojans from the court and rebuked\rthem with words of anger. "Out," he cried, "shame and disgrace to\rme that you are. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are\rcome to plague me here? Is it a small thing, think you, that the son\rof Saturn has sent this sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my\rsons? Nay, you shall prove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans\rwill have easier work in killing you. As for me, let me go down within\rthe house of Hades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting of\rthe city." \r\rHe drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the old\rman sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding Helenus, Paris,\rnoble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loud battle-cry,\rDeiphobus, Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did the old man call near\rhim. "Come to me at once," he cried, "worthless sons who do me shame;\rwould that you had all been killed at the ships rather than Hector.\rMiserable man that I am, I have had the bravest sons in all Troy-\rnoble Nestor, Troilus the dauntless charioteer, and Hector who was\ra god among men, so that one would have thought he was son to an immortal-\ryet there is not one of them left. Mars has slain them and those of\rwhom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and light of foot, heroes\rof the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your own people, why\rdo you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and put all these things\rupon it that I may set out on my way?" \r\rThus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father. They\rbrought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body of\rthe waggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg on\rwhich it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it and\rrings for the reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-band eleven\rcubits long, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on at the\rfar end of the pole, and put the ring over the upright pin making\rit fast with three turns of the band on either side the knob, and\rbending the thong of the yoke beneath it. This done, they brought\rfrom the store-chamber the rich ransom that was to purchase the body\rof Hector, and they set it all orderly on the waggon; then they yoked\rthe strong harness-mules which the Mysians had on a time given as\ra goodly present to Priam; but for Priam himself they yoked horses\rwhich the old king had bred, and kept for own use. \r\rThus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of their\rcars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with a\rgolden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make a drink-offering\rbefore they set out. She stood in front of the horses and said, "Take\rthis, make a drink-offering to father Jove, and since you are minded\rto go to the ships in spite of me, pray that you may come safely back\rfrom the hands of your enemies. Pray to the son of Saturn lord of\rthe whirlwind, who sits on Ida and looks down over all Troy, pray\rhim to send his swift messenger on your right hand, the bird of omen\rwhich is strongest and most dear to him of all birds, that you may\rsee it with your own eyes and trust it as you go forth to the ships\rof the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove will not send you this messenger,\rhowever set upon it you may be, I would not have you go to the ships\rof the Argives." \r\rAnd Priam answered, "Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well\rto lift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon me."\r\rWith this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over\rhis hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. He washed\rhis hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the drink-offering\rand prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and turning his\reyes to heaven. "Father Jove," he said, "that rulest from Ida, most\rglorious and most great, grant that I may be received kindly and compassionately\rin the tents of Achilles; and send your swift messenger upon my right\rhand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to you of\rall birds, that I may see it with my own eyes and trust it as I go\rforth to the ships of the Danaans." \r\rSo did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer. Forthwith\rhe sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birds that fly,\rthe dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His wings were\rspread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made and well-bolted\rdoor of a rich man\'s chamber. He came to them flying over the city\rupon their right hands, and when they saw him they were glad and their\rhearts took comfort within them. The old man made haste to mount his\rchariot, and drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing\rgatehouse of the outer court. Before him went the mules drawing the\rfour-wheeled waggon, and driven by wise Idaeus; behind these were\rthe horses, which the old man lashed with his whip and drove swiftly\rthrough the city, while his friends followed after, wailing and lamenting\rfor him as though he were on his road to death. As soon as they had\rcome down from the city and had reached the plain, his sons and sons-in-law\rwho had followed him went back to Ilius. \r\rBut Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not escape\rthe ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old man and pitied\rhim; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, "Mercury, for it is\ryou who are the most disposed to escort men on their way, and to hear\rthose whom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam to the ships of\rthe Achaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see him nor take note\rof him until he reach the son of Peleus." \r\rThus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did\ras he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals\rwith which he could fly like the wind over land and sea; he took the\rwand with which he seals men\'s eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as\rhe pleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came to Troy and\rto the Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man of noble birth\rin the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon\rhis face. \r\rNow when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius,\rthey stayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river,\rfor the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus saw\rMercury standing near them he said to Priam, "Take heed, descendant\rof Dardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. I see a man\rwho I think will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses,\ror at least embrace his knees and implore him to take compassion upon\rus? \r\rWhen he heard this the old man\'s heart failed him, and he was in great\rfear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood on end\rover his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him and\rtook him by the hand, saying, "Whither, father, are you thus driving\ryour mules and horses in the dead of night when other men are asleep?\rAre you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hard by you, so\rcruel and relentless? Should some one of them see you bearing so much\rtreasure through the darkness of the flying night, what would not\ryour state then be? You are no longer young, and he who is with you\ris too old to protect you from those who would attack you. For myself,\rI will do you no harm, and I will defend you from any one else, for\ryou remind me of my own father." \r\rAnd Priam answered, "It is indeed as you say, my dear son; nevertheless\rsome god has held his hand over me, in that he has sent such a wayfarer\ras yourself to meet me so Opportunely; you are so comely in mien and\rfigure, and your judgement is so excellent that you must come of blessed\rparents." \r\rThen said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "Sir, all that\ryou have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you taking\rthis rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be\rsafe, or are you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now that your\rson has fallen who was the bravest man among you and was never lacking\rin battle with the Achaeans?" \r\rAnd Priam said, "Wo are you, my friend, and who are your parents,\rthat you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?"\r\rThe slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, "Sir, you would\rprove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a time have\rI set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argives to their\rships and putting them to the sword. We stood still and marvelled,\rfor Achilles in his anger with the son of Atreus suffered us not to\rfight. I am his squire, and came with him in the same ship. I am a\rMyrmidon, and my father\'s name is Polyctor: he is a rich man and about\ras old as you are; he has six sons besides myself, and I am the seventh.\rWe cast lots, and it fell upon me to sail hither with Achilles. I\ram now come from the ships on to the plain, for with daybreak the\rAchaeans will set battle in array about the city. They chafe at doing\rnothing, and are so eager that their princes cannot hold them back."\r\rThen answered Priam, "If you are indeed the squire of Achilles son\rof Peleus, tell me now the Whole truth. Is my son still at the ships,\ror has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his hounds?"\r\r"Sir," replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "neither hounds\rnor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying at the\rtents by the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve days that\rhe has lain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the worms eaten\rhim although they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles drags him\rcruelly round the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does him no\rhurt. You should come yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew, with\rthe blood all washed away, and his wounds every one of them closed\rthough many pierced him with their spears. Such care have the blessed\rgods taken of your brave son, for he was dear to them beyond all measure."\r\rThe old man was comforted as he heard him and said, "My son, see what\ra good thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals; for\ras sure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that hold\rOlympus, and now they requite it to him even in death. Accept therefore\rat my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and with heaven\'s help guide\rme till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus." \r\rThen answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, "Sir, you are\rtempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me,\rfor you are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilles\rwhom I fear and hold it great guiltless to defraud, lest some evil\rpresently befall me; but as your guide I would go with you even to\rArgos itself, and would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land,\rthat no one should attack you through making light of him who was\rwith you." \r\rThe bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and seizing\rthe whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules and horses.\rWhen they reached the trench and the wall that was before the ships,\rthose who were on guard had just been getting their suppers, and the\rslayer of Argus threw them all into a deep sleep. Then he drew back\rthe bolts to open the gates, and took Priam inside with the treasure\rhe had upon his waggon. Ere long they came to the lofty dwelling of\rthe son of Peleus for which the Myrmidons had cut pine and which they\rhad built for their king; when they had built it they thatched it\rwith coarse tussock-grass which they had mown out on the plain, and\rall round it they made a large courtyard, which was fenced with stakes\rset close together. The gate was barred with a single bolt of pine\rwhich it took three men to force into its place, and three to draw\rback so as to open the gate, but Achilles could draw it by himself.\rMercury opened the gate for the old man, and brought in the treasure\rthat he was taking with him for the son of Peleus. Then he sprang\rfrom the chariot on to the ground and said, "Sir, it is I, immortal\rMercury, that am come with you, for my father sent me to escort you.\rI will now leave you, and will not enter into the presence of Achilles,\rfor it might anger him that a god should befriend mortal men thus\ropenly. Go you within, and embrace the knees of the son of Peleus:\rbeseech him by his father, his lovely mother, and his son; thus you\rmay move him." \r\rWith these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprang from\rhis chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in charge\rof the mules and horses. The old man went straight into the house\rwhere Achilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found him\rwith his men seated at a distance from him: only two, the hero Automedon,\rand Alcimus of the race of Mars, were busy in attendance about his\rperson, for he had but just done eating and drinking, and the table\rwas still there. King Priam entered without their seeing him, and\rgoing right up to Achilles he clasped his knees and kissed the dread\rmurderous hands that had slain so many of his sons. \r\rAs when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have killed\rsome one in his own country, and must fly to a great man\'s protection\rin a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even so did Achilles\rmarvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked one to another and marvelled\ralso, but Priam besought Achilles saying, "Think of your father, O\rAchilles like unto the gods, who is such even as I am, on the sad\rthreshold of old age. It may be that those who dwell near him harass\rhim, and there is none to keep war and ruin from him. Yet when he\rhears of you being still alive, he is glad, and his days are full\rof hope that he shall see his dear son come home to him from Troy;\rbut I, wretched man that I am, had the bravest in all Troy for my\rsons, and there is not one of them left. I had fifty sons when the\rAchaeans came here; nineteen of them were from a single womb, and\rthe others were borne to me by the women of my household. The greater\rpart of them has fierce Mars laid low, and Hector, him who was alone\rleft, him who was the guardian of the city and ourselves, him have\ryou lately slain; therefore I am now come to the ships of the Achaeans\rto ransom his body from you with a great ransom. Fear, O Achilles,\rthe wrath of heaven; think on your own father and have compassion\rupon me, who am the more pitiable, for I have steeled myself as no\rman yet has ever steeled himself before me, and have raised to my\rlips the hand of him who slew my son." \r\rThus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as he bethought\rhim of his father. He took the old man\'s hand and moved him gently\raway. The two wept bitterly- Priam, as he lay at Achilles\' feet, weeping\rfor Hector, and Achilles now for his father and now for Patroclous,\rtill the house was filled with their lamentation. But when Achilles\rwas now sated with grief and had unburthened the bitterness of his\rsorrow, he left his seat and raised the old man by the hand, in pity\rfor his white hair and beard; then he said, "Unhappy man, you have\rindeed been greatly daring; how could you venture to come alone to\rthe ships of the Achaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain\rso many of your brave sons? You must have iron courage: sit now upon\rthis seat, and for all our grief we will hide our sorrows in our hearts,\rfor weeping will not avail us. The immortals know no care, yet the\rlot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Jove\'s palace\rthere stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other\rwith good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts\rhe sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he\rto whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger\rof scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world,\rand he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither\rby gods nor men. Even so did it befall Peleus; the gods endowed him\rwith all good things from his birth upwards, for he reigned over the\rMyrmidons excelling all men in prosperity and wealth, and mortal though\rhe was they gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on him too\rdid heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal children\rborn to him in his house, save one son who is doomed to die all untimely;\rnor may I take care of him now that he is growing old, for I must\rstay here at Troy to be the bane of you and your children. And you\rtoo, O Priam, I have heard that you were aforetime happy. They say\rthat in wealth and plenitude of offspring you surpassed all that is\rin Lesbos, the realm of Makar to the northward, Phrygia that is more\rinland, and those that dwell upon the great Hellespont; but from the\rday when the dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war and slaughter\rhave been about your city continually. Bear up against it, and let\rthere be some intervals in your sorrow. Mourn as you may for your\rbrave son, you will take nothing by it. You cannot raise him from\rthe dead, ere you do so yet another sorrow shall befall you."\r\rAnd Priam answered, "O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector is\rstill lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransom\rwhich I have brought you, and give him to me at once that I may look\rupon him. May you prosper with the ransom and reach your own land\rin safety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and to look upon\rthe light of the sun." \r\rAchilles looked at him sternly and said, "Vex me, sir, no longer;\rI am of myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother, daughter\rof the old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid me deliver\rit to you. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you cannot hide it,\rthat some god has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans, for else,\rno man however strong and in his prime would dare to come to our host;\rhe could neither pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt of my gates\rthus easily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest I sin against\rthe word of Jove, and suffer you not, suppliant though you are, within\rmy tents." \r\rThe old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus sprang like\ra lion through the door of his house, not alone, but with him went\rhis two squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to him than\rany others of his comrades now that Patroclus was no more. These unyoked\rthe horses and mules, and bade Priam\'s herald and attendant be seated\rwithin the house. They lifted the ransom for Hector\'s body from the\rwaggon. but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt, that Achilles\rmight wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home. Then\rhe called to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and anoint\rit, but he first took it to a place where Priam should not see it,\rlest if he did so, he should break out in the bitterness of his grief,\rand enrage Achilles, who might then kill him and sin against the word\rof Jove. When the servants had washed the body and anointed it, and\rhad wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilles himself lifted\rit on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the waggon. He\rcried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his dear comrade,\r"Be not angry with me, Patroclus," he said, "if you hear even in the\rhouse of Hades that I have given Hector to his father for a ransom.\rIt has been no unworthy one, and I will share it equitably with you."\r\rAchilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the richly\rinlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was at right\rangles to the one against which Priam was sitting. "Sir," he said,\r"your son is now laid upon his bier and is ransomed according to desire;\ryou shall look upon him when you him away at daybreak; for the present\rlet us prepare our supper. Even lovely Niobe had to think about eating,\rthough her twelve children- six daughters and six lusty sons- had\rbeen all slain in her house. Apollo killed the sons with arrows from\rhis silver bow, to punish Niobe, and Diana slew the daughters, because\rNiobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she said Leto had borne two\rchildren only, whereas she had herself borne many- whereon the two\rkilled the many. Nine days did they lie weltering, and there was none\rto bury them, for the son of Saturn turned the people into stone;\rbut on the tenth day the gods in heaven themselves buried them, and\rNiobe then took food, being worn out with weeping. They say that somewhere\ramong the rocks on the mountain pastures of Sipylus, where the nymphs\rlive that haunt the river Achelous, there, they say, she lives in\rstone and still nurses the sorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven.\rTherefore, noble sir, let us two now take food; you can weep for your\rdear son hereafter as you are bearing him back to Ilius- and many\ra tear will he cost you." \r\rWith this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of silvery\rwhiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all in due order.\rThey cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted them,\rand drew them off again when they were well roasted. Automedon brought\rbread in fair baskets and served it round the table, while Achilles\rdealt out the meat, and they laid their hands on the good things that\rwere before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\rPriam, descendant of Dardanus, marvelled at the strength and beauty\rof Achilles for he was as a god to see, and Achilles marvelled at\rPriam as he listened to him and looked upon his noble presence. When\rthey had gazed their fill Priam spoke first. "And now, O king," he\rsaid, "take me to my couch that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed\rboon of sleep. Never once have my eyes been closed from the day your\rhands took the life of my son; I have grovelled without ceasing in\rthe mire of my stable-yard, making moan and brooding over my countless\rsorrows. Now, moreover, I have eaten bread and drunk wine; hitherto\rI have tasted nothing." \r\rAs he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set beds\rin the room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with good red\rrugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks\rfor Priam and Idaeus to wear. So the maids went out carrying a torch\rand got the two beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles said laughingly\rto Priam, "Dear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor of\rthose who in due course keep coming to advise with me should see you\rhere in the darkness of the flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon.\rThis might cause delay in the delivery of the body. And now tell me\rand tell me true, for how many days would you celebrate the funeral\rrites of noble Hector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war and\rrestrain the host." \r\rAnd Priam answered, "Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble son\rwith all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be grateful. You\rknow how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetch\rwood from the mountain, and the people live in fear. Nine days, therefore,\rwill we mourn Hector in my house; on the tenth day we will bury him\rand there shall be a public feast in his honour; on the eleventh we\rwill build a mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth, if there be\rneed, we will fight." \r\rAnd Achilles answered, "All, King Priam, shall be as you have said.\rI will stay our fighting for as long a time as you have named."\r\rAs he spoke he laid his hand on the old man\'s right wrist, in token\rthat he should have no fear; thus then did Priam and his attendant\rsleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, while Achilles lay\rin an inner room of the house, with fair Briseis by his side.\r\rAnd now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the livelong\rnight, but upon Mercury alone, the bringer of good luck, sleep could\rtake no hold for he was thinking all the time how to get King Priam\raway from the ships without his being seen by the strong force of\rsentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam\'s head and said, "Sir,\rnow that Achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fear about\rsleeping in the thick of your foes. You have paid a great ransom,\rand have received the body of your son; were you still alive and a\rprisoner the sons whom you have left at home would have to give three\rtimes as much to free you; and so it would be if Agamemnon and the\rother Achaeans were to know of your being here." \r\rWhen he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.\rMercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quickly\rthrough the host so that no man perceived them. When they came to\rthe ford of eddying Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury went\rback to high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to break over\rall the land. Priam and Idaeus then drove on toward the city lamenting\rand making moan, and the mules drew the body of Hector. No one neither\rman nor woman saw them, till Cassandra, fair as golden Venus standing\ron Pergamus, caught sight of her dear father in his chariot, and his\rservant that was the city\'s herald with him. Then she saw him that\rwas lying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with a loud cry she\rwent about the city saying, "Come hither Trojans, men and women, and\rlook on Hector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming from battle\rwhen he was alive, look now on him that was the glory of our city\rand all our people." \r\rAt this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a sorrow\rhad possessed them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as he was bringing\rin the body. Hector\'s wife and his mother were the first to mourn\rhim: they flew towards the waggon and laid their hands upon his head,\rwhile the crowd stood weeping round them. They would have stayed before\rthe gates, weeping and lamenting the livelong day to the going down\rof the sun, had not Priam spoken to them from the chariot and said,\r"Make way for the mules to pass you. Afterwards when I have taken\rthe body home you shall have your fill of weeping." \r\rOn this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon. When\rthey had borne the body within the house they laid it upon a bed and\rseated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the women joined\rin the sad music of their lament. Foremost among them all Andromache\rled their wailing as she clasped the head of mighty Hector in her\rembrace. "Husband," she cried, "you have died young, and leave me\rin your house a widow; he of whom we are the ill-starred parents is\rstill a mere child, and I fear he may not reach manhood. Ere he can\rdo so our city will be razed and overthrown, for you who watched over\rit are no more- you who were its saviour, the guardian of our wives\rand children. Our women will be carried away captives to the ships,\rand I among them; while you, my child, who will be with me will be\rput to some unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may be,\rsome Achaean will hurl you (O miserable death) from our walls, to\ravenge some brother, son, or father whom Hector slew; many of them\rhave indeed bitten the dust at his hands, for your father\'s hand in\rbattle was no light one. Therefore do the people mourn him. You have\rleft, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to your parents, and my own grief\ris greatest of all, for you did not stretch forth your arms and embrace\rme as you lay dying, nor say to me any words that might have lived\rwith me in my tears night and day for evermore." \r\rBitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament.\rHecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. "Hector," she cried,\r"dearest to me of all my children. So long as you were alive the gods\rloved you well, and even in death they have not been utterly unmindful\rof you; for when Achilles took any other of my sons, he would sell\rhim beyond the seas, to Samos Imbrus or rugged Lemnos; and when he\rhad slain you too with his sword, many a time did he drag you round\rthe sepulchre of his comrade- though this could not give him life-\ryet here you lie all fresh as dew, and comely as one whom Apollo has\rslain with his painless shafts." \r\rThus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and then\rHelen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation. "Hector,"\rsaid she, "dearest of all my brothers-in-law-for I am wife to Alexandrus\rwho brought me hither to Troy- would that I had died ere he did so-\rtwenty years are come and gone since I left my home and came from\rover the sea, but I have never heard one word of insult or unkindness\rfrom you. When another would chide with me, as it might be one of\ryour brothers or sisters or of your brothers\' wives, or my mother-in-law-\rfor Priam was as kind to me as though he were my own father- you would\rrebuke and check them with words of gentleness and goodwill. Therefore\rmy tears flow both for you and for my unhappy self, for there is no\rone else in Troy who is kind to me, but all shrink and shudder as\rthey go by me." \r\rShe wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round her\rjoined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying, "Bring\rwood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of the Argives,\rfor Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave me his word\rthat they should not attack us until the morning of the twelfth day."\r\rForthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together before\rthe city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps wood, and on\rthe morning of the tenth day with many tears they took trave Hector\rforth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, and set the\rfire thereto. Then when the child of morning rosy-fingered dawn appeared\ron the eleventh day, the people again assembled, round the pyre of\rmighty Hector. When they were got together, they first quenched the\rfire with wine wherever it was burning, and then his brothers and\rcomrades with many a bitter tear gathered his white bones, wrapped\rthem in soft robes of purple, and laid them in a golden urn, which\rthey placed in a grave and covered over with large stones set close\rtogether. Then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keeping guard\ron every side lest the Achaeans should attack them before they had\rfinished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went back again\rinto the city, and being well assembled they held high feast in the\rhouse of Priam their king. \r\rThus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer of horses.\r\rTHE END\r\r----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\rCopyright statement:\rThe Internet Classics Archive by Daniel C.
